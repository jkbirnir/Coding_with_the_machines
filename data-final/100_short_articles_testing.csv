0,"Sections Extras Watch Now President Donald Trump said Monday that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US is not the fault of Asian-Americans, a group that has been the target of a growing number of racist and xenophobic attacks related to the virus. ‚ÄúIt is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,‚Äù Trump tweeted Monday evening. ‚ÄúThey are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus (‚Ä¶) is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it.

They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus‚Ä¶. ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020¬† Trump‚Äôs call to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù these Americans comes less than a week after he defended his use of the terms ‚ÄúChina virus‚Äù and ‚ÄúChinese virus‚Äù to describe Covid-19 ‚Äî which originated in Wuhan, China. After consulting with medical experts, and receiving guidance from the World Health Organization, CNN has determined that that name is both inaccurate and is considered stigmatizing. Last week, Trump claimed that he was using the term because China tried to blame the virus on US soldiers. ‚ÄúBecause it comes from China. It‚Äôs not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that‚Äôs why. I want to be accurate,‚Äù Trump said at the time. Pressed again, he said: ‚ÄúI have great love for all of the people from our country, but as you know China tried to say at one point ‚Ä¶ that it was caused by American soldiers. That can‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs not gonna happen, not as long as I‚Äôm President. It comes from China.‚Äù He also denied that it was a racist term to use.

0,"A 16-year-old boy is paralyzed after a car accident Friday in Reno County, according to the family. Deputies say a small pickup truck was traveling westbound on east 4th Avenue when the driver lost control on slick roads and veered into a ditch. The pickup then rolled several times. Raiden Stewart was trapped inside. Hutchinson firefighters extracted Raiden from the pickup, and he was taken to Wesley Medical Center for treatment. His mother, Tara Stewart, says her son Raiden had surgery Saturday. She says he is paralyzed from the chest down and has limited arm movement. He fractured his spinal cord and will most likely not be able to walk again. He also has damage to his vertebral artery. Stewart says her son is a Buhler High School junior who is part of the wrestling and football team. He just took first place at the Douglas Varsity Wrestling Tournament and recently took second place at the Abilene Varsity Wrestling Tournament. Raiden's coaches say he inspired people on the football field and on the wrestling. While the prognosis is difficult, they say Raiden is already making strides in his recovery. ""His mental toughness will probably help carry him along as well. Not just his physical strength,"" said Buhler wrestling coach, Mike Zeyen. ""He has a big heart,"" said Buhler High School head football coach, Steve Warner. ""He knows he can handle it and he's going to fight."" Warner said a lot of students have traveled to see Raiden and his family. His mom is asking for thoughts and prayers in this difficult time. After he is released from the hospital, Raiden will go to a spinal rehabilitation center in either Denver or Omaha. Family and friends have set up a to help with expenses. There is also a fundraiser, set for Tuesday (Jan. 21) from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Spangles located at 120 east 4th Avenue (Hutchinson). Some of the proceeds will be given to the family."
0,"Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) president Prakash Ambedkar Tuesday reiterated his reservations to the proposed statue for Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar and suggested that an international study centre dedicated to the architect of the Indian Constitution would be a better tribute. The Dalit leader‚Äôs comments come days after he suggested the Bombay High Court asked the state government to utilise funds sanctioned for the proposed statue of his grandfather at Indu Mill in Mumbai for improvement of the cash-strapped Wadia hospitals for women and children instead. ‚ÄúThe greatness of B R Ambedkar cannot be measured with the height of a statue. It is a futile exercise undertaken by successive governments to serve their politics,‚Äù Prakash Ambedkar told The Indian Express. On January 15, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had approved a proposal to raise the height of the proposed statue for Ambedkar by 100 feet and cleared the revised expenditure of Rs 1089.95 crore from Rs 750 crore for it. The VBA chief said, ‚ÄúI have conveyed my reservation to the present plan for the memorial with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. I have also offered to discuss with them my original concept, which was evolved way back in 1998-99 when the NDA government was at the Centre.‚Äù He added then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given his consent for an Ambedkar International Study Centre, but could never be translated into reality as mainstream political parties, including BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP, were keen on a memorial and a statue. ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of having another statue of Ambedkar in Mumbai? At the most, it will be taller than the ones already existing at Chembur and Vidhan Bhawan. And political parties will just take the credit for the same and use it for their vote bank in successive elections‚Ä¶ Let us not reduce the proposed Ambedkar memorial to a picnic spot or tourism centre,‚Äù the Dalit leader said while pressing for a world-class study centre. üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

0,"By Fr. Benedict Mayaki, SJ A Jesuit apostolate in the Indian State of Bihar is working in collaboration with a government agency to provide food for thousands of poor people, especially the most disadvantaged among the Dalit communities during the imposed coronavirus lockdown period in India. Manthan, a Jesuit social action center involved in working with the Dalit or ‚Äòuntouchables‚Äô in the Hindu caste system, provided food parcels to about 5,000 poor people in Patna, the state capital. They also distributed foodstuff to widows, the elderly and the sick. Fr. Juno Sebastian SJ, the director of Manthan, said that this initiative came about after he was contacted by many people who said that they had not eaten for days. He immediately got in contact with officials of the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) who agreed to support his idea to feed the poor. ‚ÄúNow we are distributing cooked meals to 1,500 of them daily, and we will continue until the end of the isolation. We are also working to help 6,500 Musahar families in Patna, for a total of about 40,000 people,‚Äù Fr. Sebastian said. The distribution of food takes place in the slums and villages where the Jesuit Provincial of the Patna Province, Father Donald Miranda, SJ, said that they have managed to reach 700 other families. It has also been extended to parts of Uttar Pradesh where about 3,000 families are also able to be fed daily. The Jesuit College of St. Xavier in Patna is also involved in distributing food to about 530 families in the area. Even though the Bihar state government distributes food to the people free of charge, many Dalits do not have access to it because they have no documents to prove where they live or their identity. On 24 March, the Indian government announced a nationwide lockdown as part of precautionary measures to stem the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The lockdown has been hard on the poor and the vulnerable especially the Dalit communities, who are predominantly menial workers in the suburbs of Patna, the capital of Bihar. India presently has 18,658 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections with 592 deaths and 3,273 recovered patients. Pope's Activities Our Faith Useful Information Other sites Our channels"

The plea, filed by National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC) seeking Scheduled Caste status for Dalit Christians, also sought that the Scheduled Castes community be made religion-neutral. A bench comprising Chief Justice S A Bobde and justices Surya Kant and B R Gavai issued notice to the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, National Commission for Scheduled Castes, National Commission for Minorities and Registrar General of India. The apex court sought the government‚Äôs response in two weeks and tagged the matter along with a similar matter. ‚ÄúAllow and extend the Scheduled Castes status to Christians of Scheduled Castes Origin for availing special privilege in education, scholarships, employment, welfare measures, panchayat elections, legislative assemblies up to Indian Parliament and for availing the legal remedy/protection under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention) of Atrocities Act, 1989 amended in the year 2018,‚Äù the plea said. The plea said that a Scheduled Caste person professing a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism and Buddhism cannot be deprived of the benefit of Paragraph 3 of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950. It also said that change in religion does not change social exclusion and caste hierarchy continues to hold fort within Christianity even though the religion forbids it. The petition contended that paragraph three of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 restricts Christians of Scheduled Castes origin from availing the Scheduled Castes status. It said that this restriction was against the fundamental right to equality, religious freedom and non-discrimination. (With PTI inputs) üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

0,"Sign in Dalit History Month Apr 11, 2020¬∑2 min read Today in #Dalithistory, in honour of Mahatma Phule Jayanthi, we dedicate our post to Jyotirao Phule ‚Äî an activist, a thinker, and a social revolutionary of the nineteenth century. While he was of Shudra background, his ideas, work and actions have had an invaluable liberatory impact on Dalits. Born in 1827 before the widespread Adi-movements, Phule was the first to propound caste as subjugation and oppression on indigenous peoples by invaders. He stressed that caste was equivalent to slavery, as vicious and brutal as the enslavement of Africans in the Americas and unique in its deception and religious sanction. In his revolutionary book, Gulamgiri (Slavery) published in 1873, Jyotirao included a manifesto which amongst other things declared that he was willing to dine with all regardless of their caste, creed or country of origin and that social salvation was to be found only in the education of women and Dalits. This content was deemed extremely controversial at the time and several newspapers blatantly refused to publicize it. He believed that Shudras were a group of people who had suffered added repression and persecution because they had at one time been actively engaged in fighting invading Brahmanism on the ground. His salvation describes the unity of the Shudras and Adi-Shudras (Dalits) into one exploited mass of people rising up in powerful political unity. He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, became pioneers of women‚Äôs education in India, and together started the first school for girls on January 1st 1848 at Bhide‚Äôs wada in Pune.

It also found Asian American and white applicants have one-tenth to one-fourth the likelihood of admission as African American applicants with similar credentials.In a letter sent to the university's attorneys, Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, said that the department has ""determined that Yale violated, and is continuing to violate, Title VI."" Title VI of the 1965 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin in programs that receive federal financial assistance. The Supreme Court has ruled that colleges that receive federal funds can consider an applicants' race, along with other factors, but Yale's use of race ""is anything but limited,"" the DOJ said.""Yale‚Äôs use of race at multiple steps of its admissions process results in a multiplied effect of race on an applicant‚Äôs likelihood of admission,"" Dreiband said in the letter.In a statement, Yale said it ""categorically denies"" the DOJ's allegation of discrimination, and called the investigation ""meritless"" and ""hasty.""""At Yale, we look at the whole person when selecting whom to admit among the many thousands of highly qualified applicants,"" the statement said, adding that the Ivy League school takes into account factors such as their ""academic achievement, interests, demonstrated leadership, background, success in taking maximum advantage of their secondary school and community resources, and the likelihood that they will contribute to the Yale community and the world.""Yale said that it has been complying with the DOJ's investigation and had not yet provided all the information the department had requested. ""Had the Department fully received and fairly weighed this information, it would have concluded that Yale‚Äôs practices absolutely comply with decades of Supreme Court precedent,"" the statement said.In its letter, the DOJ demanded that Yale stop using race or national origin in its upcoming 2020-2021 admissions cycle. The university could also choose to submit a plan to the DOJ that does consider race or national origin that is ""narrowly tailored as required by law,"" including a date to stop using race in its admissions process. The letter gives Yale until Aug. 27 to comply with the DOJ's demands or risk facing a federal lawsuit.Yale said it does not plan to change its admissions process.""We are proud of Yale‚Äôs admissions practices, and we will not change them on the basis of such a meritless, hasty accusation,"" the university said in its statement.Copyright ¬© 2020, ABC Audio.

In a fresh case, a Dalit groom, who is serving in the Indian Army, was not allowed to ride a mare on his wedding day in Gujarat. The groom and the wedding party (baraat) was pelted with stones when it was proceeding to the wedding venue in the state's Banaskantha district. What was shocking was that the miscreants from another community attacked the wedding party despite police protection being provided to the groom. Open threats to Dalit family According to a report in Indian Express, the incident took place on January 16 (Sunday) at Sharifda village when the 22-year-old groom identified as Akash Kumar Koitiya began his wedding procession. Koitiya has just finished his training with the military police and was scheduled to deploy in the Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh. The jawan was on leave for his wedding. The groom's family said they had received threats from the Thakor Koli community not to pass the wedding procession through the village if the jawan rode a mare. """"After threats, we had requested police to give us protection. Police gave us 6-7 personnel for the security of the wedding procession. As we started to move, some people started to throw stones at us. The groom barely escaped injuries and was rushed to a police van. However, three persons including two women sustained injuries in the stone-pelting,"""" said Vijay Koitita, the groom's brother. The groom's family had received threats in advance from the upper caste if the youth rode the mare (Representative image) Police protection to groom Vijay is also an army man and is currently deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. After the attack, a number of policemen were rushed to the village. """"A contingent of 50-60 policemen was sent to accompany the wedding procession to the bride's village that was in Sundha area of Palanpur city. Later, the wedding passed off without any incident,"""" said Dalpat Bhatia, a Dalit rights activist. Meanwhile, police said they have booked 11 persons from the Thakor Koli community after the complaint by the groom's family. The case was filed at Gadh police station. According to police, the accused have been identified as Tushar Koli, Deepak Koli, Bhavan Koli, Vinod, Deepak Ishwar, Jeet, Manju, Ramaji, Bai Koli, Senaji, Shivaji Koli."
0,"Hi, Logout Months after the Supreme Court paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday announced a trust in the Parliament for the temple's construction. Further, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust will have one member from the Dalit community. The member is Kameshwar Chaupal, the """"first kar sevak."""" Chaupal told BBC Hindi that he only learned of his inclusion in the trust upon Wednesday's announcement. Speaking on his appointment, Chaupal said, """"I think the Modi government has only included those who are deeply devoted to Hinduism, Hindutva and saint traditions."""" He said he wasn't appointed solely because he is a Dalit, but because of his advocacy for the temple from the get-go. Born on April 24, 1956, Chaupal hails from Bihar's Mithila region. In Hinduism, it is believed that the region was home to Goddess Sita, before she married the Hindu God Rama and moved to Ayodhya. Chaupal said that although Rama may be a God to the rest of the world, in Mithila, he is treated as a son-in-law, BBC reported. While pursuing a Master's degree from the Mithila University in Darbhanga, Chaupal joined the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) in 1984. The same year, the VHP organized a Hindu Sammelan at Delhi's Vigyan Bhavan. Chaupal participated in the conference. He said it was at the Hindu Sammelan that a nationwide public awareness campaign for the construction of a Ram temple was announced. Chaupal said that before the foundation stone for the Ram temple was laid in 1989, saints and religious leaders at a Kumbh Mela had decided that a Dalit would do the honor. VHP and RSS leaders settled on November 9, 1989, as the 'auspicious' date for shilanyas (laying of foundation stone). Chaupal was then the VHP joint general secretary in-charge of Bihar's tribal-dominated districts. """"Coincidentally, religious leaders invited me to lay the temple's first brick,"""" Chaupal told BBC. Speaking to News 18 in 2017 on the events of November 9, 1989, Chaupal recalled that he was not informed that he had been chosen to lay the temple's foundation until the last minute. Then-VHP leader Ashok Singhal's close aide Rameshwar reportedly informed Chaupal of his duties that very morning. Then aged 34, Chaupal laid the temple's first brick at the shilanyas site, close to where the Babri Mosque once stood. He was also sat beside Singhal at the ceremony. Chaupal told News 18, """"I could hardly comprehend what was happening. I was an ordinary worker, sitting with who's who of the Hindu religious leadership."""" In 1992, the mosque was demolished by kar sevaks. As he rose to prominence, Chaupal tried his hand at politics, contesting the 1991 Lok Sabha elections from Rosada on a BJP ticket. However, he lost. He then unsuccessfully contested the 1995 Bihar Assembly polls from Begusarai. In 2002, he was elected to the Bihar Legislative Council and served two terms. He also contested the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Supaul, but lost.  Want to share it with your friends too? Love India news? Subscribe to stay updated."

This puts Asian Americans in harm‚Äôs way and is yet another example of the president‚Äôs long history of attacking communities of color. This bigotry is also spreading to other leading public officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Sen. John Cornyn, who recently responded to a question about coronavirus by blaming China and citing ‚Äúthe culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that.‚Äù The following is a statement from Muslim Advocates Executive Director Farhana Khera: ‚ÄúDuring a time of national crisis when many Americans are scared and suffering, we need our leaders to unite the country, not divide us for political gain. President Trump‚Äôs use of the term ‚ÄòChinese Virus‚Äô to describe the coronavirus is vile and a distraction. Sen. Cornyn‚Äôs embrace of schoolyard, anti-Asian stereotypes about eating bats and dogs is deeply offensive and won‚Äôt help us fight the virus. Racism is not a disinfectant. These harmful words have serious, real-world consequences. By whipping up anti-Asian hysteria, President Trump, Cornyn and other public officials resorting to xenophobia are giving people a license to hate and threaten Asian Americans. Let‚Äôs be clear: President Trump and his allies are once again stoking racism to distract from the truth: his administration has failed to protect the American people from possibly the gravest health and economic catastrophe in our lifetimes. President Trump, we are in a crisis. Do your job.

Amit Shah's statement comes a little over an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in Lok Sabha about the constitution of the trust. """"There will be 15 trustees in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from the Dalit society,"""" he tweeted. Amit Shah congratulated PM Modi """"for such an unprecedented decision"""" that strengthens social harmony. Amit Shah said that the trust will be independent to take every decision related to the temple and 67 acres of land will be transferred to it. """"I fully believe that the waiting of millions of people for centuries will be over soon and they will be able to pay obeisance to Lord Shri Ram in his grand temple at his birthplace,"""" he said. Amit Shah thanked PM Modi for his commitment for construction of a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, """"who is a symbol of faith and unwavering reverence of India"""". """"Today is a day of immense joy and pride for the whole country,"""" Amit Shah said in another tweet. Amit Shah said that as per the Supreme Court order on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, the central government has taken a historic decision to form a trust in the name of Lord Ram, showing its commitment towards the construction of the grand temple in Ayodhya. While making the announcement for the trust in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister said that the Union Cabinet also decided to transfer 67.703 acre land to the trust. The Uttar Pradesh government has agreed to give five acres of land to the UP Sunni Wakf Board as directed by the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya matter, Modi said. The Uttar Pradesh government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said that the land is in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya on the Lucknow highway, about 18 kilometres from the district headquarters. While delivering the judgement on November 9, the Supreme Court had said that the trust should be formed within three months for the construction of the temple at the site where many Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.

One of the groups that runs the risk of being undercounted is Asian Americans. According to a Census Bureau study, only 55 percent of the community say they are ‚Äúextremely‚Äù or ‚Äúvery‚Äù likely to fill out the census. That percentage is lower than white (69 percent) Hispanic (65 percent) and black populations (64 percent). But some Asian American groups in Texas are trying to make sure that underrepresentation doesn't happen. And they're coming up with new ideas, since knocking on doors and holding outreach events are not possible right now. Shubhada Saxena is the founder of Asian American Impact and the organization is encouraging the community to come up with fun videos with song, poetry, dance and other fun activities to tell people the importance of the census. ‚ÄúWe had a project or event set for March 29. Unfortunately, because of the current situation, we could not have a physical event. So we made that into a virtual space where now children are at home with their families. So they are creating videos with their families with different generations and telling the story differently,‚Äù said Saxena. Malin Pathak is an IT professional in Austin and won the Mrs. South Asia International title last year. She put together a video in different languages to reach people of more than 40 countries who are counted as Asian Americans. ‚ÄúI thought it would be perfect to get some of my friends, specifically from Asia, come together in one single video and be able to inspire their own respective communities,‚Äù said Pathak. They are encouraging people to post videos on their Census 2020 Facebook page with #Iamcounted or email the videos to seema@cosmocitymedia.com."

This type of language used by the president of the United States and the Chairwoman of the Republican Party of Minnesota is deeply harmful to Asian American communities in Minnesota and furthers divisiveness when we should be working together to end this pandemic. Like all Americans, Asian Americans are experiencing the daily pain that COVID-19 has had on the health and economic well-being of our communities. On top of all this, we have seen a rise in anti-Asian racism against many of our communities across the United States, including Minnesota. In one incident recently, a young Asian couple in Minnesota came home to a note on their door saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre watching you. Take the Chinese virus back to China. We don‚Äôt want you here infecting us with your diseases! Signed, your friendly neighborhood.‚Äù The labels ‚ÄúChina Virus,‚Äù ‚ÄúWuhan Virus,‚Äù or ‚ÄúKung Flu‚Äù exacerbate this racism and invite the general public to blame anyone who is perceived to be Chinese for causing this pandemic. The continued broadcasting of these terms through the megaphone of the president and the MN GOP Chairwoman furthers the harm towards Asian American communities in Minnesota. This must stop immediately. The reality is that there have been failures at all levels of government to address the needs of our communities at this time. Instead of excusing language and shifting blame onto everyday Asian Americans who are trying to survive this deadly pandemic, the Chairwoman should be working within her party to understand the harm that has directly impacted Asian Americans at this time. We urge her to not make excuses for racism and ask that she work with her party and all levels of government to bring our communities together so that support and aid reaches all those in need. Chair Carnahan needs to denounce the president‚Äôs offensive comments, clearly state that Chinese and Asian communities are not to blame for the pandemic, and get to work to help solve this crisis.

They also alleged negligence in getting treatment to the victim. The victim, identified as Jitendra Khatik alias Jeetu was taken into custody on suspicion that he was buying things from thieves and selling them. No such FIR has been registered with the police station despite that he was taken into custody in the name of interrogation, the family members alleged. As the protests started in Barmer, SP Sharad Choudhary suspended the SHO and removed all members of police station staff; however, he himself was removed and put on APO by government later in the day on Thursday. The family members said that Jitendra was tortured after he was taken into custody.

This means I can be in Hamilton.‚Äù According to Inside Edition, Leo is a mega-fan of Lin Manuel Miranda‚Äôs hit Broadway musical. He now believes he can have a future on Broadway as an Asian American after seeing Lee, a swing performer for Hamilton, on stage. Lee is the first Asian American male performer to join the Broadway company and is now this New Jersey boy‚Äôs newest role model. ‚ÄúI want to be a swing like Eddy,‚Äù Leo said in an interview with Inside Edition, ‚Äúand then maybe even work my way up to Hamilton.‚Äù Mindy says their family loves the diversity in the show. ‚ÄúHamilton is probably one of the first shows that we‚Äôve ever seen that really went out of its way to make sure that everyone had an opportunity to be on that stage, and that meant a lot to us,‚Äù she told Inside Edition. On July 3, Leo threw a watch party for the Hamilton premiere on Disney+. He transformed his home to look like the Richard Rodgers Theatre in New York City, where Hamilton is performed. He set up a ticket booth, where fellow viewers would present their ticket before entering the watch area in his living room. To the side, Leo set up a gift shop that included Hamilton T-shirts, an Alexander Hamilton book, and a Benjamin Franklin costume. His living room was filled with balloons, decorations, and posters of the different characters‚Äô silhouettes to replicate the painted doors of the Richard Rodgers Theatre. Keeping the Hamilton theme going, Leo put character and song names into the food dishes that are served which include ‚ÄúPeggy‚Äôs in a blanket‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll Be Baby Back Ribs.‚Äù This is not the first time Leo has been recognized for his love for Hamilton. In 2018, Inside Edition showed Hamilton creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda a video of Leo rapping along to part of a Hamilton song.

The police in Palwal district of Haryana have arrested three people for allegedly attacking a Dalit family for not switching off the lights at 9 pm on April 5, as suggested by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, The Indian Express reported on Wednesday. The accused, belonging to the Gujjar community, allegedly barged into the house of a Dalit family in Pingore village around 9.30 pm on April 5 and attacked eight people. Dhanpal, the complainant, alleged that the accused used casteist slurs and told them to keep their house lights switched off for the whole night. Besides Dhanpal, his son and daughter and five other family members sustained injuries. The accused were armed with sticks, iron rods and bricks, Dhanpal alleged. They also indulged in vandalism, he said. Dhanpal, contradicting the attackers, said he had switched off the lights of his home for nine minutes on April 5. Sadar Station House Officer Jitendra Kumar said that the children of the two families sparred over switching off the lights. Following this, the families began to throw stones at each other, he claimed. They also damaged a vehicle. A case has been registered on charges of causing hurt and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code. The provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have also been invoked, The Tribune reported.

The home minister's statement comes a little over an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in Lok Sabha about the constitution of the trust. """"There will be 15 trustees in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from the Dalit society,"""" he tweeted. Shah congratulated Modi """"for such an unprecedented decision"""" that strengthens social harmony. The home minister said the trust will be independent to take every decision related to the temple and 67 acres of land will be transferred to it. """"I fully believe that the waiting of millions of people for centuries will be over soon and they will be able to pay obeisance to Lord Shri Ram in his grand temple at his birthplace,"""" he said. Shah thanked the prime minister for his commitment for construction of a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, """"who is a symbol of faith and unwavering reverence of India"""". """"Today is a day of immense joy and pride for the whole country,"""" he said in another tweet. He said as per the Supreme Court order on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, the central government has taken a historic decision to form a trust in the name of Lord Ram, showing its commitment towards the construction of the grand temple in Ayodhya. While making the announcement for the trust in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister said the Union Cabinet also decided to transfer 67.703 acre land to the trust. The Uttar Pradesh government has agreed to give five acres of land to the UP Sunni Wakf Board as directed by the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya matter, Modi said. UP government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said the land is in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya on the Lucknow highway, about 18 kilometres from the district headquarters. While delivering the judgement on November 9, the Supreme Court had said the trust should be formed within three months for the construction of the temple at the site where many Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.

According to the police, the body of Rao was found in the Arya Vaishya Bhavan in Khairatabad on Sunday morning. The wife of Rao had claimed that he had been missing since Saturday. Police said they have not registered a case and it appeared that Rao had taken his own life.  """"Maruti Rao was found dead in the morning. He has committed suicide, the case has not yet registered. Further investigation underway,"""" Saifabad Deputy Commissioner of Police said. He was the main accused in the murder of Pranay Perumalla, the 24-year-old Dalit man who was killed in September 2018. Perumalla was married to Amrutha, the daughter of Rao, who was against the marriage as the boy was a Dalit while Rao's family belonged to the upper caste. Pranay belonged to Madiga scheduled caste whereas Amrutha was from Vysya caste.  Perumalla was hacked to death by a hitman hired by Rao, in front of his mother and Amrutha who was pregnant at the time, outside a hospital in Miryalaguda while they were stepping out. The entire incident was caught on CCTV camera and had sent shockwaves across the state and the country. The CCTV images revealed that the attacker had conducted the recce of the area. Amrutha later told police that she suspected her father, Maruthi Rao, to be behind the murder because her family was against their marriage and wanted to have her child aborted.  He had allegedly paid Rs 1 crore to get Perumalla killed. During the investigation, it came to light that the assassins had made four previous attempts to kill him, but had failed. Rao, who was arrested in the case, was out on bail. In June last year, the police had filed the charge sheet in the case naming Rao as the prime accused and seven others, including Subash Sharma - the man who hacked Perumalla to death. Family members alleged that he ended life due to the harassment by the police. Amrutha, however, felt that her father could have ended his life due to the guilt of killing Pranay """"We have no clarity yet, my father might have committed suicide due to regret after they killed Pranay. I never spoke to him nor saw him after that."""" Amrutha, who was pregnant at the time, has since given birth to a baby boy. Start a conversation, not a fire. Post with kindness.

In separate announcements, the Democratic presidential contenders' campaigns said they exercised caution about holding large public gatherings after hearing guidance from public health officials. Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns thanked supporters who planned to attend the events on a crucial day in the race to decide who faces President Donald Trump in November. In a statement, Sanders communications director Mike Casca said the Vermont senator's campaign will evaluate future events ""on a case by case basis."" Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said the campaign will ""make announcements about future events in the coming days."" The Democratic front-runner plans to deliver remarks at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:30 p.m. ET. Asked Tuesday about Trump's plans for future rallies, Vice President Mike Pence said the campaign would make decisions ""literally on a day to day basis."" He added that he is confident the campaign ""will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward."" The cancellations come at a pivotal time for the rivals jockeying for position in the Democratic primary. Six states, including crucial Michigan, hold presidential nominating contests on Tuesday as Biden tries to amass enough delegates to pull the Democratic nomination out of Sanders' reach. Ohio, which awards a significant 136 pledged delegates, votes next week. Read more: Biden and Sanders' fight over trade is a war for the future of the Democratic Party Questions have swirled about when the outbreak would affect a closely watched and consequential Democratic primary. Mass gatherings where the virus could spread make up a core part of Sanders' strategy. Biden relies less on rallies than his rival. Washington state, one of the areas in the U.S. most affected by the outbreak, holds its primary on Tuesday. While voters cast ballots by mail and will not physically go to the polls and risk spreading coronavirus, the state told voters not to lick envelopes.

0,"Published 10:32, 24 October 2020 BST| Last updated 10:37, 24 October 2020 BST It's been another fairly standard week for Marcus Rashford. Last Saturday he was bagging against Newcastle, on Tuesday he scored the winner against Paris Saint Germain, and since returning to British soil he has been working tirelessly to help feed disadvantaged children during half term. On Thursday, MPs voted against a motion to extend free school meals during the half term break amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But Manchester United and England forward Rashford - or Rashford MBE as we should now call him - did not give up the fight. As well as mucking in to lend a hand at the FareShare warehouse with his mum, the 22-year-old has also been helming a movement on Twitter. Using the hashtag #endchildfoodpoverty, he collated pubs, restaurants and cafes across the country that are stepping up to offer free meals during the half term break. After going at it all day yesterday (23 October), Rashford said he was knocking off with a feeling of 'pride'. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he said: """"Growing up we didn't have a lot, but we always had the safety net of the community. That community was my family. When we stumbled, we were caught with open arms. """"Even at their lowest point, having felt the devastating effects of the pandemic, local businesses have wrapped arms around their communities today, catching vulnerable children as they fell. """"I couldn't be more proud to call myself British tonight. I am truly overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. """"You want to talk about 'celebrities' and 'superstars', look no further than my Twitter feed and that's exactly what you'll find."""" He's not wrong either - here's just a handful of places that are helping out:  If you head to his Twitter feed you will find many more. In Scotland and Wales, governments have extended free meals during school holidays until Easter, while in Northern Ireland they'll be provided over the half-term break this month. A number of councils in England, including those in Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool, have also agreed to supply disadvantaged pupils with vouchers. McDonald's is also partnering with FareShare to offer one million free meals. You can find the businesses, services and organisations offering free meals over the school holidays near you by entering your postcode into this school meal finder.

But as I noted above, a border crossing was already temporarily shut down ‚Äì which is clearly an illegal act. This is no surprise. Weakness invites further challenge, and by refusing to enforce the laws, the Trudeau Liberals have shown immense weakness. Lawbreakers, radical blockaders, have been given reign over our railways, shutting them down with impunity and without consequence. As a result, more and more radicals will be emboldened to violate the law, and the biggest victims of all this will be the hard-working law-abiding Canadian taxpayers who pay the bills for this country.

Holding the placard with the slogans, she was spotted sitting among the participants of the protest organised by the Hindu Jagaran Vedike against the woman who had shouted """"Pakistan Zindabad"""" on Thursday. City police chief Bhaskar Rao said she was escorted out of the place as the Vedike members asked her to leave and crowd started gathering. """"She has been now been taken into custody for her own safety along with the placard... we will find out her background, where she has come from and who are behind her among other things,"""" Rao told reporters, adding she did not raise any slogan. The """"Kashmir Mukti (liberation), Dalit Mukti, Muslim Mukti"""" slogans were written in both Kannada and English in the placard held by her. To a question if she would be arrested, the Commissioner said let the investigation be held. """"It is too early as she has just been taken into custody,"""" he added. Last evening, Amulya Leona had raised """"Pakistan Zindabad"""" slogan thrice in the presence of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi after the organisers of the event under the banner of """"Save Constitution"""" invited her to address the gathering, prompting him to denounce her act. After being removed from the stage, she was later arrested on charges of sedition and produced before a magistrate court which remanded her to 14 days judicial custody. An upset Owaisi had said he would not have participated in the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act had he known that the woman had been invited for the event and asserted his party had no links with her."

Organizers planned the worship service at Gas Works Park on Labor Day, but the city said it would shut the service down """"due to anticipated crowding that could impact the public health of residents,"""" over the coronavirus pandemic.  """"Seattle Parks and Recreation does not allow unpermitted public events to take place in Seattle parks and asks the public continue to adhere to current public health guidelines so that we can keep our parks open,"""" the city added. Sean Feucht Ministries condemned the decision and called out the city's hypocrisy on political rallies. """"This is the height of hypocrisy for the City of Seattle to turn a blind eye to riots, looting, and AntiFa, while refusing to let Christians gather in a public park to sing and worship,"""" said Feucht in a statement on Facebook. """"First the government shuts down churches. Now it's shutting down parks to stop us from worshipping. Time to stand up church!"""" he added. Hundreds of his supporters heeded the call and showed up on Monday to the """"protest worship"""" service. Feucht, a missionary and musician, led the event, and later posted a statement to his social media account. """"America was founded on the freedom to worship. Politicians can write press releases.

1,"Menu  SALT LAKE CITY √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù A protest against police brutality in downtown Salt Lake City Saturday has escalated, leading to response from SWAT teams and the National Guard. The demonstration was one of multiple protests planned in response to the death of George Floyd, who died Monday in police custody after video showed a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes as he struggled to breathe and went unconscious. Organizers also say they are demonstrating for 22-year-old Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal, who was shot and killed by Salt Lake City Police one week ago. The department is expected to release body camera footage within 10 days of the incident. The protest was intended by organizers to be peaceful, but it gradually escalated as the Salt Lake City Police Department headquarters building was vandalized with spray-painted messages, and an unoccupied SLCPD vehicle has been overturned, smashed and set on fire at 200 East and 400 South. A Utah Transit Authority TRAX station was also damaged. Gov. Gary Herbert released a statement on the incident: √¢‚Ç¨≈ìWe are in close contact with our department of public safety and receiving regular updates. Our hearts break for the family of George Floyd. We are grateful for the swift actions taken by the state of Minnesota to hold those responsible for his death accountable. We can not, however, condone violence, defacement of public buildings, and destruction of property. We call upon the good people of Utah to engage civilly and to act peaceably as they seek to exercise their first amendment rights.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù He later announced he will be calling in the National Guard.Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, news media, people traveling directly to and from work, traveling directly to and from the Airport, seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or those experiencing homelessness. Police have asked the public to avoid the Salt Lake metro area if possible. Many of the demonstrators have marched to the State Capitol, where Utah Highway Patrol are keeping anyone from going up the stairs leading to the building. SLCPD SWAT teams have now responded downtown along with agencies from surrounding areas. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has announced a curfew at 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday morning for the entire city. Mendenhall and SLCPD Chief Mike Brown said no one is allowed to be in public during that time even for traveling, but provided the following exceptions: Mendenhall and Brown held a press conference at 9 p.m. with an update on the curfew, asking the public to stay home and for protesters to go home. Brown also stated that six people had been arrested at the time. One officer was hit over the head with a baseball bat and is recovering in the hospital. Brown said if he had not been wearing a helmet, he would have likely been seriously injured or killed. About Us"

Protestors in Ladysmith KZN. Government vehicles set on fire. pic.twitter.com/fy69KbkHrJ Protests have been ongoing in Ladysmith since February, with incensed residents calling for the head of fraud and corruption accused Alfred Duma local municipality mayor Vincent Madlala, as well as bemoaning poor service delivery, water shortages and escalating violence between warring taxi associations. The Department of Social Development vehicles were torched on Wednesday evening, and although there is currently no leads on who the culprits are, eNCA report that evidence points to a petrol bomb attack. Roads going in and out of town have been barricaded with the carcasses of burnt-out trucks and minibus taxis that continue to enforce a total shutdown in the area. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala decried the loss of nearly R2 million a day with businesses, factories and transport operators rendered utterly unable to function amid the chaos. KZN MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for the perpetrators of the attack on the government vehicles to be swiftly brought to justice. ‚ÄúThe department has received a report and seen pictures with its six vehicles burnt by brazen criminals,‚Äù said Khoza. ‚ÄúWe are shocked at this despicable act of vandalism, which is totally abhorrent, destructive and beyond any justification whatsoever.‚Äù ‚ÄúThese vehicles are an important tool used to quickly respond and provide services to our needy communities,‚Äù she said. She said that the crime was just another in a long line of threatening acts committed against government employees in the area. ‚ÄúThe torching of our vehicles is another form of threatening employees who have suffered a lot of hijackings in the past.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe law must take its course wherever and whenever our properties are under threat. We urge police to investigate such criminal activities without fear or favour. No-one should do these despicable and morally reprehensible acts, despite any frustration,‚Äù she said.

1,"The Allahabad High Court ordered the hoardings to be removed. The Yogi Adityanath government's """"name and shame"""" campaign came to an abrupt halt today as the Allahabad High Court ordered that all posters and hoardings naming those accused of violence during protests against the controversial citizenship law be immediately removed. Citing the Right to Privacy as a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations as well as the Supreme Court, the judges said the government's move to display photographs and personal details of the accused on roadside hoardings was """"an unwarranted interference in privacy"""". The Lucknow administration has to give a compliance report on the removal to the registrar general by March 16, the court said. Sources said the hoardings ‚Äì in which the persons named were asked to pay for damage to public property and warned that their property would be attached otherwise -- were put up on instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The High Court had taken up issue on its own, asking the government to explain its position during a rare hearing on a Sunday, a court holiday. Senior advocate KK Rai, who attended the initial hearing at 10 am, said Chief Justice Govind Mathur had made some strong remarks on the issue, saying the government was """"impinging on privacy, respect and freedom"""" and called it an """"illegal move"""". Today, responding to the government's contention that the court """"erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction"""", the judges said, """"Courts are meant to impart justice and no court can shut its eyes if a public unjust is happening just before it"""". The judges said they were not concerned with """"validity of the compensation fastened, but to the act about disclosure of personal details of the accused persons"""". """"In the present case, the cause is not about personal injury caused to the persons whose personal details are given in the banner but the injury caused to the precious constitutional value and its shameless depiction by the administration. The cause as such is undemocratic functioning of government agencies which are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values,"""" the judgment read.  Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar, who was one of the people named in the hoardings, welcomed the judgment. Calling the government's move an effort to compromise the rule of law, she said the move of the court sets an example and """"reinforces our faith in the country's constitution"""". """"The damage is already done. This is a digital age. But this is a moral victory for us,"""" said Deepak Kabir, theater artist and another accused in the matter."
1,"A reporter became a police target as she covered the protests surrounding the killing of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd ... getting hit with pepper balls live on air. Protests erupted in cities across the country Friday night, including in Lousiville, Kentucky. Reporter Kaitlin Rust of WAVE was on the ground covering the events when a police officer intentionally opened fire on her and her camera operator, seemingly striking them both with pepper balls. Rust was certainly not in any type of disguise -- she was wearing a reflective vest, holding a microphone and not in a crowded group of people -- so it begs the question ... what the hell was the officer doing? Luckily, Rust appeared to be okay and continued to broadcast from the scene. As we reported ... a police car was set on fire in Atlanta and The White House placed on lockdown as protests continued Friday. Officer Derek Chauvin -- who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes while he died -- was arrested Friday and charged with 3rd-degree murder and 2nd-degree manslaughter. The other 3 officers involved have not yet been arrested or charged."

1,"It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. As the Delhi assembly elections draw to an end, Shaheen Bagh protesters seem to have vacated the protest site that they had occupied for almost 2 months now, blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares of the national capital in opposition to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act that intends to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. In the run up to the Delhi elections, there were speculations galore that the protest that had continued for more than 55 days, causing grave inconvenience to the lakhs of daily commuters will vanish just after the elections concluded. The speculations now appear to have turned true as a large number of regular protesters at Shaheen Bagh have deserted the protest site on Tuesday morning and did not turn up for what they claimed their democratic right to protest against the government‚Äôs move to bring in the CAA. Since December 15, 2019, protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh and blocked one of the arterial roads in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protest site was accused of being an independent enclave where participation of people was regulated based on their political inclinations and past predispositions. It also witnessed anti-India and pro-Azaadi slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. The Aam Admi Party is well poised to secure a thumping majority in the 70-seats Delhi assembly to stake a claim at the government while the BJP is expected to win 15-20 seats.

1,"Support weakening for Black Lives Matter, but still strong among Asian Americans and Blacks Black Lives Matter mural in Minneapolis in front of an Asian market. Photo by Adam Chau Support for the Black Lives Matter movement among Asian Americans remains strong, despite weakening nationwide. A new survey conducted this month by the Pew Research Center found more than two out of three, 69 percent of Asian Americans, say they support BLM compared to 55 percent of the country overall. The strongest backing comes from Blacks themselves with 87 percent, followed by Asian Americans and Hispanics with 66 percent. Just 45 percent of Whites embrace BLM, plummeting from 60 percent in June. Hispanic support dropped 11 percent from June. Asian American support dipped 6 percent. Support from Blacks remained stable, increasing 1 percent. The poll did not analyze why support has fallen, but a separate poll may provide an indicator. Awareness of news stories about clashes between police and protesters is significantly higher than awareness of other stories. Eight out of ten Americans surveyed by Pew say they‚Äôve heard a lot about violent protests, compared to 64 percent about mail in voting, 49 percent about cuts in the postal service and 40 percent about a stimulus bill. Republicans and Whites are most likely to believe coverage of protests over racial equality is too much. 39 percent of Asians say the news has given such protests the right amount of attention. 36 percent say its too much attention.

They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be coming from all over the state, driving to Salem first thing in the morning to protest the new Cap and Trade bill. The bill is aimed at reducing Oregon√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s carbon emissions, but loggers and other trade workers say the gas tax part of the bill will hit them especially hard. The group Timber Unity on Facebook has about 53,000 members. They believe Oregon can reduce carbon emissions without any new taxes. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll present their own plan to do that today. KXL√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Rosemary Reynolds is talking with truckers at the weigh station in North Plains and will have more on the story throughout the day. Check out these photos from Rosemary:  One couple on their way to Salem this morning is Dawn and her husband. They√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re longtime small business owners in East county and have never been politically active until now. Dawn tells KXL√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Jacob Dean they√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ll be volunteering, helping to setup in Salem later this morning. On the other side of the issue √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú some Rural Oregonians strongly support the Cap and Trade bill. Meghan Kemple is the Director of the Oregon Climate and Agriculture Network. She says over 250 stake holders like farmers and ranchers from across Oregon have signed a letter in support of the proposal. She tells KXL√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Mike Turner, significant changes have been made to the policy that will protect rural communities and address concerns. Like rising fuel costs will actually phase in over time. Meanwhile, a Republican lawmaker in Salem says Democrats are making another GOP walkout likely, because of amendments they added to a cap and trade bill. Senator Fred Girod tells the Statesman Journal the bill which would raise fuel prices to cap greenhouse gases, is even worse than the original, that led to a Republican walkout last year, which denied Democrats a vote on the bill. √Ç¬© 2021 Alpha Media LLC.All Rights Reserved."
1,"The BJP on Tuesday protested over the death of a Dalit man in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar district and alleged the Kamal Nath government in the state was adopting a policy of minority appeasement. Dhanprasad Ahirwar (24) was doused with kerosene in Dharmshri Colony, some 170 kilometres from here, on January 14 allegedly by four people who wanted him to take back a police complaint.

It was the government's duty to arrest the accused but it did not touch them because they belong to a minority community. The voice of a poor Dalit was not heard,"""" Chouhan alleged. He said crimes against Dalits were rising in MP under the Kamal Nath dispensation and the party's high command, comprising Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi would have to answer. He asked if the Gandhi family would come to Sagar to meet the kin of the deceased. State BJP chief Rakesh Singh said Ahirwar had approached police three times claiming that his life was in danger but the police did nothing. He said the state government should give Rs 25 lakh as compensation to Ahirwar's family as well as a job..

1,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since  Former Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang rallied Asian Americans to vote against Donald Trump in what he said could be a political gamechanger for the often overlooked community. ""If we get out in force and help Joe and Kamala win, this could be the major political awakening that Asian Americans have been waiting for a generation or more,"" Yang said Monday night in a virtual fundraiser for Asian Americans Against Trump. Yang was joined by prominent Asian American leaders and public figures, including Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna and Grace Meng, Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim, Pachinko author Min Jin Lee. The American entrepreneur said Asian Americans have been ""forced to become more engaged"" politically as they continue to suffer attacks from the ""hostility"" targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) community during the coronavirus pandemic. Many Asian Americans have been vulnerable to racist attacks, as President Donald Trump has used misleading and racist terms to describe the virus which experts said exacerbates microaggressions targeting the AAPI community. Yang said engaging with politics is a ""non-choice"" and an obligation for AAPI voters. ""We have to roll our sleeves up and do things we have not done as a community as high of a level as, frankly, people in other communities,"" Yang said. ""Our community can be the margin of victory and help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, our first Asian-American and Black woman vice president,"" NY Rep. Meng said. Asian American voters are the fastest-growing voting bloc with over 11 million eligible voters. California Rep. Khanna warned that ""anyone who thinks this election is not going to be very close, [is] underestimating Donald Trump's power to do everything possible to win. He's frankly mobilizing the power of the US government on behalf of his campaign"" and told Asian American voters that ""the only way we overcome that is by a massive turnout."" But to mobilize Asian American voters, the AAPI community must actively dispel the model minority myth, which is ""used by leaders to either be a wedge against other people of color or they are being used as some sort of pestilence,"" Lee said. Stereotyping Asian Americans as educated and hard-working, the model minority myth limits Asian Americans as people who are perfectly suited to be led, but not necessarily lead themselves. At the same time, the model minority myth does not capture the challenges that Asian Americans face and paints them under a monolithic narrative that is used as a wedge to pit them against other minorities. ""We still are in that place where we are expected to be the model minority, we are expected to be the ones who work hard, do really great work but never be the leaders,"" Kim said. ""If we can get the message out to other Asian Americans to have a say and a stake in the country where we live √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù we will be much more respected, much more powerful, and much more considered when it comes to the politics of our country."""
1,"President Trump√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s massive campaign rallies led to more than 30,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, and likely caused the death of 700 Americans, a new study says. The Stanford University paper took a close look at 18 Trump rallies between June and September and followed subjects √¢‚Ç¨≈ìup to ten post-rally weeks for each event.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThe communities in which Trump rallies took place paid a high price in terms of disease and death,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù researchers concluded in the paper released Friday.. Rates of COVID-19 often rose notably in communities that hosted the events, compared to nearby towns where Trump stayed away, the study found. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìThere are some indications that compliance with public health guidelines, such as the use of masks, improved at later rallies,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù researchers wrote. Researchers need more data to study whether better compliance with public health guidelines prevented sickness and saved lives requires more data, the Stanford paper said. The Trump campaign has insisted that it offers participants masks and temperature checks at the president√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s rallies.

1,"Led Zeppelin‚Äòs Robert Plant has canceled an upcoming G! Festival appearance in protest of an annual whaling practice known as grindadr√°p (the ‚ÄúGrind‚Äù). G! Festival, is a yearly event held at the seaside village of G√∏ta on the Danish archipelago of the Faroe Islands. Coinciding with the festival the Grind sees over a thousand pilot whales and dolphins driven to the shores of local beaches and slaughtered by island residents. While the Grind is a thousand-year-old tradition, the manner in which it is conducted is considered by animal rights activists as appallingly cruel. ‚ÄúWhen whalers locate the whale pods,‚Äù local Rannv√° Johansen has shared of the event to BluePlanetSociety.org, ‚Äúthey are driven ashore, [which can take] a very long time. The whales then get stressed and the entire whale family can see each other being killed and hear screaming from their babies. They can only wait for themselves to feel the knife.‚Äù Plant was set to perform at the festival on July 18th, However, G! Festival has now announced via its official website that the Led Zeppelin vocalist and new backing outfit Saving Grace will no longer appear after having the cull brought to their attention by environmental advocacy group Blue Planet Society. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre disappointed and annoyed with the cancelation,‚Äù G! Festival‚Äôs managing director Sigv√∏r Laks√° has shared via the events official website, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been excited and happy with the massive interest and the positive reception to the announcement of Saving Grace, especially the Robert Plant fever that naturally comes with it.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt seems somewhat unprofessional for these acts to pull out of a booking without any prior notice or attempt at constructive dialogue which might have allowed us to address the artist‚Äôs concerns,‚Äù Laks√° continues, ‚ÄúIt also appears contradictory when an artist is happy to play in countries like Norway and Iceland [which carry out commercial whaling], which Mr. Plant has done in the past, even in 2019.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is a severe blow for the festival,‚Äù Sigv√∏r concludes, ‚Äúwhich forces us to rethink our approach in producing the G! Festival.‚Äù Plant, who has not publicly commented on the cancellation, is not the first major act to cancel an appearance at the festival after having the cull brought to their attention. Pop singer Lewis Capaldi and American rapper Princess Nokia have also declined to appear at the festival in wake of the information coming to light.

1,"A bill proposing compensation to African descendants of slaves has passed the California Assembly. The bill has passed the California Assembly on Thursday, with a 56-5 vote. The bill was already in play, but advanced most likely due to recent protesting and rioting these past 2 weeks after George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and a number of African Americans were murdered by police and white vigilantes. The bill still needs to pass the Senate, and be signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. If the bill passes 8 people with backgrounds in racial justice reform will lead a study and determine who would be eligible for compensation and how it would be rewarded. Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, a Democrat from San Diego who wrote the bill, and who also leads the Legislative Black Caucus, said the study will be including the fact that California participated in slavery, even as it joined the union as a ‚ÄúFree state‚Äù in 1850. Weber stated: ‚ÄúThe discriminatory practices of the past echo into the everyday lives of today‚Äôs Californians,‚Äù The panel conducting the study will start meeting no later than June 2021.

1,"As social distancing and lockdown measures are extended in many countries, people are starting to get frustrated. In some instances ‚Äì instead of staying inside, or writing to their representatives ‚Äì people are starting to defy lockdown and hold physical protests. Fox News hosts are among those encouraging people to carry out physical protests against stay-at-home orders, potentially endangering the lives of countless others. In Michigan, a mass protest was organised in defiance of the governor‚Äôs stay-at-home orders. Recent figures put the number of deaths in Michigan at 1,900. Laura Ingraham, a prominent host on FOX news, tweeted in approval and suggested that the same may start to happen in other states. Initially, protesters were supposed to create traffic gridlock and hold signs from their cars, but a group gathered on the steps of Michigan‚Äôs city hall. They said that the damage caused by the economic impact of stay-at-home orders was greater than the damage caused by Covid-19. Other Fox News hosts, such as Jeanine Pirro, expressed similar sentiments on TV, saying that health officials had """"overblown sentiments"""" and that the American spirit would not ‚Äòtake it‚Äô. She also said that what had happened in Lansing, Michigan, would start to happen all over the country. On the Fox news website, coverage of protests featured prominently. Ingraham, Pirro and a number of other Fox News hosts were calling for stricter lockdown measures and more guidance from central government towards the end of March, although they appear to have changed their mind after a few weeks. There‚Äôs little evidence to suggest that any states in the US have reached a peak in Covid-19 cases. Other prominent personalities in right-wing media have expressed frustration at public health measures ‚Äì pro-Trump commentator Candace Owens tweeted in anger after being asked to wear a mask in a supermarket (she also said that she had been going every day). Similar protests have taken place in Vancouver, Canada, where a small group of people gathered to protest what they saw as government overreach, and were promptly fined or arrested.

1,"A Florida teacher responded to her district‚Äôs plans to reopen for in-person classes during the coronavirus pandemic by writing her own obituary. Whitney Reddick, who teaches special education in Jacksonville, Florida, posted the mock death notice to Facebook Aug. 4. In it, she proclaims that she died ‚Äúwhile alone in isolation and on a ventilator at a Duval county hospital‚Äù last week at age 33. ‚ÄúEven though she shouted from the rooftops, attempted to be unemotional, and educated herself in facts and science, she succumbed to the ignorance of those in power,‚Äù the obituary reads. ‚ÄúShe returned to work, did her best to handle all the roles placed on her shoulders; educator, COVID-security guard, human shield, firefighter, social worker, nurse, and caregiver but the workload weakened her, and the virus took hold.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhitney was taken from us,‚Äù it continues. ‚ÄúYes, of course too soon, but we are the ones left with holes in our hearts, missing how big hers was.‚Äù Mourners are then encouraged to send ‚Äúcondolences‚Äù to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) and the Duval County school board and superintendent. According to its website, Duval County public schools are slated to reopen next Thursday with both in-person and remote learning options for students. Though Reddick said in an interview she‚Äôll return to her classroom as scheduled, she added that she‚Äôd prefer her district keep classes for all students remote, given that coronavirus cases in Florida continue to surge. ‚ÄúI felt the gravity of the situation and the obit took that on,‚Äù she told ‚ÄúThe Today Show‚Äù last week. She said that in the debate over reopening schools, educators ‚Äúno longer became people who had families and loved ones, we became a tool in restarting an economy. I wanted it to hit home that teachers are people and have families and loved ones.‚Äù And Reddick, the mother of a 1-year-old boy, said she‚Äôs mostly concerned about what would happen to her family if she were to contract COVID-19. ‚ÄúI love my job so much,‚Äù she told CBS Jacksonville. ‚ÄúWhat if I go on a ventilator? What if my husband gets sick? ... Who takes care of our son? What if I pass away? What if he passes away?‚Äù In an email, Duval County Superintendent Diana Greene told HuffPost she and her staff planned to ‚Äúrise to the challenge‚Äù of teaching amid the pandemic. ‚ÄúTeaching is a public service, but it is unlikely any of us thought about a long-term global pandemic when we chose this path to serve children,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI empathize with the fears some teachers have expressed, and I also empathize with the needs of 130,000 children and their families.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith the resources and guidance available to us, we must move forward with every feasible precaution to support our employees and to serve those students who need us in classrooms,‚Äù she added.

More than 50 people were arrested overnight, including at least two who were clad in body armor. One individual was armed with a dagger while another had a knife, police said. The names of those arrested and their charges were not immediately released. Video posted on social media shows what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being thrown into the middle of crowd and exploding into flames on a residential street. One person's legs appears to catch fire as they run away. The video shows police in riot gear using flash-bang grenades while making loudspeaker announcements, ordering people to disperse the area. Some demonstrators are seen setting off fireworks in the street as police advance. A sergeant was struck by a commercial-grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Several other law enforcement officers were hit by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders and feet, with only their protective gear preventing serious injury, police said. Meanwhile, an Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents. The Portland Police Bureau said ""it was clear that the intent of the crowd was not peaceful protest,"" as many people were carrying large shields and were dressed in protective gear, including helmets, gas masks and body armor. The unrest in Oregon's largest city erupted following the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck as three other officers watched. Protests in cities across the United States and around the world are calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice. Many of the recent demonstrations in Portland have ended in arson, vandalism and violence. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested by authorities there since late May, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-seven people were arrested following a march Friday night, according to police, who accused protesters of throwing rocks at officers and chanting ""burn it down"" outside the offices of the Portland Police Association. Last weekend, a pro-Trump supporter was shot to death during dueling demonstrations in downtown Portland. The suspected gunman was killed during an encounter with authorities Thursday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
1,"It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. As the Delhi assembly elections draw to an end, Shaheen Bagh protesters seem to have vacated the protest site that they had occupied for almost 2 months now, blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares of the national capital in opposition to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act that intends to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. In the run up to the Delhi elections, there were speculations galore that the protest that had continued for more than 55 days, causing grave inconvenience to the lakhs of daily commuters will vanish just after the elections concluded. The speculations now appear to have turned true as a large number of regular protesters at Shaheen Bagh have deserted the protest site on Tuesday morning and did not turn up for what they claimed their democratic right to protest against the government√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s move to bring in the CAA. Since December 15, 2019, protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh and blocked one of the arterial roads in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protest site was accused of being an independent enclave where participation of people was regulated based on their political inclinations and past predispositions. It also witnessed anti-India and pro-Azaadi slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. The Aam Admi Party is well poised to secure a thumping majority in the 70-seats Delhi assembly to stake a claim at the government while the BJP is expected to win 15-20 seats. The Congress party, on the other hand, seems to be on its way to acquire another duck. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The Patiala House Courts later sent Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia alumni president who was arrested on Sunday, to 10-day police custody. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìFrom the interrogation of witnesses, it is revealed that accused Shifa Ur Rehman received funds from members of alumni association of Jamia Millia Islamia based in Middle East countries and he was co-coordinating at the protest sites,"" the Delhi police said in its application demanding custody of Rahman. Police said Rahman's name had popped up during the questioning of Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Meeran Haider, Safora Zargar, Gulfisa, Tahir Hussain, and three members of the Popular Front of India (PFI). ""Shifa-Ul-Rehman is also found actively involved in a conspiracy hatched in setting up anti CAA/NPR/NRC protests at various sites in Delhi, giving hate speeches that led to the riots in February 2020 at various protest sites, i.e., Jamia Nagar, Shaheen Bagh, Seelampur, Khureji, Inderlok and Hauz Rani,"" it said. According to police, Rehman along with AAJMI members namely Areeb and Badre Alam and other members of Jamia Co-ordination Committee (JCC), had visited various protest sites in Delhi. The Delhi police told the court that during the investigation, names of some more suspects have come out and the accused should be questioned at length about those suspects to obtain their exact particulars. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìHuge money was also funded as well as spent by the conspirators to carry out these riots in Delhi,"" the police said, adding that the custodial interrogation of Rahman is required to confront him with huge technical data and other evidence collected during investigation. At least 53 people died in Delhi in February as those opposing and favouring the new citizenship law clashed each other, leaving a trail of destruction in several areas of the national capital.

A feminist collective performed a Bengali version of the Chilean feminist performance piece, ‚ÄúThe Rapist is You‚Äù in Kolkata on Saturday as part of the widespread protests against Narendra Modi‚Äôs visit to the city. Titled Un violador en tu camino in Spanish, it was composed by a Chilean feminist collective and performed in Santiago in 2019, against the backdrop of widespread anti-government protests. Since then, the song has gone viral, inspiring women around the world to generate their own versions. In Kolkata, it was translated into Bengali and named Dhorshok Tumii. A group of women connected over social media decided to perform it. After a fortnight of rehearsals, mostly in Jadavpur University, the collective performed it for the first time on January 4, outside the city‚Äôs iconic New Market. When it was learnt that Modi was going to come to Kolkata, the collective decided to repeat their performance. ‚ÄúWe wanted to highlight the patriarchal violence that Modi‚Äôs idea of a Hindu Rashtra represents,‚Äù said Aopala Banerjee, one of the women who had performed the anthem on Saturday told Scroll.in.

Tim Walz wrote to President Trump requesting federal aid to repair widespread damage in Minneapolis and St. Paul from the fiery George Floyd protests, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rebuffed the request for a financial helping hand. The state has estimated total damages at more than $500 million, and Walz specifically wrote in his July 2 letter that $15 million in cleanup and repair costs could be eligible for federal reimbursement. ‚ÄúThe governor is disappointed that the federal government declined his request for financial support ... to help Minnesota rebuild after civil unrest damaged public infrastructure and caused extensive fire damage in the wake of George Floyd‚Äôs death,‚Äù spokesman Teddy Tschann said in a statement. ‚ÄúAs we navigate one of the most difficult periods in our state‚Äôs history, we look for support from our federal government to help us through,‚Äù he said. Hundreds of buildings in the Twin Cities were destroyed by fires, looted or damaged during the nightly protests following Floyd‚Äôs May 25 death beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis cop. A local police precinct was among the structures torched during the demonstrations. Walz noted in his letter that it was ‚Äúthe second most destructive incident of civil unrest in United States history after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.‚Äù The governor noted the state budget was further crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an anticipated $1.5 billion surplus morphing into a projected deficit of $2.4 billion. FEMA, in a statement provided to Minnesota Public Radio, said the turndown came after a ‚Äúthorough review‚Äù of the state‚Äôs request for the funds as a major disaster area. ‚ÄúIt was determined that the impact to public infrastructure is within the capabilities of the local and state governments to recover from,‚Äù the statement concluded. Minnesota officials now have 30 days to appeal the federal rejection, with the governor‚Äôs spokesman saying his office was ‚Äúexploring more options‚Äù to resolve its dire financial situation."

Trump """"chose to speak about me at every single rally, didn't really matter where he was, sometimes multiple times in a day, as he held his Klan rallies across the country,"""" Omar said to Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart. Omar, a member of the far-left group of House Democrats known as """"the Squad,"""" reflected on ousting President Trump and what she perceived as """"a four-year assault"""" on refugees and immigrants like her. She also discussed infighting between moderate and leftist Democrats, sparked by the party's lackluster House and Senate election results. Omar said in the interview that the rift within the Democratic Party """"isn't as strong as it's being made out to be,"""" despite House Democrats' chaotic post-election phone call. During the call, Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who was first elected to the House alongside Omar in 2018, blamed leftists' radical anti-police and socialist messaging for her near-loss in this election. Throughout the Trump presidency, """"the Squad"""" and other progressive Democrats have likened President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists and white supremacists. Omar also compared the president's rallies to Klan rallies in a tweet last year. Rep.

As areas of Minneapolis shifted from peaceful protest against the death of George Floyd to looting, arson, and vandalism on Wednesday and Thursday night, the King Center √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù founded by Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow to promote MLK Jr.'s ""nonviolent philosophy and methodology"" √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù posted this excerpt from King's 1967 ""The Other America"" speech at Stanford University. Speaking two years after California's Watts riots in August 1965 and race riots in Harlem the previous summer, King spent a few minutes trying to explain the cause of rioting to his predominantly white audience. √¢‚Ç¨≈ìIn the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?√¢‚Ç¨¬ù pic.twitter.com/Als3jhxaGH America has consistently ""taken a positive step forward on the question of racial justice and racial equality"" only to follow it with ""certain backward steps,"" King said. Because of widespread and widely ignored black poverty and racial injustice, ""all of our cities are potentially powder kegs,"" he added, and ""many in moments of anger, many in moments of deep bitterness engage in riots."" King continued: Let me say as I've always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. ... But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.
