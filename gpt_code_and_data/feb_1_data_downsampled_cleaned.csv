1," A feminist collective performed a Bengali version of the Chilean feminist performance piece, The Rapist is Youin Kolkata on Saturday as part of the widespread protests against Narendra Modi's visit to the city. Titled Un violador en tu camino in Spanish, it was composed by a Chilean feminist collective and performed in Santiago in 2019, against the backdrop of widespread anti-government protests. Since then, the song has gone viral, inspiring women around the world to generate their own versions. In Kolkata, it was translated into Bengali and named Dhorshok Tumii. A group of women connected over social media decided to perform it. After a fortnight of rehearsals, mostly in Jadavpur University, the collective performed it for the first time on January 4, outside the city's iconic New Market. When it was learnt that Modi was going to come to Kolkata, the collective decided to repeat their performance. We wanted to highlight the patriarchal violence that Modi's idea of a Hindu Rashtra represents,said Aopala Banerjee, one of the women who had performed the anthem on Saturday told Scroll.in. The chant was also heard at a flash mob of women outside the courthouse where Harvey Weinstein is going to be tried for sexual abuse.

1,"It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. As the Delhi assembly elections draw to an end, Shaheen Bagh protesters seem to have vacated the protest site that they had occupied for almost 2 months now, blocking one of the busiest thoroughfares of the national capital in opposition to the enactment of the Citizenship Amendment Act that intends to grant citizenship to persecuted minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. On Tuesday morning, incidentally, when the Delhi Assembly election results were to be announced, the protest site of Shaheen Bagh appeared empty with scarce number of demonstrators at the site, says a report published in Amar Ujala. In the run up to the Delhi elections, there were speculations galore that the protest that had continued for more than 55 days, causing grave inconvenience to the lakhs of daily commuters will vanish just after the elections concluded. The speculations now appear to have turned true as a large number of regular protesters at Shaheen Bagh have deserted the protest site on Tuesday morning and did not turn up for what they claimed their democratic right to protest against the government's move to bring in the CAA. Since December 15, 2019, protesters gathered at Shaheen Bagh and blocked one of the arterial roads in Delhi against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The protest site was accused of being an independent enclave where participation of people was regulated based on their political inclinations and past predispositions. It also witnessed anti-India and pro-Azaadi slogans being chanted by the demonstrators. It is noteworthy to mention that Shaheen Bagh comes under Okhla constituency where controversial Aam Aadmi Party member Amanatullah Khan has registered a victory. The Aam Admi Party is well poised to secure a thumping majority in the 70-seats Delhi assembly to stake a claim at the government while the BJP is expected to win 15-20 seats. The Congress party, on the other hand, seems to be on its way to acquire another duck. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

They'll be coming from all over the state, driving to Salem first thing in the morning to protest the new Cap and Trade bill. The bill is aimed at reducing Oregon's carbon emissions, but loggers and other trade workers say the gas tax part of the bill will hit them especially hard. The group Timber Unity on Facebook has about 53,000 members. They believe Oregon can reduce carbon emissions without any new taxes. They'll present their own plan to do that today. KXL's Rosemary Reynolds is talking with truckers at the weigh station in North Plains and will have more on the story throughout the day. Check out these photos from Rosemary:  One couple on their way to Salem this morning is Dawn and her husband. They're longtime small business owners in East county and have never been politically active until now. Dawn tells KXL's Jacob Dean they'll be volunteering, helping to setup in Salem later this morning. On the other side of the issue some Rural Oregonians strongly support the Cap and Trade bill. Meghan Kemple is the Director of the Oregon Climate and Agriculture Network. She says over 250 stake holders like farmers and ranchers from across Oregon have signed a letter in support of the proposal. She tells KXL's Mike Turner, significant changes have been made to the policy that will protect rural communities and address concerns. Like rising fuel costs will actually phase in over time. Meanwhile, a Republican lawmaker in Salem says Democrats are making another GOP walkout likely, because of amendments they added to a cap and trade bill. Senator Fred Girod tells the Statesman Journal the bill which would raise fuel prices to cap greenhouse gases, is even worse than the original, that led to a Republican walkout last year, which denied Democrats a vote on the bill.","Salem, Ore.

Around 200,000 teachers and education workers, across 72 school boards, affecting 5,000 schools are protesting. The strike has been ongoing for over a month, with the primary concerns for teachers being increased classroom size, expansion to online learning, funding cuts to special education, hiring teachers with seniority, and improved salary compensation. While union leaders are continuing to organize further disruption, our government remains focused on getting deals that ensure students are learning each and every day,Stephen Lecce said, Minister to Education said in a statement ahead of Friday's strike.

1," Led Zeppelins Robert Plant has canceled an upcoming G! Festival appearance in protest of an annual whaling practice known as grindadrÃ¡p (the Grind). G! Festival, is a yearly event held at the seaside village of GÃ¸ta on the Danish archipelago of the Faroe Islands. Coinciding with the festival the Grind sees over a thousand pilot whales and dolphins driven to the shores of local beaches and slaughtered by island residents. While the Grind is a thousand-year-old tradition, the manner in which it is conducted is considered by animal rights activists as appallingly cruel. When whalers locate the whale pods,local RannvÃ¡ Johansen has shared of the event to BluePlanetSociety.org, they are driven ashore, [which can take] a very long time. The whales then get stressed and the entire whale family can see each other being killed and hear screaming from their babies. They can only wait for themselves to feel the knife.Plant was set to perform at the festival on July 18th, However, G! Festival has now announced via its official website that the Led Zeppelin vocalist and new backing outfit Saving Grace will no longer appear after having the cull brought to their attention by environmental advocacy group Blue Planet Society. We're disappointed and annoyed with the cancelation,G! Festival's managing director SigvÃ¸r LaksÃ¡ has shared via the events official website, We've been excited and happy with the massive interest and the positive reception to the announcement of Saving Grace, especially the Robert Plant fever that naturally comes with it.It seems somewhat unprofessional for these acts to pull out of a booking without any prior notice or attempt at constructive dialogue which might have allowed us to address the artist's concerns,LaksÃ¡ continues, It also appears contradictory when an artist is happy to play in countries like Norway and Iceland [which carry out commercial whaling], which Mr. Plant has done in the past, even in 2019.This is a severe blow for the festival,SigvÃ¸r concludes, which forces us to rethink our approach in producing the G! Festival.Plant, who has not publicly commented on the cancellation, is not the first major act to cancel an appearance at the festival after having the cull brought to their attention. Pop singer Lewis Capaldi and American rapper Princess Nokia have also declined to appear at the festival in wake of the information coming to light.

1,"The Allahabad High Court ordered the hoardings to be removed. The Yogi Adityanath government's ""name and shame"" campaign came to an abrupt halt today as the Allahabad High Court ordered that all posters and hoardings naming those accused of violence during protests against the controversial citizenship law be immediately removed. Citing the Right to Privacy as a fundamental human right recognised by the United Nations as well as the Supreme Court, the judges said the government's move to display photographs and personal details of the accused on roadside hoardings was ""an unwarranted interference in privacy"". The Lucknow administration has to give a compliance report on the removal to the registrar general by March 16, the court said. Sources said the hoardings in which the persons named were asked to pay for damage to public property and warned that their property would be attached otherwise -- were put up on instructions of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The High Court had taken up issue on its own, asking the government to explain its position during a rare hearing on a Sunday, a court holiday. Senior advocate KK Rai, who attended the initial hearing at 10 am, said Chief Justice Govind Mathur had made some strong remarks on the issue, saying the government was ""impinging on privacy, respect and freedom"" and called it an ""illegal move"". Today, responding to the government's contention that the court ""erred in invoking public interest jurisdiction"", the judges said, ""Courts are meant to impart justice and no court can shut its eyes if a public unjust is happening just before it"". The judges said they were not concerned with ""validity of the compensation fastened, but to the act about disclosure of personal details of the accused persons"". ""In the present case, the cause is not about personal injury caused to the persons whose personal details are given in the banner but the injury caused to the precious constitutional value and its shameless depiction by the administration. The cause as such is undemocratic functioning of government agencies which are supposed to treat all members of public with respect and courtesy and at all time should behave in manner that upholds constitutional and democratic values,"" the judgment read.  Activist-politician Sadaf Jafar, who was one of the people named in the hoardings, welcomed the judgment. Calling the government's move an effort to compromise the rule of law, she said the move of the court sets an example and ""reinforces our faith in the country's constitution"". ""The damage is already done. This is a digital age. But this is a moral victory for us,"" said Deepak Kabir, theater artist and another accused in the matter.

1,"A pair of Utah men are behind bars after police found numerous weapons and social media posts threatening violence against officers. Authorities in West Valley, Utah say 27-year olds Yuri Silva and Christian Hernandez were pulled over on their way to a protest in Salt Lake City, and cops found several firearms in their vehicle, including what the Deseret News describes as an Uzi with a suppressor. In the home of Yuri Neves Silva, 27, of West Valley City, more weapons were found and seized. Information about a potential motive was not immediately available, but police believe the two were headed to the protests to cause trouble. We had every reason to believe that's what they intended to do,Vainuku said. Silva had posted multiple threats of violence against police, specifically Salt Lake City police and West Valley City policeover social media and encouraged others to take up arms against police as well, and had reportedly listed the names and addresses of specific officers to be targeted,she said. Silva was arrested for investigation of making a terroristic threat. Police say Silva was making multiple posts about harming police officers and was seen in one picture holding a gun, according to a police affidavit. Silva's not a prohibited person, but the same can't be said for his buddy. Christian Hernandez is now facing felon in possession and drug charges after marijuana was found in the vehicle along with the firearms. As for Silva's alleged threats, they seem to be pretty specific in their intent. In one video posted on (Sunday), the suspect made a video showing himself mocking the Salt Lake City curfew, stating, Hands up don't shoot,'while also threatening to kill police officers, the affidavit states. The suspect also made comments knowing officers were trying to follow his Facebook page and he directed officers to stay at home to protect their families, otherwise we will have no choice but to affiliate you with your  colleagues and their actions.' The suspect also mentions a police officer who resides in his neighborhood and comments, You put that cop car in the garage real quick play boi,'according to the affidavit. According to police, Silva denies that he had any actual intent to harm police officers, but admitted that he hoped his social media posts would incite others to violence. That excuse may have been more believable if Silva and Hernandez hadn't had multiple firearms with them on their way to what was supposed to be a peaceful protest. Thankfully, things seem to be calming down in Salt Lake City after a weekend of violence. Protests on Tuesday were loud but lawful for the most part. One person was arrested at the state capitol after protests continued long past the curfew imposed by the mayor, but that was it. If Silva and Hernandez hadn't been apprehended, however, who knows how bad things would have gotten. The legitimate protesters may have issues with police, but they should be praising officers for their actions in thwarting what very well could have turned a peaceful protest into a bloodbath.

Laura Ingraham, a prominent host on FOX news, tweeted in approval and suggested that the same may start to happen in other states. Initially, protesters were supposed to create traffic gridlock and hold signs from their cars, but a group gathered on the steps of Michigan's city hall. They said that the damage caused by the economic impact of stay-at-home orders was greater than the damage caused by Covid-19. Other Fox News hosts, such as Jeanine Pirro, expressed similar sentiments on TV, saying that health officials had ""overblown sentiments"" and that the American spirit would not take it'. She also said that what had happened in Lansing, Michigan, would start to happen all over the country. On the Fox news website, coverage of protests featured prominently. Ingraham, Pirro and a number of other Fox News hosts were calling for stricter lockdown measures and more guidance from central government towards the end of March, although they appear to have changed their mind after a few weeks. There's little evidence to suggest that any states in the US have reached a peak in Covid-19 cases.

The demonstration was one of multiple protests planned in response to the death of George Floyd, who died Monday in police custody after video showed a Minneapolis, Minnesota police officer kneeling on his neck for several minutes as he struggled to breathe and went unconscious. Organizers also say they are demonstrating for 22-year-old Bernardo Palacios-Carbajal, who was shot and killed by Salt Lake City Police one week ago. The department is expected to release body camera footage within 10 days of the incident. The protest was intended by organizers to be peaceful, but it gradually escalated as the Salt Lake City Police Department headquarters building was vandalized with spray-painted messages, and an unoccupied SLCPD vehicle has been overturned, smashed and set on fire at 200 East and 400 South. A Utah Transit Authority TRAX station was also damaged. Gov. Gary Herbert released a statement on the incident: We are in close contact with our department of public safety and receiving regular updates. Our hearts break for the family of George Floyd. We are grateful for the swift actions taken by the state of Minnesota to hold those responsible for his death accountable.

SLCPD SWAT teams have now responded downtown along with agencies from surrounding areas. Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall has announced a curfew at 8 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday morning for the entire city. Mendenhall and SLCPD Chief Mike Brown said no one is allowed to be in public during that time even for traveling, but provided the following exceptions: Mendenhall and Brown held a press conference at 9 p.m. with an update on the curfew, asking the public to stay home and for protesters to go home. Brown also stated that six people had been arrested at the time. One officer was hit over the head with a baseball bat and is recovering in the hospital.

The 26-year-old said he did nothing to provoke being shot with a non-lethal sponge round, but as a result, attorneys say, he lost his left eye, CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports. ""It is ironic that a protest about excessive use of force and police brutality ends with excessive use of force and police brutality,"" said Jesuorobo Enobakhare, who chairs the Dallas Police Oversight Board. Protesters have called for the Police Oversight Board to resume regular meetings that stopped during the coronavirus shutdowns. Next week it will. On its agenda will be votes on whether to investigate how the Dallas Police Department handles protests, as well as an incident that happened Monday night when hundreds of protesters walked onto the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge. CBS DFW said it heard bangs and saw smoke, and saw a protester being carried away. ""She was flash-banged by police officers for walking peacefully,"" said the person helping her from the scene. Dallas Police Oversight monitor Tonya McClary, who reports to the board, said her office has seen a surge in complaints in the last two days. ""Our voicemail is almost full. We're still going through emails. What we've been able to get through right now is about 100,"" she said. Some cases, like Saenz's, have been fast-tracked and are already under investigation. McClary said some complaints against officers may be tossed out. Others could lead to discipline. The most serious cases could result in criminal investigations of officers involved. She said her office will independently review the department's decisions and, if it disagrees with any, can launch its own investigation. She and the board will also be able to look at the bigger picture and recommend any policy changes for the Dallas Police Department as a whole.

We got their plans, manuals, intercepted internal communications, and have recordings of their zoom chats. What you are about to see is part of a two year undercover investigation into the leftist radicalization imbedded within the climate justice movement that contributed to the riots in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In this first video, we are going to show how the Sunrise Movement played a preemptive role in carrying out the mayhem, taking advantage of George Floyd's death and using it as a trigger point, to further push their Green New Deal agenda and promoting the abolition of the police. We didn't expect to find organizers radicalizing middle school and high school children teaching them military tactics and preparation for high risk actions. Some of these tactics include escalation provocation techniques, blocking freeway traffic, and how to get arrested bogging-down law enforcement in the name of destroying capitalism to make way for the Green New Deal. What some parents may have though were innocent youth organizations genuinely fostered and ran by children are actually top-down monolithic structures with private intelligence, military contractors, and foreign interests influencing children to carry out their subversive objectives. The events that erupted in Minneapolis, Minnesota were not a spontaneous reaction to the murder of George Floyd. These were well planned events anticipating some perfect trigger point to bring about the new normal- a world without police, without borders, without industry, without wealth, without private property, without an economy - a world based on communist ideals imbedded within the Green New Deal. The Green New Deal is not about climate change, it is about climate justice - a radical new ideology hellbent on destroying western civilization under the false pretense that white supremacy is the leading cause of climate change, social injustice and all problems globally. The organizers of these Youth Non-government Organizations, or Youngos, embellish white supremacy as a systemic problem, hyper-focusing on statistically rare instances of racial inequality and injustice, while ignoring great strides of progress the United States has made over the past century towards equal opportunity and criminal justice reform. However, in order to normalize radical policies put forth by the Green New Deal, crises have to be capitalized on to further their agenda while destroying the great accomplishments of civil rights movements of the past.

1,"Democratic Senators have blocked a Republican police reform bill, leaving the legislation dead on the floor of Congress and likely defeating any Federal attempt to address police reform as a whole. The bill failed before its text ever made it to the floor. Democrats were able to marshal their caucus to defeat a vote designed to bring the issue to the floor for debate and killed the bill 55-45. A total of 60 votes would have been necessary to move the bill forward. Republicans had 53 votes, but not enough Democrats joined them,Fox News reports. Only Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), Sen. Doug Jones (D-AL), and Sen. Angus King (I-ME) crossed partisan lines. Democrats fought the Republican bill, led by Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), which they said did not go far enough in addressing critical issues at the crux of police reform. The bill did not ban the use of chokeholds outright, preferring instead to warn departments to craft their own policies against the practice or risk losing federal funds. The bill also shied away from outlawing so-called no-knockwarrants, preferring instead to establish a national database to track those warrants' use and abuse. The House of Representatives, led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), has its own bill which the Democratic caucus plans to bring to the floor there on Thursday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) was apoplectic about the situation in an interview that took place just after the procedural vote failed. The Senate was supposed to officially take up police reform on the floor today. Instead, our Democratic colleagues are poised to turn this routine step into a partisan impasse,he told reporters, adding that the bill could have been the subject of debate and compromise, but Democrats refused to come to the bargaining table. McConnell called Democrats' strategy in proposing the bill bizarre,particularly given that they refused to even agree to debate the measure. They don't want a debate, they don't want amendments, they'll filibuster police reform from even reaching the floor of the Senate unless the majority lets the minority rewrite the bill behind closed doors in advance,McConnell said. The lead up to Wednesday's vote has been acrimonious, sometimes to a shocking degree. Speaking late Tuesday, Pelosi accused Republicans, including Scott the first black man to serve in both the House and Senate of trying to get away with murder, actually the murder of George Floyd.When pressed on the fact that her statement could be considered racially charged, Pelosi refused to apologize. On Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) attacked McConnell directly, warning the ranking Republican that he did not have Civil Rights leaderson his side. Since it is unlikely that the Senate will take up any House bill on the issue of police reform, it's likely that efforts have ended to pass federal legislation on the matter, despite a nationwide movement.

1,"A Black Lives Matter rally, billed to attract thousands in Sydney, was shut down by police before it began and its organiser arrested. The event in The Domain, which almost 5000 people had registered on Facebook to attend, came to nothing as NSW Police ordered protesters to disperse, 15 minutes before it was scheduled to begin at midday on Tuesday. See police shut the protest down in the video above Hundreds of police were on duty at the park and six arrests were made. Of the six, five were fined $1000 each and a sixth person, a 25-year-old woman, was issued a criminal infringement notice for offensive language. Organiser Paddy Gibson was one of those arrested and said supporters were asked to gather in groups of fewer than 20 after they failed on Monday to overturn a NSW Supreme Court decision prohibiting the protest. Gibson said organisers directed protesters to leave peacefully and without confronting police after being told mass arrests would otherwise occur. He said he'd been told by police that despite The Domain's size, only 20 people would be permitted in the park. We weren't allowed to give it a run even though Westfield is allowed, as well as the casino and the NRL,the 37 year old said. People are allowed to come together to make profits but they're not allowed to come together to say black lives matter - that's a disgraceful situation in NSW. They don't want to see us build unity, build power, demand accountability and demand justice from this government because it's too politically sensitive.Gibson said protesters would challenge any fines handed out. NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Willing warned that protesters who intended to rally outside NSW parliament on Tuesday would be arrested. Justice Mark Ierace on Sunday accepted the police argument that the possibility of community transmission of COVID-19 arising from the Sydney rally made the event too risky.

Cal Bahr, the Facebook post states. In his letter, Bahr, a CDL holder and trucking company owner, referenced the May 31st incident that involved a tanker truck encountering protesters on the highway. As someone who has a commercial driver's license myself, I know firsthand how dangerous this situation is for all concerned. On May 31st, a fuel hauler named Bogdan Virechko was trapped on the I-35W Bridge, blocked by protesters, which MNDOT had failed to secure properly. MNDOT has cameras everywhere along that road, and knowing that they had been unable to restrict traffic in that area, they allowed protesters to block it anyway. The situation could have resulted in many deaths but for the actions of Mr. Virechko, who was beaten by protesters and jailed for his trouble. I don't need to tell you that allowing situations like this to develop in Minnesota and other states strike at the heart of our interstate commerce system and our rights as citizens to move freely about the country and engage in transactions of all kinds. We are just coming out of a significant supply chain disruption due to the Government's response to COVID-19.

Some 17,000 people took part in the demonstration at its peak, according to police. The gathering was organized with the title ""The end of the pandemic day of freedom."" Some demonstrators chanted ""the biggest conspiracy theory is the pandemic,"" according to German media reports. A Stuttgart-based organization called Querdenken 711 which roughly translates as ""thinking outside the box 711"" organized the rally. The interior minister for the city of Berlin, Andreas Geisel, said on Friday that neo-Nazi organizations had also called for people to participate in the march. German media outlets noted that ""Day of Freedom"" was also the name of a Nazi propaganda film documenting the party's 1935 party congress in Nuremberg. One banner at the march called for politicians such as German Health Minister Jens Spahn, Bavaria's state premier Markus SÃ¶der, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leading virologist Christian Drosten to be ""locked away."" Protesters also ""aggressively asked"" journalists to remove their masks by protestors, newspaper Der Tagesspiegel reported. A video by Querdenken 711 before the march said the group was peaceful and called on attendees to be polite to journalists. Sawsan Chebli, a senior official in the Berlin city government, called the protest ""a disaster."" ""I just came from abroad and see these pictures. Many look to Germany, and admire us for how we have dealt with corona. Such pictures are a disaster. They destroy everything. They endanger human lives and destroy livelihoods. They scare me,"" she tweeted. I don't want to do without it,' the German ex-chancellor said about the popular sausage dish. With infection numbers on the rise, Berlin braces for the fall.

1,"Thousands of protesters demonstrated in the Mauritius capital Port Louis on Saturday to demand an investigation into an oil spill from a Japanese ship and the mysterious death of at least 40 dolphins that have been found near the site of the spill. Environmentalists have called for an investigation into whether the dolphins died as a result of the spill caused when the bulk carrier, the MV Wakashio, struck a coral reef last month. One protestor held a banner with a dolphin covered in oil reading our lives matterand another held one calling for the government to resign. Mauritian flags were waved across the packed square of St Louis Cathedral. We do not trust the government and the diluted information they've been feeding us regarding the management and responses to the oil spill,Fabiola Monty, 33 a Mauritian environmental scientist, told Reuters from the square. The government has said it will carry out autopsies on all the dead dolphins and has set up a commission to look into the oil spill. Two investigations are being carried out: one by the police on the crew's responsibilities and one by a senior Shipping Ministry official on what happened to the ship. So far veterinarians have examined only two of the mammals' carcasses, which bore signs of injury but no trace of oil in their bodies, according to preliminary autopsy results. The autopsy on the first two was conducted by the government-run Albion Fisheries Research Centre. Autopsy results on 25 dolphins that washed ashore Wednesday and Thursday are expected in the coming days, according to Jasvin Sok Appadu from the Fisheries Ministry. Local environmental group Eco-Sud, which took part in Saturday's protest, said in a statement on Friday that representatives from civil society should be present during the autopsies and called for a second opinion from independent specialists.

Vandalism of property, arson, blockades, looting, violence, and organized acts of terrorism have all been watched by certain Democrat officials. Often supported without condemnation.

1,"Police said ""fire bombs"" were thrown at officers during the protest overnight. Tensions boil over during protests on both coasts The 100th consecutive night of protests in Portland quickly escalated into a riot Saturday as people hurled ""multiple fire bombs, mortars, rocks and other items"" at officers, police said. One of the homemade bombs caught a community member on fire. Medics offered treatment at the scene, and the injured individual was later taken to a hospital by a private vehicle, according to a press release from the Portland Police Bureau. ""This criminal activity presented an extreme danger to life safety for all community members, and prompted a declaration of a riot,"" the law enforcement agency said in a statement early Sunday. More than 50 people were arrested overnight, including at least two who were clad in body armor. One individual was armed with a dagger while another had a knife, police said. The names of those arrested and their charges were not immediately released. Video posted on social media shows what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being thrown into the middle of crowd and exploding into flames on a residential street. One person's legs appears to catch fire as they run away. The video shows police in riot gear using flash-bang grenades while making loudspeaker announcements, ordering people to disperse the area. Some demonstrators are seen setting off fireworks in the street as police advance. A sergeant was struck by a commercial-grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Several other law enforcement officers were hit by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders and feet, with only their protective gear preventing serious injury, police said. Meanwhile, an Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents. The Portland Police Bureau said ""it was clear that the intent of the crowd was not peaceful protest,"" as many people were carrying large shields and were dressed in protective gear, including helmets, gas masks and body armor. The unrest in Oregon's largest city erupted following the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck as three other officers watched. Protests in cities across the United States and around the world are calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice. Many of the recent demonstrations in Portland have ended in arson, vandalism and violence. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested by authorities there since late May, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-seven people were arrested following a march Friday night, according to police, who accused protesters of throwing rocks at officers and chanting ""burn it down"" outside the offices of the Portland Police Association. Last weekend, a pro-Trump supporter was shot to death during dueling demonstrations in downtown Portland. The suspected gunman was killed during an encounter with authorities Thursday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events","Police said ""fire bombs"" were thrown at officers during the protest overnight.

More than 50 people were arrested overnight, including at least two who were clad in body armor. One individual was armed with a dagger while another had a knife, police said. The names of those arrested and their charges were not immediately released. Video posted on social media shows what appears to be a Molotov cocktail being thrown into the middle of crowd and exploding into flames on a residential street. One person's legs appears to catch fire as they run away. The video shows police in riot gear using flash-bang grenades while making loudspeaker announcements, ordering people to disperse the area. Some demonstrators are seen setting off fireworks in the street as police advance. A sergeant was struck by a commercial-grade firework, which burned through his glove and injured his hand, according to the Portland Police Bureau. Several other law enforcement officers were hit by rocks in the head, arms, shoulders and feet, with only their protective gear preventing serious injury, police said. Meanwhile, an Oregon State Police vehicle was damaged by rocks, including broken windows and dents. The Portland Police Bureau said ""it was clear that the intent of the crowd was not peaceful protest,"" as many people were carrying large shields and were dressed in protective gear, including helmets, gas masks and body armor. The unrest in Oregon's largest city erupted following the May 25 death of George Floyd, an unarmed 46-year-old Black man who died in Minneapolis after a white police officer was filmed kneeling on his neck as three other officers watched. Protests in cities across the United States and around the world are calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice. Many of the recent demonstrations in Portland have ended in arson, vandalism and violence. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested by authorities there since late May, according to The Associated Press. Twenty-seven people were arrested following a march Friday night, according to police, who accused protesters of throwing rocks at officers and chanting ""burn it down"" outside the offices of the Portland Police Association. Last weekend, a pro-Trump supporter was shot to death during dueling demonstrations in downtown Portland. The suspected gunman was killed during an encounter with authorities Thursday. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",780,english

(Antioch Police Department via AP) A 17-year-old from Illinois who is charged with killing two people during a protest in Wisconsin and whose case has become a rallying cry for some conservatives posted $2 million bail Friday and was released from custody. Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of fatally shooting Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and wounding Gaige Grosskreutz during a demonstration Aug. 25 that followed the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha. He posted bond through his attorney at about 2 p.m., Kenosha County Sheriff's Sgt. David Wright said. Rittenhouse, of Antioch, Illinois, told police he was attacked while he was guarding a business and that he fired in self-defense. He faces multiple charges, including intentional homicide, reckless endangerment and being a minor in possession of a firearm. Wisconsin law doesn't permit minors to carry or possess a gun unless they're hunting. He is due back in court on Dec. 3 for a preliminary hearing. His case has taken on political overtones. Supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement have painted Rittenhouse as a trigger-happy white supremacist. Conservatives upset over property destruction during recent protests have portrayed him as a patriot exercising his right to bear arms during unrest. A legal defense fund for him has attracted millions of dollars in donations, and his mother got a standing ovation from women at a Waukesha County GOP function in September. Huber's father, John Huber, asked Kenosha County Circuit Court Commissioner Loren Keating during a hearing Nov. 2 to set Rittenhouse's bail between $4 million and $10 million. Huber said Rittenhouse thinks he's above the law and noted the effort to raise money on his behalf. He also suggested militia groups would hide him from police if he were released. Rittenhouse's attorney, Mark Richards, asked for $750,000 bail. Keating ultimately set bail at $2 million, saying Rittenhouse was a flight risk given the seriousness of the charges against him.

1,"ADVERTISEMENT SHARE Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) likened President Donald Trump's campaign rallies to Ku Klux Klan rallies in a Monday interview with the Washington Post. Trump ""chose to speak about me at every single rally, didn't really matter where he was, sometimes multiple times in a day, as he held his Klan rallies across the country,"" Omar said to Post opinion writer Jonathan Capehart. Omar, a member of the far-left group of House Democrats known as ""the Squad,"" reflected on ousting President Trump and what she perceived as ""a four-year assault"" on refugees and immigrants like her. She also discussed infighting between moderate and leftist Democrats, sparked by the party's lackluster House and Senate election results. Omar said in the interview that the rift within the Democratic Party ""isn't as strong as it's being made out to be,"" despite House Democrats' chaotic post-election phone call. During the call, Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who was first elected to the House alongside Omar in 2018, blamed leftists' radical anti-police and socialist messaging for her near-loss in this election. Throughout the Trump presidency, ""the Squad"" and other progressive Democrats have likened President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists and white supremacists. Omar also compared the president's rallies to Klan rallies in a tweet last year. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) quoted a Klansman to criticize Trump's national security policies in a tweet last year, and failed Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke compared Trump's rallies to Nazi meetings.

Omar, a member of the far-left group of House Democrats known as ""the Squad,"" reflected on ousting President Trump and what she perceived as ""a four-year assault"" on refugees and immigrants like her. She also discussed infighting between moderate and leftist Democrats, sparked by the party's lackluster House and Senate election results. Omar said in the interview that the rift within the Democratic Party ""isn't as strong as it's being made out to be,"" despite House Democrats' chaotic post-election phone call. During the call, Abigail Spanberger (D., Va.), who was first elected to the House alongside Omar in 2018, blamed leftists' radical anti-police and socialist messaging for her near-loss in this election. Throughout the Trump presidency, ""the Squad"" and other progressive Democrats have likened President Donald Trump and his supporters to fascists and white supremacists. Omar also compared the president's rallies to Klan rallies in a tweet last year. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D., N.Y.) quoted a Klansman to criticize Trump's national security policies in a tweet last year, and failed Democratic presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke compared Trump's rallies to Nazi meetings.

1,"A view of the Supreme Court building. Bhopal/Mandsaur: A Dalit law student has appealed to the Supreme Court for legislation to stop family members of lawmakers and bureaucrats from getting the benefits of reservation. The development comes against the backdrop of a swirling debate on the quota system in the country, particularly after the SC ruled this month that there is no fundamental right to reservations in appointments and promotions under articles 16(4) and 16(4A) of the Constitution. The petitioner, 25-year-old Vikram Kumar Bagde, a native of Madhya Pradesh Neemuch town, is also of the view that just like people can voluntarily give up cooking gas and rail travel subsidy, the resourceful section of the reserved categories should have the option to forgo the benefits to ensure the 80% deprived community members can take much-needed advantage. Bagde, whose father is a peon, says he never availed caste reservation after clearing class XII, made it through the law entrance examination as a general category candidate, and is currently a first-year LLB student in Rajiv Gandhi College, Mandsaur. I had filed the PIL with the Supreme Court on January 25 and it was admitted on February 2, said Bagde, adding that the date of hearing is yet to be finalised by the court. Explaining the reasons behind filing the public interest litigation, he said that children from affluent families are more likely to get selected in any entrance test or recruitment process owing to their well-funded preparations rather than someone from a less-privileged background. On this basis, he has urged the apex court to stop the kin of lawmakers and grade 1 government officers from availing the perks of reservation. Citing his interactions with several politicians in Madhya Pradesh, Bagde said eligible legislators could continue to take advantage of reservation provisions in elections but their family members should be prevented from doing it in education and jobs. The law student, who says he sees a dire need of reservation for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes but doesnt have much knowledge of quota provisions in his region, even tried surrendering his caste certificate but was purportedly told by several MPs and MLAs that no such clause exists. I have in my PIL urged the SC to ensure legislation to enable those who wish to shun reservation benefits on the lines of LPG subsidy and rail travel concessions, said Bagde. He also argued that the race to grab reservation benefits is assuming dangerous proportions, triggering social tensions and divisions. Influential people from within the reserved categories should lead by example, Bagde said, maintaining that this would inspire others to give up quota benefits.","A view of the Supreme Court building.

1,"A 20-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly abducted and gang raped and assaulted by two policemen in a hotel room in UP Gorakhpur on Thursday night. The police dismissed the charges, saying both the CCTV footage of hotel and the statement by hotel guard makes it clear that the woman had gone to the hotel on her own, triggering public outrage with many slamming protectors turning predators in the chief minister own city. Following the public outrage over the incident and the pressure to act against culprits, an FIR into the incident was lodged at the Cantonment police station late on Friday night. Leaders of political parties including Congress district president Nirmala Paswan, BSP workers led by district president Ghanshyam Rahi and BJP MLC Devendra Pratap Singh met the victim at the district hospital, where she was admitted after the incident. SSP Sunil Gupta said, Yesterday, on February 14, a woman came to the district hospital and alleged that two policemen took her away on a bike and raped her in a hotel. The police acted swiftly on the complaint after which name of a hotel surfaced. During detailed investigation, the charges were found to be untrue. It came to the fore, on the basis of CCTV footage and the statement of hotel guard that the woman had gone to the hotel on her own. So, prima facie, the matter seems to be suspicious. However an FIR has been lodged for further action. According to reports, the incident occurred on Thursday night when the woman was returning home with her mother and elder sister on Thursday night at around 9pm on foot. According to the woman, as she walked ahead of her mother, two bike-borne policemen came and forced her to sit on their bike. When she resisted they threatened to frame her in a sex racket and assured that they will let her go after questioning at the police station. Instead of the police station, the duo took her to a hotel room, forced her to consume alcohol and then raped her taking turns. They also beat her up and gave her Rs 600 while threatening her not to open her mouth. On returning home late at night, she narrated her ordeal to her mother. On Saturday, Congress workers led by Nirmala Paswan staged a sit-in at the DM office.

1," In late 1980s, Bhanwar Meghwanshi, a 13-year-old from the Dalit community, started attending the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh shakhas in Rajasthan, without knowing much about the organisation. Over the course of around four years, Meghwanshi grew to harbour a visceral hatred for Muslims and began to take immense pride in his Hindu identity. He dedicated himself to the cause of the RSS Hindu Rashtra, even receiving military training by the organisation. But after facing discrimination within the RSS, he realised that its vision is different for caste Hindus and Dalits. Meghwanshi is now a journalist and an activist. His book Main Ek Karsevak ThaI Was a Karsevakwas first published in Hindi in 2019 and its English translation, I Could Not Be Hindu: The Story of a Dalit in the RSS, was published by Navayana in January this year. That month, Sushil Kumar, an independent journalist, spoke to Meghwanshi about the RSS process of indoctrinating its cadre, its glorification of violence and its vision for a Hindu Rashtra. Sushil Kumar: In which period were you in the RSS?Bhanwar Meghwanshi: I was active from 1987 to 1991. I participated in the first karaseva of 1990. I had left home to dismantle the Babri Masjid [in Uttar Pradesh Ayodhya], but did not reach, as the [Samajwadi Party chief] Mulayam Singh government was in power. At that time, we used to call him Mulla-yam Singh, meaning maulana Mulayam. His government arrested me, near the Tundla station, and kept me in the Agra jail for some ten days. By then, whatever karaseva had to take place had taken place. Then I returned home. SK: Were there any women at the shakha?BM: At the shakha, all were men. We talked only about purusharth, male dominance. It is evident that there was no place for women. Seen one way, the meaning of purushartha is masculinity, patriarchy. SK: What did you learn during your time as a swayamsevak?BM: I got to learn many things. First thing, I evidently became a reactionary.

1,"Speaker Om Birla conducts proceedings in the Lok Sabha during the Budget Session of Parliament in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI) New Delhi: The Congress on Monday accused the government of not allowing a debate in Parliament on the issue of communal violence in Delhi, while also alleging that one of its Dalit MPs was assaulted by a BJP lawmaker. The opposition party said it will continue to protest in Parliament over the communal violence in Delhi as it is its duty to uncover the ""conspiracy"" behind the riots. BJP and Congress members pushed and shoved each other in the Lok Sabha on Monday as opposition parties vehemently protested over the issue of violence in Delhi and demanded resignation of Home Minister Amit Shah. Speaking to reporters after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, Congress' leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party demanded that the violence in Delhi be discussed in the Lower House of Parliament as it was a very important issue and the world was talking about it. The party demanded that there should be a debate on the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah participating as all Indians want it to happen, Chowdhury said. ""The government should put forward its views on it. We were trying to make this request, but the government did not allow us to do so and kept making one excuse after another,"" he said. ""What is surprising is that when Delhi was burning, the ruling party thought that 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill should be brought. Without asking us, they started discussing the bill,"" the Congress leader said. Chowdhury said ""democracy was torn to shreds"" as the Opposition party was not allowed to air its views. ""The sad part is that a Dalit MP of our party from Kerala was assaulted by ruling party MP. She also started crying and said 'if this happens inside the House to Dalits what will happen outside',"" he said. ""Our protest will continue. It is our duty to uncover who makes hate speeches, who indulge in killings and what is the conspiracy behind the violence,"" Chowdhury said. Congress MP Ramya Haridas on Monday lodged a complaint with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she was assaulted by BJP MP Jaskaur Meena inside the Lower House of Parliament and sought immediate action over the matter. Earlier, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that for three days riots continued unabated, but Union ministers did not make any statement and did not visit the riot-affected areas. ""Because of that police also did not act,"" he said. ""The central government wanted that those who are dying, let them die and those who are being burnt alive, let it happen. Hate speeches were given by leaders of the ruling party which meant that the central government was behind the riots,"" he alleged. All business in Parliament should be adjourned to discuss the issue of Delhi violence, Azad said.","Speaker Om Birla conducts proceedings in the Lok Sabha during the Budget Session of Parliament in New Delhi on Monday.

Speaking to reporters after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, Congress' leader in the House Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the party demanded that the violence in Delhi be discussed in the Lower House of Parliament as it was a very important issue and the world was talking about it. The party demanded that there should be a debate on the issue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah participating as all Indians want it to happen, Chowdhury said. ""The government should put forward its views on it. We were trying to make this request, but the government did not allow us to do so and kept making one excuse after another,"" he said. ""What is surprising is that when Delhi was burning, the ruling party thought that 'Vivaad Se Vishwas' Bill should be brought. Without asking us, they started discussing the bill,"" the Congress leader said. Chowdhury said ""democracy was torn to shreds"" as the Opposition party was not allowed to air its views. ""The sad part is that a Dalit MP of our party from Kerala was assaulted by ruling party MP. She also started crying and said 'if this happens inside the House to Dalits what will happen outside',"" he said. ""Our protest will continue. It is our duty to uncover who makes hate speeches, who indulge in killings and what is the conspiracy behind the violence,"" Chowdhury said. Congress MP Ramya Haridas on Monday lodged a complaint with Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla that she was assaulted by BJP MP Jaskaur Meena inside the Lower House of Parliament and sought immediate action over the matter. Earlier, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad alleged that for three days riots continued unabated, but Union ministers did not make any statement and did not visit the riot-affected areas. ""Because of that police also did not act,"" he said. ""The central government wanted that those who are dying, let them die and those who are being burnt alive, let it happen. Hate speeches were given by leaders of the ruling party which meant that the central government was behind the riots,"" he alleged. All business in Parliament should be adjourned to discuss the issue of Delhi violence, Azad said.",723.75,english

1,"Lucknow, April 10 : BSP president Mayawati has demanded stern action against Subrat Pathak, the BJP MP from Kannauj, for his involvement in a case of assault against a Dalit tehsildar. In a statement, Mayawati has urged UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath to intervene in the matter and ensure action against the accused MP. The BJP MP Subrat Pathak, accompanied by 20 to 25 men, had allegedly broken into the house of the tehsildar, Arvind Kumar, on Monday and had assaulted him over the distribution of ration to people mentioned in a list sent by him. Mayawati said, ""The incident from Kannauj where an honest Dalit tehsildar was beaten by a BJP MP is shameful. What is more concerning is that he is still roaming scot-free instead of going to jail."" Demanding that Adityanath look into the matter, she wrote that recurrence of such incidents must be stopped and Dalits should not be attacked in this manner. ""Stern action is needed against the MP. This is what the BSP demands,"" she stated. A case has been registered against Pathak and 25 unidentified men, and around 10 vehicles have been seized from the site of the assault. The tehsildar had earlier said that he had explained to the MP over the phone that other senior officials were looking into the distribution of ration to people mentioned in his list. However, despite the explanation, the lawmaker abused and threatened him. Pathak's supporters have denied the incident, saying that they had gone only to discuss some development projects with Kumar.

The incident took place around 5 PM. Police lobbed teargas shells to disperse the crowd and resorted to mild lathi-charge, even as the victims alleged that the force did nothing to help them. The victims also claimed that the attackers were residents of Samter village, who wanted to avenge the arrest of 12 persons in connection with last month Una Dalit flogging case. The 20 victims, who are from Bhavnagar district, had gone to Una on their motorcycles along with others.

1,"A Dalit human right activist Martin Macwan has written to Congress president Sonia Gandhi demanding the removal of a statue of Manu installed in the premises of the Rajasthan High Court. The letter states that the statue of Manu is an insult to the Indian Constitution and Dalits and it weakens the call of Dr Bhimrao Ambedkar to annihilate caste for India to grow as a nation. The statue does not just symbolize Dalit oppression, but it symbolizes the oppression of women and of shudras. In all, that makes up about 85 per cent of the population of India, says Macwan, who is the founder of Navsarjan Trust, a grassroots Dalit organization based in Gujarat. Macwan adds that the statue is a symbol of an oppressive past and harks to the lived reality of Dalits and women in India, whose lives are still affected by the discriminatory laws put down by Manu in his text Manusmriti. The text is known to have formalized regulations around the caste system and the patriarchal values often propagated in Hindu tradition. What is even worse is that unlike the statues of slave owners and confederate leaders that have been brought down in the US, this statue was not put up hundreds of years ago. It was put up 31 years ago by a few advocates who viewed Manu as one of the earliest people to write law in India and hence wanted to establish that legacy, says Macwan. The statue was put up by a lawyers body that got the approval from the Rajasthan government to put it up outside the High Court in 1989. It is not like the statue was set up in a public place, it was set up in a place that represents an institution of our government. How can we continue to condone that, adds Macwan. There have been many attempts to bring down the Manu statue over the last 30 years. In July 1989, just six months after the statue was placed, a panel of judges from the Rajasthan High Court ordered its removal. Following this, a PIL was filed against the order, and since then the court order for the removal of the statues has been stayed. More recently, in 2018, two Dalit women from Aurangabad, who are members of the Republican Party of India, travelled all the way to Jaipur to climb up the Manu statue and smear it with paint. The two women have an ongoing case against them. In 2020, we are not only celebrating 73 years of Independence, but also 93 years since Dr Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti. It is high time we get rid of that statue, says Macwan. Macwan and members of Navsarjan Trust have given an ultimatum to the Congress government in Rajasthan, stating that if the statue is not removed by August 15, they will call for an agitation.

1,"Representative image. A Right to Information (RTI) query and swift action by the State Information Commission finally managed to bring water to a parched remote Dalit locality in Madhya Pradesh.  This was made possible after Rewa-based activist moved the RTI application on May 26 with the Public Health Engineering Department seeking information on the action taken regarding the digging of a borewell in Nevaria locality under Gangev block. Activist Shivanand Dwivedi said in his plea that it was a matter pertaining to Right to Life and offering a reply within 48 hours under section 7 (1) of the RTI Act was mandatory. However, after 216 hours (nine days), Executive Engineer Sharad Patel said that fetching water from a distance of 900m was not a violation of Right to Life. Dwivedi said about 100 Dalit members of the tribal locality did not even have access to this source 900m away during summer and had to look for water elsewhere. This (PHE) is the same department which digs borewells in the courtyards of the high and mighty against norms, Dwivedi told News18. As a reply to Dwidevi first appeal, Appellant Officer Sharad Chaudhary wrote on email on June 3 blaming the executive engineer for the mess, adding that he has directed the officer to visit the locality on June 2 and prepare a proposal of digging borewell in a week. Meanwhile, on May 30, Dwivedi had made a second appeal to Information Commissioner Rahul Singh through Whatsapp and email. On June 2, Singh issued a six-page notice to both the officers and asked them to appear for a hearing via video conference between 12-1pm on June 4. In the intervening night of June 3 and 4, the PHE officials landed at Nevaria locality in Rewa, dug up a borewell and informed the commission about the move next morning. Stating that the RTI in this case not only offered a reply to the applicant, but also managed to bring water to the parched land after decades of Independence, Singh said herein lies the importance of the Act in serving the common people cause. Singh said that while technology has been used in some cases earlier as well, it has become extremely useful and emerged as a new normal in times of a pandemic where social distancing is key. This has also helped in faster disposal of RTI appeals, which earlier used to take months some times, while saving money of the state exchequer as well as applicants, he added. Dwivedi said the villagers of Nevaria were extremely grateful to the information commissioner for addressing their water woes that had been ignored for years.","Representative image.

1,"Police have booked three people for allegedly hurling casteist abuses at a Dalit man after refusing to give him a haircut when he visited their shop in Dangarthal village in Niwai in Tonk district on Tuesday. According to the FIR, the incident took place on Tuesday when Kalu Harijan went to Nandkishore Sain shop in the village for a haircut. Sain at first demanded Rs 500 from me for a haircut. After a while I was ready to pay even that. Following that he refused to cut my hair and drove me out of his shop saying that I was from a low caste and he wont cut my hair. He hurled casteist abuses at me, alleged Harijan, who works as a labourer. He claimed that when he went to other salons in the village, they too refused to cut his hair. Sain told me that he is the president of all haircut shop owners in Dangarsal and nobody would cut my hair. After he abused me and shoved me out, I went to several other shops but none of them were ready to have me as a customer, said Harijan. An FIR has been lodged against Sain and his two sons under Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and Sections of the SC/ST (prevention of atrocities) Act. We are investigating the matter It is to be seen whether the complainant was misbehaved with because of his caste or the dispute happened over maintaining social distancing standards, said Anjum Kayal, circle officer, Niwai, and the investigating officer in the case. Dalit rights activists have demanded that the accused be arrested. The victim was misbehaved with only because of the fact that he is a Dalit. The state should come out with a separate budget to spread awareness against caste discrimination.

1,"File photo of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. (Image: PTI) In a letter to interim Congress President Sonia Gandhi, nearly 600 Dalit activists, scholars and well-wishers have urged to remove Manu's statue from the premises of the Rajasthan High Court, saying the statue is an ""insult to the Indian Constitution and Dalits"". ""We are writing this letter because we believe that as the President of the Indian National Congress, which has the government in power in Rajasthan, you have the required power to take a step which would prove historic in strengthening the Dalit movement for equality,"" said the letter written by Martin Macwan, founder of Navsarjan Trust, a grassroots Dalit organisation based out of Gujarat. He said the statue of Manu is ""an insult to the Indian Constitution as well as Dalits, women and all those who believe in equality and justice"". According to Hindu mythology, Manu is the progenitor of mankind and the author of the controversial 'Manusmriti', which codifies the rights and duties of various social groups. Macwan wrote that the statue is a symbol of an oppressive past and harks to the reality of Dalits and women in India, whose lives are still affected by the discriminatory laws put down by Manu in Manusmriti. The text is known to have formalised regulations around the caste system and the patriarchal values often propagated in Hindu tradition. ""Moreover, the law of Manu stands in total contradiction to what the Indian Constitution has committed itself to, while the latter upholds equality and fraternity, social justice and freedom, the former indulges in archaic teaching about inequality and social segregation, hierarchy and division, injustice and servitude. ""That this country has tolerated this contradiction for 73 years post-Independence is testimony to our failure to live by the invaluable heritage of the Constitution bequeathed to us by Dr Ambedkar and the Constitution-makers,"" the letter said. The statue, built in 1989 by the Rajasthan Judicial Officers Association, has withstood several protests, court cases and even an order by judges to remove it.

An inquiry was ordered into the incident after police officials were seen using force on the deceased couple. A probe was ordered into the case by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh.

The incident took place on Tuesday when an eviction drive was being carried on government land. The deceased man was identified as Rajkumar Ahirwar. Initially, the government had tweeted that the couple consumed poison after they were ""instigated by some people"". The 45-bigha government land in Jaganpur Chak was allotted to construct a college but the same land was encroached upon by Gappu Pardhi, a 'land mafia'. Gappu had allegedly rented the land to Rajkumar for farming. When the revenue officials went to the area for the encroachment, Rajkumar and his family raised an objection. In the video that went viral, the police could be seen thrashing the couple with lathis. Rajkumar and his wife were being kicked by a policewoman. A senior official quoted the CM and said, ""My government will take strong action against mafia and criminals but force is not to be used against common people.

An attempt to clear it in November last year had been blocked by the family of Gappu Pardhi, who claims to own the land. Ahirwar told the officials that he had taken the land on lease and raised loan to cultivate it, and the family would have no option but to end their lives if their crop was destroyed. After the couple consumed pesticide, the police had booked them as well as others for trying to obstruct public officials on duty. Before he was removed, Collector Vishwanathan told The Indian Express that the police had to use force as Ahirwar relatives were not letting them take the couple to hospital. He also said the government had sanctioned Rs 12 crore for construction of the college, and any further delay could have resulted in it being shifted to another district.

1,"The custodial death of a Dalit man has sparked an intense outrage in the state of Andhra Pradesh after the opposition parties have slammed the ruling Jagan Mohan Reddy led government against the police excess handling and attacking the Dalits in the state. The fresh resentments have erupted after the death of a Dalit man identified as Yericharla Kiran, who died in the police custody on the night hours of Tuesday in Prakasam district of the state. Kiran was reportedly arrested and taken under the police custody for not wearing a face mask while he was riding his vehicle. According to the reports, Kiran was arrested by the police on July 18 under the grounds of not wearing a mask, which was mandated to follow to curb the COVID-19 spread. He and his friend were riding in a COVID-19 hotspot of Chirala town in Prakasam district without wearing masks and helmet. According to the police, the duo was stopped and constable Rami Reddy had scolded them for violating the guidelines. The police stated that the duo was under the influence of alcohol and developed the altercation with the constable. Later, they were taken under custody by Sub-Inspector (SI) Vijay Kumar. After being taken under custody, Kiran was taken to the Chirala Government Hospital after sustaining a severe head injury. He was then taken to a private hospital in Guntur for further treatments. However, he has died at the hospital on Tuesday while he was under the police custody and his death has stirred massive outrage against what has become the shocking incident of police brutality. According to the police's version, Kiran has jumped out of the moving police vehicle while he was being taken to the police station following which he has got an injury in his head. However, Kiran's family members refuted the assertion of the police and they alleged that he had died due to the head injury that happened due to the police beating. Following the development, Kiran's father has lodged a complaint against Sub-Inspector Vijay Kumar, and based on his complaint, Vijay Kumar has been booked under section 324 of IPC - voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons. The Andhra Pradesh government has launched the probe into the death of the Dalit man. Chief Minister Jagan Mohan Reddy said that Rs 10 lakh will be provided to the family of the deceased as a solatium. According to the reports, the probe would be conducted by the Additional Superintendent of Police. On Wednesday, Chirala had seen an outrage following Kiran's death, leaving the government to deploy more police forces for the security measures. Condemning the incident, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) General Secretary Nara Lokesh said that the police had thrashed Dalit Kumar with the view of receiving appreciation from the ruling party leaders. By stating that the police are attacking the Dalits like goondas, he questioned the prevalence of the law and order in the state.

1,"The Odisha Human Rights Commission (OHRC) has taken suo motu cognizance of 40 Dalit families facing social boycott from upper caste villagers in Kantio Kateni village of Dhenkanal district and sought a report in the matter from the authorities by September 15. Citing news reports, the commission has observed that the 40 scheduled caste families have been living in fear after people from the upper castes allegedly excommunicated them from the village. The issue allegedly got momentum from a trivial matter of confrontation between the scheduled castes and the upper caste over plucking of flowers by some girls of the SC community, it said. Now the said SC community people are barred from going to shop, sharecropping, doing work under MGNREGS,taking out procession, participating in social functions etc. for which they are unable to fetch day to day requirements also. It is also alleged that the villagers have stopped talking with the SC community people, the commission stated. The order passed by the commission Chairperson Justice Bimla Prasad Das termed social ostracism/boycott an inhuman practice and emphasised that it requires serious attention and action by state authorities. In this background while taking cognizance of the matter suo motu, we have no alternative than to caution the authorities to take effective steps against the persons responsible for it after due inquiry and give us a report. Let the Collector and the District Magistrate Dhenkanal and Superintendent of Police, enquire into the matter and give their respective reports to the commission, the order stated. Meanwhile, following the intervention of authorities, the situation in the village is returning to normalcy. Sarpanch Pranabandhu Das said, We have been holding repeated dialogues between the two communities. Things are now moving back to normal. The diktat to not speak to each other does not exist anymore. The matter had escalated after the girls plucked flowers from the backyard of Saisdeba Behera (36). Behera said the communities are working towards resolving pending issues. I grow sunflowers and sell them for oil production. That day, three girls started plucking the flowers. I objected because they couldnt have used it for prayers, they were simply wasting the flowers. Soon their elders joined in and a brawl broke out between members of the two communities, he said. We reached out to the police and the matter was resolved, but the girls started making false allegations that I tried to misbehave. They approached the police with these false accusations. Because of this, multiple meetings were held and we decided to boycott them, Behera added. Jyoti Naik, a member of the Dalit community, said, It is true that the situation is limping to normalcy. But it will take a while to bury all issues and move ahead. For now, it is important that we are deprived of our rights. The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

It is also alleged that the villagers have stopped talking with the SC community people, the commission stated. The order passed by the commission Chairperson Justice Bimla Prasad Das termed social ostracism/boycott an inhuman practice and emphasised that it requires serious attention and action by state authorities. In this background while taking cognizance of the matter suo motu, we have no alternative than to caution the authorities to take effective steps against the persons responsible for it after due inquiry and give us a report. Let the Collector and the District Magistrate Dhenkanal and Superintendent of Police, enquire into the matter and give their respective reports to the commission, the order stated. Meanwhile, following the intervention of authorities, the situation in the village is returning to normalcy. Sarpanch Pranabandhu Das said, We have been holding repeated dialogues between the two communities. Things are now moving back to normal. The diktat to not speak to each other does not exist anymore. The matter had escalated after the girls plucked flowers from the backyard of Saisdeba Behera (36). Behera said the communities are working towards resolving pending issues. I grow sunflowers and sell them for oil production. That day, three girls started plucking the flowers. I objected because they couldnt have used it for prayers, they were simply wasting the flowers. Soon their elders joined in and a brawl broke out between members of the two communities, he said. We reached out to the police and the matter was resolved, but the girls started making false allegations that I tried to misbehave. They approached the police with these false accusations. Because of this, multiple meetings were held and we decided to boycott them, Behera added. Jyoti Naik, a member of the Dalit community, said, It is true that the situation is limping to normalcy. But it will take a while to bury all issues and move ahead. For now, it is important that we are deprived of our rights. ",800.75,english

1,"After a Dalit girl plucked a flower from the garden of an upper caste resident in an Odisha village, the entire community has been boycotted. Caste hierarchies and deeply entrenched inequalities in the domain of Indian society depict the most disturbing truth wherein despite over seven decades of independence, we continue to nurture a social fabric that discriminates and exploits people on the basis of their caste affiliations. This truth became even more apparent when forty Dalit families in the Kantio Kateni village of Odisha were asked to leave and village and go after they were subjected to more than two weeks of boycott after a Dalit girl from the community was caught plucking flowers from the garden of an upper caste family. For having plucked flowers from the garden of an upper caste family not only the little girl and her family, but more than 40 households of the Dalits were humiliated and assaulted for over two weeks and they were also asked to leave the village. This led to a sustained conflict between the upper and lower castes in the village and as a result the upper castes boycotted over 40 Dalit families. The girl who had allegedly picked up flowers from the garden of an upper caste resident of the village is reported to have immediately apologised so that they matter could be resolved on the spot but after a series of meetings, it was decided that all the Dalit families living in the village will be boycotted and it was also decided that they would no longer be allowed to participate in any social event of the village. The village has a total of 800 families and 40 households belonging to the SC Naik community. As part of the social boycott that is being sustained against these 40 families, milk and grocery stores in the village have stopped selling their items to them and everybody outside the caste fold has stopped talking to them. The upper castes have also ensured that the lower castes are not given any work in the village and are compelled to move out of the village in search of work. They have also been warned against taking out processions related to funerals and marriages and their children have been denied the right to study in the government school in the premises of the village. The police have said that even if after the conduction of several meetings between the elders of both the communities matters are not resolved, they will be completed to register an FIR.

Don't miss out on the latest News Bijay Kumar Minj, New Delhi Updated: September 08, 2020 03:43 AM GMT Dalit Christians, activists and civil society protest in New Delhi on Dec. 4, 2018, demanding that the Indian government give them the same rights as enjoyed by their Hindu counterparts. (Photo: Bijay Kumar Minj/UCA News)  Dalit Catholic leaders across India have threatened to start a new church if their demand to end casteism and discrimination against Dalits in the Catholic Church is not met. Around 30 speakers and 150 participants attended a virtual meeting on Sept. 5 organized by six Dalit Christian organizations from the southern state of Tamil Nadu. If the Vatican does not immediately remove the discriminatory process of bishop selection that neglects qualified Dalit priests, we could announce our own Indian Dalit Catholic Church or the Indian Dalit Catholic Rite, Franklin Caesar Thomas, coordinator of the National Council of Dalit Christians (NCDC), told UCA News. The new church will separate Dalit Catholic Christians from the Indian Catholic Church's casteist leadership. During the virtual meeting, Dalit leaders appealed to the Catholic Church, the apostolic nuncio to India and Pope Francis to curb the visible and invisible untouchability practices that exist in the selection of bishops. They said that none of India four cardinals and 31 archbishops have a Dalit background. Similarly, among 188 bishops, only 11 are from the Dalit community. In caste-ridden Tamil Nadu, only one of 18 bishops is from a Dalit background. Dalits, formerly untouchables, are the lowest caste within Hindu society. Huge numbers of Dalits have converted to Christianity and Islam over the decades, though the religions offer limited protection from societal prejudice. The word Dalit means ""trampled upon"" in Sanskrit and refers to all groups once considered untouchable and outside the four-tier Hindu caste system. Government data shows 201 million of India 1.2 billion people belong to this socially deprived group. Some 60 percent of India's 25 million Christians are of Dalit or tribal origin. Vincent Manoharan, national convener of National Dalit Christian Watch (NDCW), told UCA News that years of protests by the Dalit Christian community had not brought any positive changes. He said protest marches are planned near the nuncio office and the headquarters of the Catholic Bishops Conference of India (CBCI). Dalit Christians are fighting for their respective place in the Church as well as fighting in the Supreme Court for their scheduled caste status in society, Manoharan said. From now onwards we will have national and international conventions to press our demand to end casteism and discrimination against Dalits in the Catholic Church. Unfortunately, our brethren are suffering in both the Church and society. We are also planning to send our representative to the Vatican, United Nations and the European Union so that we can build a pressure group at international level.

1,"Posted on 26 September 2020 by Admin_markaz JIH V-P Prof. Salim Engineer  New Delhi, 26 Sept. 2020: Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) has condemned the reported gang rape of a 19-year-old Dalit girl from a village in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh. In a statement issued to the media today, JIH Vice President Prof Salim Engineer said: Jamaat-e-Islami Hind condemns the alleged gang rape of a Dalit girl in Boolgarhi village, Hathras district, UP. It is reported that she is in the ICU at a hospital in Aligarh and on a ventilator, fighting for her life. Her tongue was cut off; the spinal cord severely injured and has several injuries on her neck. Four upper caste men have been charged with gang rape and attempt to murder along with the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police have managed to arrest three of the accused. Reports suggest that the village has around 600-odd families of which only 15 families belong to the Dalit community. The Dalits always faced harassment and intimidation at the hands of the upper-caste villagers who make up around 400 families. Prof Salim Engineer averred: We demand expeditious inquiry and trial of the case and expect the UP government to ensure that swift justice is delivered to the victim. Cases of rape and sexual harassment are on the rise in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Recently there have been cases of rape of minors in Maharajganj, Lakhimpur Kheri, Meerut and Greater Noida. The administration must take cognizance of this spike in sexual crimes by sprucing its law and order machinery. Crimes increase in places where criminals feel emboldened by weak law enforcement and feel that they can manage the system and go unpunished. The question of Dalit atrocities is a long unresolved problem in India and requires both society and the state to contribute in solving it. They remain barred from entry into places of worship, denied access to water facilities, and seating among other upper-caste villagers On the one hand, the state has to ensure that there will be zero-tolerance for any hate crime and Dalit atrocity and no violation of dignity will go unpunished. Moreover, social activists, religious leaders and political parties must take up the project of social engineering and motivate people to adhere to the principle of equality, universal brotherhood and human fraternity. The dream of economic prosperity despite gross income inequality and social injustice is a disillusionment that we can ill afford to harbor.

A 19-year-old Indian girl, reportedly gang-raped by four ""upper-caste"" men, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh this month, succumbed to her injuries at a hospital in New Delhi on Tuesday morning. The victim was transferred to Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital from another facility in the regional town of Aligarh. She was taken to the Aligarh hospital on 15 September, a day after she was allegedly sexually assaulted by four men on a farm in the neighbouring town of Hathras. All four people named by the victim have been arrested and charged under relevant sections of the Indian penal code, including murder and carrying out atrocities against Dalit or people in the lowest strata of the caste system. The incident sparked outrage across the Indian political spectrum as well as social media, with many prominent personalities taking potshots at the state government for rising atrocities against members of the socially underprivileged Dalit community in Uttar Pradesh. The northern state, which is India's most populous, is governed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Lamenting the increasing occurrence of sexual assaults in the state, general secretary of India's main opposition party, Congress, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra remarked that such incidents have sent a shiver down the spines of everyone.

On the basis of a complaint from the victim's family members, a former village head's son Kishan Upadhyay and two others -- Ashish and Satish -- were arrested under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Mittal said. The family members alleged that the girl ended her life as her complaint was not registered, a charge denied by the police, who said that the victim's kin had not given any application to lodge an FIR. The SP said the post-mortem did not confirm rape and the samples would now be sent to a Forensic Sciences Laboratory (FSL). The girl will be cremated on Wednesday in the village, where elaborate security arrangements have been made.

1," The police in Uttar Pradesh said a dismembered body of a 15-year-old Dalit girl was found in a maize field in Kanpur Dehat district on Saturday, PTI reported. The police suspect that the girl, who was missing for a week, was killed over a property dispute. Superintendent of Police of Kanpur Dehat Keshav Kumar Choudhary claimed the girl was abducted and killed by her uncles, ruling out the possibility of rape. Choudhary said they have arrested two of the girl uncles, 65-year-old Brij Lal and 60-year-old Jiya Lal. They have allegedly confessed to killing her over a property dispute. The teenager father had accused them of murdering his daughter over the land dispute, according to Hindustan Times. The police officer said local residents found the girl body 500 metres away from her native Gaholia Rura village. Her body was partially eaten, possibly by wild animals, he added. Choudhary said the body of the girl has been sent for autopsy and they were waiting for the results to ascertain the exact cause of her death. Meanwhile, the police said a four-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her relative under the limits of Khair police station in Aligarh. Superintendent of Police of Aligarh Rural Shubham Patel said the girl was admitted to a hospital and her condition was stable. The incidents came amid nationwide outrage over the gangrape and murder of a 20-year-old woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh. Opposition leaders have highlighted several other violent incidents in the state in recent days, including allegations of a similar gangrape of a Dalit woman in Balrampur district of Uttar Pradesh. On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh Congress Chief Ajay Kumar Lallu said there was lawlessness in the state after he was placed under house-arrest. Ninety-two former civil servants have also written to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath, expressing concern at the brazen violation of the rule of law in the state in connection with the Hathras gangrape case.

1," Viduthalai Siruthaigal Katchi MP Thol Thirumavalavan demand to ban the Manusmirti, the ancient book of Hindu laws, have sparked a row with the members of Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking his apology for his alleged remark that Manusmriti denigrated women. BJP workers on Tuesday staged agitations across Tamil Nadu demanding that Thirumavalavan apologise for his remark. The VCK cadres countered it by flash protests and they allegedly attacked saffron party office-bearers at Madurai. Actor Khushbhu, who quit Congress and joined BJP earlier this month, was arrested by the Chengalpet police on Tuesday while on her way to Chidambaram to take part in a protest against Thol Thirumavalvan. The VCK leader has been booked by Chennai Police on Friday after a complaint by the BJP. He faces charges under various IPC sections relating to the outraging of religious feeling, the vilification of religion, causing alarm to the public and others. Thol.Thirumavalavan on Saturday participated in a protest held in Valluvar Kottam in Chennai and said, The Manusmriti that divides humans and demeans women should be banned. On September 27, Periyarists in Europe conducted a webinar and I gave a 45 minutes speech. A few groups edited out five minutes from the forty minute video and claimed that I am demeaning women. The Hindutva groups are circulating the false message against me. He added that leaders like Periyar, MC Raja and Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti. Now a century later, VCK is reiterating the demand to ban Manusmriti. Explaining his words, Thirumavalavan said that he was not demeaning women and requested women from all segments to listen to the entire speech. He also thanked democratic forces and parties who extended support for the protest. VCK allies including the DMK and Congress have supported Thirumavalavan. In a statement, DMK president MK Stalin said, Thirumavalavan spoke citing Sanatana-Varnashrama-Manusmriti texts that demean women. This is the outcome of the awareness created by Thanthai Periyar and Ambedkar It is condemnable that police instead of taking action against the communal groups that has twisted the statement of Thirumavalavan took action against the VCK leader himself.

Two important members of By Special Correspondent Mumbai : Over 150 citizens from all walks of life on Tuesday condemned outright the hounding of intellectuals, poets and actors, both Javed Akhtar and Naseeruddin Shah","Viduthalai Siruthaigal Katchi MP Thol Thirumavalavan demand to ban the Manusmirti, the ancient book of Hindu laws, have sparked a row with the members of Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seeking his apology for his alleged remark that Manusmriti denigrated women. BJP workers on Tuesday staged agitations across Tamil Nadu demanding that Thirumavalavan apologise for his remark. The VCK cadres countered it by flash protests and they allegedly attacked saffron party office-bearers at Madurai. Actor Khushbhu, who quit Congress and joined BJP earlier this month, was arrested by the Chengalpet police on Tuesday while on her way to Chidambaram to take part in a protest against Thol Thirumavalvan. The VCK leader has been booked by Chennai Police on Friday after a complaint by the BJP. He faces charges under various IPC sections relating to the outraging of religious feeling, the vilification of religion, causing alarm to the public and others. Thol.Thirumavalavan on Saturday participated in a protest held in Valluvar Kottam in Chennai and said, The Manusmriti that divides humans and demeans women should be banned. On September 27, Periyarists in Europe conducted a webinar and I gave a 45 minutes speech. A few groups edited out five minutes from the forty minute video and claimed that I am demeaning women. The Hindutva groups are circulating the false message against me. He added that leaders like Periyar, MC Raja and Ambedkar burnt the Manusmriti. Now a century later, VCK is reiterating the demand to ban Manusmriti. Explaining his words, Thirumavalavan said that he was not demeaning women and requested women from all segments to listen to the entire speech. He also thanked democratic forces and parties who extended support for the protest. VCK allies including the DMK and Congress have supported Thirumavalavan. In a statement, DMK president MK Stalin said, Thirumavalavan spoke citing Sanatana-Varnashrama-Manusmriti texts that demean women. This is the outcome of the awareness created by Thanthai Periyar and Ambedkar It is condemnable that police instead of taking action against the communal groups that has twisted the statement of Thirumavalavan took action against the VCK leader himself. Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani also extended his support to Thirumavalavan appeal to ban the Manusmriti. ",722.25,english

The three girls are sisters, and were asleep on the top floor of their home in the village of Paraspur when the attack took place at around 1.30am. The two younger girls, aged eight and 12, received minor injuries while the eldest, 17, suffered disfiguring wounds to her face. All three have been admitted to the local hospital for treatment. Police told The Independent that they are investigating the possibility that the attacker was known to the family. The Additional Superintendent of the Gonda district police, Mahendra Kumar, said they have four teams working on the case and await the statement of the girls to proceed with their investigation. While the family has alleged it was an acid attack, Kumar said the police are yet to identify which chemical was used in the attack and are carrying out a forensic examination. The father of the girls, Ram Avatar, said in a statement to the police and local media that he was sleeping on the verandah while the three girls were asleep on the roof of the house on Monday night. When my daughters screamed, I immediately opened the door and grabbed one of them. When my vest burned, I got to know that somebody had thrown acid at them, he told a local TV news channel. The father said the family had no animosity with anyone else in the village, and he could not think why his daughters would be attacked. Uttar Pradesh state is already at the centre of national tensions surrounding the rape and murder of a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras, a case which has dominated the news amid allegations of police mishandling the case and targeting protesters with arrest.

They comprise about 16 per cent of the total Indian population according to the 2011 census.

It is a major honor to be able to participate in this press conference highlighting the need for solidarity between Dalit people in India and black people in the U.S., in conjunction with the campaign protesting the sexual assault and murder of a young Dalit woman in Uttar Pradesh and, of course, the many victims of violence enabled and condoned by the State. As Dalit activists and intellectuals have pointed out, the history of making connections between our two communities stretches back to the 19th century when most U.S. black people were enslaved. We deeply appreciate the solidarity that has been generated on so many occasions by Dalit activists. However, we must also be critical, self-critical, of our own failure to produce meaningful and transformative solidarity with Dalit people. Most recently, Dalit feminists have on several occasions made passionate calls for solidarity, especially with their efforts to resist the interminable assaults, particularly assaults involving sexual violence, against Dalit women. And so, we salute those who are standing up to resist casteism and patriarchy, capitalism. As we here in the United States attempt to move forward in our struggles against structural racism, and state and vigilante violence, we thank you for your solidarity and recognize that it is our responsibility to join you. We need to express our rage against racial, sexual and caste-based violence in India, and we need to demand justice for the victims, the survivors, and their families. This is a time when the world is beginning to rise together to demand justice for those who are targeted by white supremacists and casteists. Therefore, we stand with those who are issuing a global cry for an end to racism and who not only say black lives matter but also Dalit lives matter and Muslim lives matter. We protest the consolidation of casteist and fundamentalist religious forces against Dalits in the service of a fascist state, where a violent form of hindutva is deployed in order to bolster capitalism.

1,"HOT: Greek Ambassador: Bulgaria is our Most Important Economic and Trade partner in the Region #AmbassadorTalks  On January 6, Bulgaria marks 172 years since the birth of the Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev. Celebrations will take place across the country, BNT reported. In many places in the country, together with marking Botev birth, church celebrations will be held for water blessings of the military units and flags, which will be followed by the ceremony for retrieving the cross from rivers on Epiphany. Celebrations to mark Hristo Botev birth will take place in his birth town of Kalofer, in Sofia, Stara Zagora, Plovdiv, Haskovo, Blagoevgrad, Veliko Turnovo, Varna and Burgas. Botev was born in Kalofer in 1848. His father was a teacher and one of the most significant figures in the late period of the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1863, after completing his elementary education in Kalofer, Botev was sent by his father to a high school in Odessa, where he studied for 2 years. During this period, his ties to the Russian revolutionary movement and his political views began to form. In 1867, he returned to Kalofer to teach in place of his ill father. In May, he made a public speech against the Ottoman authorities, which led to his exile and move to Romania seeking asylum. From 1869 to 1871, Botev worked again as a teacher in Bessarabia, keeping close relations with the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and its leaders. In June 1871, he became editor of the revolutionary emigrant newspaper ""Word of the Bulgarian Emigrants"", where he published early poetic works. He closely collaborated with the Russian revolutionists and worked for the Russian newspaper Svoboda (Liberty).

Google Street View is again on its way through Bulgaria Bulgaria has the Largest Gray Economy in Europe","HOT: Greek Ambassador: Bulgaria is our Most Important Economic and Trade partner in the Region #AmbassadorTalks  On January 6, Bulgaria marks 172 years since the birth of the Bulgarian poet and revolutionary Hristo Botev. Celebrations will take place across the country, BNT reported. In many places in the country, together with marking Botev birth, church celebrations will be held for water blessings of the military units and flags, which will be followed by the ceremony for retrieving the cross from rivers on Epiphany. Celebrations to mark Hristo Botev birth will take place in his birth town of Kalofer, in Sofia, Stara Zagora, Plovdiv, Haskovo, Blagoevgrad, Veliko Turnovo, Varna and Burgas. Botev was born in Kalofer in 1848. His father was a teacher and one of the most significant figures in the late period of the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1863, after completing his elementary education in Kalofer, Botev was sent by his father to a high school in Odessa, where he studied for 2 years. During this period, his ties to the Russian revolutionary movement and his political views began to form. In 1867, he returned to Kalofer to teach in place of his ill father. In May, he made a public speech against the Ottoman authorities, which led to his exile and move to Romania seeking asylum. From 1869 to 1871, Botev worked again as a teacher in Bessarabia, keeping close relations with the Bulgarian revolutionary movement and its leaders. In June 1871, he became editor of the revolutionary emigrant newspaper ""Word of the Bulgarian Emigrants"", where he published early poetic works. He closely collaborated with the Russian revolutionists and worked for the Russian newspaper Svoboda (Liberty). In 1873, he worked on the satiric newspaper Alarm Clock and published political fiction aimed at wealthy Bulgarians.

1,"Print Thousands of Bulgarians held a fourth day of protests in Sofia and several other cities on July 12 against government corruption and said more similar rallies are scheduled to take place July 13 ahead of another nationwide protest later in the week. Thousands of people filled a central area in Sofia near the presidency and the Council of Ministers demanding the resignation of the conservative government. Protests also took place in Burgas, Plovdiv, Varna, Blagoevgrad, and Gabrovo, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty reporter. In Sofia, Burgas, and Varna, the protests turned into marches, with people shouting ""Resign!,"" ""Mafia!,"" and demanding the ouster of Prosecutor-General Ivan Geshev. The protests were sparked by a raid on July 9 by the Prosecutor-General's Office on the presidential headquarters. President Rumen Radev's legal affairs and anti-corruption secretary and his security and defense adviser were detained for questioning and their offices searched as part of two separate probes into influence-peddling and disclosure of state secrets. Demonstrations The searches sparked public anger and brought thousands of demonstrators onto the streets of Sofia to condemn the raids as an attack by the government and the prosecutor-general against Radev. Radev responded two days later by calling on the government and the prosecutor-general to step down. The searches came after Radev said the National Protection Service (NSO) -- which is responsible for guarding the president, prime minister, and other high officials -- should stop protecting Ahmed Dogan, the honorary chairman of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms (DPS). Protesters were also angered when people were barred from a state beach located near Dogan summer residence.

Radev is an outspoken critic of the cabinet of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, accusing it of ""links with oligarchs.""

1,"Print SOFIA -- Anti-government protesters returned to the streets of the Bulgarian capital, Sofia, pressing demands for the resignation of the government and the prosecutor-general. The rally on September 10 marked the 64th consecutive day of protests against the ruling conservative GERB party and its government in the Southeastern European nation deepening political crisis. Protesters, monitored closely by police, gathered outside the National Assembly building in Sofia, shouting, Mafia out! and demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Boyko Borisov government and Prosecutor-General Ivan Geshev. The September 10 rally appeared to take place without major incident. On September 2-3, several thousand people joined the so-called Grand National Uprising in response to what protesters say is oligarchic control over Bulgaria government and judicial system. Violence on that day led to scores of injuries and the arrest of 126 people, including what police described as more than 60 football hooligans. Opinion polls show that more than 60 percent of Bulgarians support demands for Borisov and Geshev to resign and for immediate parliamentary elections to be called. Borisov has said he is prepared to step down following parliamentary elections currently set for March 2021. On July 21, Borisov government survived a no-confidence vote in parliament, the fifth such vote since it took power in 2017. The demonstrators have protested against Borisov's government over perceived ties to the country powerful oligarchs. They also claim that Geshev has targeted government critics, including Socialist-backed President Rumen Radev, who has supported the protests.

Washington and Baghdad should not discuss troop withdrawal, the US State Department has said, refusing parliament's request for US soldiers to leave. Protesters in Iraq urged both the US and Iran to stop their meddling.   After Iraqi lawmakers voted to oust US troops, the US State Department dismissed their demand and said Washington and Baghdad should instead focus on fixing their alliance. ""Any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership  not to discuss troop withdrawal,"" spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Friday. The US, which invaded Iraq and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein in 2003, currently has some 5,200 soldiers on Iraqi soil. The troops are training and assisting Iraqi forces in the fight against the remnants of the defeated ""Islamic State"" (IS) militia. On Friday, the State Department said the US forces were crucial for the anti-IS effort and would not discuss removing them. Instead, the two sides should talk about ""our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East,"" the US said. Iraqi militia head killed alongside Soleimani The latest row between Iraq and the US was triggered by a US drone attack near Baghdad airport which killed Iran's General Qassem Soleimani and powerful Iraqi militia head Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. In a non-binding vote on Sunday, the Iraqi parliament passed a resolution asking the US troops to leave and asking the Iraqi government to formally demand a US withdrawal. In an apparent blunder, the US military's Task Force Iraq pledged to ""prepare for onward movement"" of US troops ""in deference to the sovereignty of the Republic of Iraq"" in a letter sent on Monday. However, the US officials were quick to dismiss the message as a ""draft"" that was sent by mistake. Several top US military officials have said there were no plans for US forces to withdraw. Iraq's caretaker prime minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi then presented the request to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a phone call on Thursday night. Between rock and hard place Also on Friday, protesters gathered in Baghdad and southern Iraq to demand that both Iran and the US stop meddling in Iraqi politics. Both Washington and Tehran are nominally allies of the Baghdad government. Iran is ruled by Shiite clerics who also exert a large influence on the Shiite majority in Iraq. The US also has many instruments to pressure the Iraqi officials, including waivers on sanctions against Iran. Washington currently allows Iraq to import Iranian gas despite sanctions, but the arrangement is set to expire in February. Iraq is also home to large Sunni and Kurdish populations, which oppose the idea of a US withdrawal and see US forces as a shield against unchecked power of Shiite factions. dj/msh (AP, Reuters, AFP) Every evening, DW sends out a selection of the day's news and features.

1,"Iraqi leaders have called for the removal of US troops from the country following the drone attack that killed Iranian military leader Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi military commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.

""The suicide attackers who forced the Americans to leave from our region in the past are still here and their numbers have increased,"" Nasrallah said. Also, a former leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guard suggests that the Israeli city of Haifa and ""centers"" like Tel Aviv could be targeted following the death of Soleimani in the US strike. Soleimani's death is being called a ""significant blow"" to Iran. The US knew that Soleimani was behind the recent attack on the US embassy in Baghdad and Defense Secretary Mark Esper had issued a warning saying on MSNBC, ""Enough is enough. We have all the capabilities to either respond to further attacks or take preemptive action if additional attacks are being prepared."" ""What happened was a political assassination. Iraq cannot accept this,"" Abdul-Mahdi said during an address to the parliament. US officials have made it clear they are prepared to meet any response from Iran. Did you know?

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was asked shortly before the parliamentary vote whether the US would comply with the request for American troops to leave. ""We'll watch. We're following very closely what's taking place in the Iraqi Parliament,"" Pompeo told ""Face the Nation."" ""It is the United States that is prepared to help the Iraqi people get what it is they deserve and continue our mission there to take down terrorism from ISIS and others in the region."" .@DrSJaishankar and I spoke just now regarding Iran continued threats and provocations. The Trump Administration wont hesitate to act to keep American lives, and those of our friends and allies, safe.  Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) January 5, 2020 Around 5,000 American troops are based in Iraq, where they mainly train Iraqi forces and help to combat the Islamic State. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah vowed to end the US military's presence in the Middle East, saying U.S. bases, warships and soldiers are now fair targets. ""The suicide attackers who forced the Americans to leave from our region in the past are still here and their numbers have increased,"" Nasrallah said. Also, a former leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guard suggests that the Israeli city of Haifa and ""centers"" like Tel Aviv could be targeted following the death of Soleimani in the US strike. Soleimani's death is being called a ""significant blow"" to Iran. The US knew that Soleimani was behind the recent attack on the US embassy in Baghdad and Defense Secretary Mark Esper had issued a warning saying on MSNBC, ""Enough is enough. We have all the capabilities to either respond to further attacks or take preemptive action if additional attacks are being prepared."" ""What happened was a political assassination. Iraq cannot accept this,"" Abdul-Mahdi said during an address to the parliament. US officials have made it clear they are prepared to meet any response from Iran. ",760.25,english

After the horrific incident, the community members of Keimoes and environs went on rampage burning and destroying properties belonging to foreign nationals, Nigerians in particular. These attacks spread to Upington and Nigerians and other foreign nationals were also expelled from Upington.

1,"Among the most alleged images in history is that of James Brock, the motel manager, who poured acid into the pool where black people were swimming. The photo was taken by Horace Cort at the Monson Motor Lodge swimming pool on 18th of June 1964. In reality, the famous photo shows a group of black and white inclusionists during a 1964 protest. The demonstration was related to the St. Augustine Campaign, named after the town where it took place in Florida. Violent reactions have resulted in many peaceful protests and marches and tricky protests. On June 11, 1964, after being requested to leave its secluded restaurant, Martin Luther King, Jr was arrested for infringement at Monson Motor Lodge. This led a number of black and white demonstrators to jump into the pool as a planned strategy to end racial in the White Only motel pools. White people who were paying for motel rooms welcomed blacks to join them as their guests in the motel pool. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his colleagues organized this swimming. In an attempt to disconnect the party, Jimmy Brock, Motel Manager, poured a bottle of Muriatic Acid into the swimming pool and eventually left the building. One of the swimmers, who knew the acid-to-pool ratio was so high that it was not a threat to them, was drinking a handful of pool water to sooth the fears of other swimmers. Numerous people from that time remember Brock in the acid incident as being more the victim. What the protesters heard, however, was the word acid It was nervous to everyone but finally convinced others to not be afraid because the amount of acid was small to the amount of water in the pool. And then a policeman jumped in to have the demonstrators arrested. After the incident, in this acid incident, many people from that time believed that James Brock was more the victim. That unfortunate event has left an unwanted and indelible legacy. The brunt of this kind was caught by Jimmy. He has been a good man, said his long-standing friend and fellow hotelier, Eddy Mussallem. They had to choose a hotel, so Jimmy hotel was chosen. I told him he did a dumb thing every time. The pressures on James Brock were placed on civil rights and militant whites to fight integration. In his house in St. Augustine Jimmy Brock died in 2007. He was just 85 years old. In March 2003, despite five years of protests, the Monson Motor Lodge and swimming pool were demolished, removing one of Civil Rights Movement country landmarks. On the site, a Hotel Hilton was constructed. Credit: atchuup The African History is a reliable blog site dedicated to sharing African Culture and History.

The photo was taken by Horace Cort at the Monson Motor Lodge swimming pool on 18th of June 1964. In reality, the famous photo shows a group of black and white inclusionists during a 1964 protest. The demonstration was related to the St. Augustine Campaign, named after the town where it took place in Florida. Violent reactions have resulted in many peaceful protests and marches and tricky protests. On June 11, 1964, after being requested to leave its secluded restaurant, Martin Luther King, Jr was arrested for infringement at Monson Motor Lodge. This led a number of black and white demonstrators to jump into the pool as a planned strategy to end racial in the White Only motel pools. White people who were paying for motel rooms welcomed blacks to join them as their guests in the motel pool. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and his colleagues organized this swimming. In an attempt to disconnect the party, Jimmy Brock, Motel Manager, poured a bottle of Muriatic Acid into the swimming pool and eventually left the building. One of the swimmers, who knew the acid-to-pool ratio was so high that it was not a threat to them, was drinking a handful of pool water to sooth the fears of other swimmers. Numerous people from that time remember Brock in the acid incident as being more the victim. What the protesters heard, however, was the word acid It was nervous to everyone but finally convinced others to not be afraid because the amount of acid was small to the amount of water in the pool. And then a policeman jumped in to have the demonstrators arrested. After the incident, in this acid incident, many people from that time believed that James Brock was more the victim. That unfortunate event has left an unwanted and indelible legacy. The brunt of this kind was caught by Jimmy. He has been a good man, said his long-standing friend and fellow hotelier, Eddy Mussallem. They had to choose a hotel, so Jimmy hotel was chosen. I told him he did a dumb thing every time. The pressures on James Brock were placed on civil rights and militant whites to fight integration. In his house in St. Augustine Jimmy Brock died in 2007. He was just 85 years old. In March 2003, despite five years of protests, the Monson Motor Lodge and swimming pool were demolished, removing one of Civil Rights Movement country landmarks. On the site, a Hotel Hilton was constructed. Credit: atchuup The African History is a reliable blog site dedicated to sharing African Culture and History.

According to the Gallup poll, released on August 6, 2015, even though the African American community was split on whether police treat them fairly, a total of 92 per cent of poll respondents indicated they are either comfortable with the current number of police or would prefer additional police. 33 per cent of African Americans want a higher police presence in their community, and interestingly, of those African Americans who specifically believe that they are treated unfairly by police, 44 per cent want a larger police presence in their community. 59 per cent of African Americans want the current number of police to be maintained, leaving only 8 per cent calling for less police. This is also true for white and Hispanic Americans. Among whites, 94 per cent want the same or more police, and among Hispanics, 95 per cent want the same or more police. These results appear not to have changed wildly in the intervening five years, as a now famous YouGov poll reveals that despite the constant haranguing of Black Lives Matter protesters across the country, only 16 per cent of Americans want the police to be defunded: Despite calls by activists and protesters to defund police departments, most Americans do not support reducing law enforcement budgets. Close to two-thirds (65%) oppose cutting police force funding. Just 16 percent of Democrats and 15 percent of Republicans support that idea. While the number of those who want less or defunded police has grown from 7 per cent to 16 per cent in five years, it remains a minority view only held by a select few. As was indicated in 2015, there is, however, bipartisan support for expanding police education and resources when it comes to deescalating conflicts, identifying potential bad police officers, and increasing to use of body cameras to record the behavior of police and the public they interact with. © 2022 NationalFile.com National File, LLC.

A convoy of cars and trucks from the Kahnawake Mohawk community turned out Sunday afternoon in a show of solidarity with Indigenous fishers in southwestern Nova Scotia. In the latest incident in an escalating crisis over Indigenous fishing treaty rights, a suspicious fire early Saturday gutted a lobster pound in which Mikmaq fishers in Middle West Pubnico, N.S., had been storing their catches. The 39 vehicles in the convoy, several displaying large flags including the Six Nations flag and the Warrior society flag, started out shortly after 1 p.m., creating a sort of rolling blockade as they drove through Kahnawake. They headed along Highway 132 toward St-Constant before turning around and returning along Highway 132, under the Mercier Bridge and then up Highway 138. The Kahnawake Mohawk Peacekeepers provided an escort car at the front of the convoy and another at the rear, said Constable Kyle Zachary of the Kahnawake police force. The highways remained open, but the convoy caused an intentional slowdown to draw attention to the situation, he said. The blaze in Middle West Pubnico was set days after raids on two facilities in the province, where Mikmaq fishers were storing their catches, by several hundred commercial fishermen and their supporters to protest against a moderate livelihood lobster fishery launched by the Sipeknekatik First Nation last month, outside the federally mandated commercial season. A Digby County man was charged on Friday after an assault on Sipeknekatik First Nation Chief Mike Sack Wednesday. On Saturday, Sack called for military support to prevent commercial fishermen from taking the law into their own hands. sschwartz@postmedia.com Sign up to receive daily headline news from the Montreal Gazette, a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

Wissam and his family, like many thousands of Christian families who live on the Nineveh Plains, fled the 2014 ISIS invasion of the region and spent several years living in Erbil, Kurdistan. He spoke with Aid to the Church in Need: Everyone here knows that August 6, 2014 was a dark and painful day in Iraqi Christian history: we were subjected to violence, persecution, and forced displacement at the hands of ISIS. Those who could not escape remained in its grip. My family and I were lucky. We fled, leaving our possessions and money behind. We clung to our faith and asked Jesus for help. Our first stop was a hosting station in Kurdistan. We stayed there until we could find a more suitable place to live; we later moved to Erbil so I could finish my studies. In 2017, I graduated from the University of Mosulwhich had a facility in Erbilwith a degree in Business Administration. Hope still exists for us. Terrorists were expelled from the Nineveh Plains, so we were able to return to our home despite the damage done to it. In any case, we could not have stayed in Kurdistan, where the cost of living is too high and we could not find steady employment there. Baashiqah is currently stable, and we have the protection of the Iraqi army and the local police force. But we still feel insecure in many ways. There is no justice or equality for Christians here; unemployment rates are high here, too. And the ISIS occupation has left a legacy of distrust between Christians and Muslims in the region. I would prefer emigrating today. Im a university graduate but I am making just $200 a month working in a juice shop. My ambition was to get a government position and to have a chance at a stable job The future is unknown and that does frighten me. The country is going through endless conflicts; and the power of militia and the influence of Iran rob Iraq of its sovereignty. We have been persecuted for our faith and will likely continue to be. But we remain attached to our faith at all costs and hope that peace will prevail in the end. I hope that future generations of Christians can fulfill their responsibility to build a stable Iraqi society, one in which Christians can play a significant role. Meanwhile, I am grateful for the Church and the various youth programs it runs, teaching the faith as well as basic computer skills and English.

A 13-year-old Dalit girl in Khammam district of Telangana is battling for her life after she was set on fire allegedly by her employer's son for resisting his sexual advances. The minor girl has sustained 70% burn injuries. Though the incident took place on September 18, it came to light on Monday after the girl disclosed the incident to her parents. According to the police, the victim, a native of Pallegudem village, Khammam district, was working as a domestic help at the house of Allam Subbarao. On September 18, Subbaro's son, Allam Maraiah, allegedly tried to rape her. However, as she refused to give in, Maraiah set her on fire and fled from the spot, police said. The victim was then admitted in a private hospital for treatment by Subbarao's family, and they tried to bury the incident. A few days ago, the family told the victim's parents that their daughter suffered injuries while doing work. Her father immediately rushed to the hospital. However, as the victim was in an unconscious state, she could not reveal the crime. Fortunately, the victim regained consciousness on Monday, and shared the entire incident to her father. Subsequently, he filed a complaint with the One Town police station. She reportedly told her father, ""When I was in the room, he came inside and asked me to sleep with him. When I refused, he forced himself on me. I struggled a lot. He tore my clothes and later set me ablaze and ran away from the place.""

Jaisalmer: Three Dalit youths were assaulted after being accused of stealing donkeys in Jaisalmer district, the third such incident to come to light in Rajsthan in recent days. Five persons have been arrested and three detained after a video of the incident surfaced, police said on Sunday. The incident occurred on February 15 in Rama village of Fatehgarh tehsil of the district. The youths were thrashed with sticks and kicked by nearly a dozen people for stealing donkeys. They were later handed over to Sangarh police. ""Five persons have been arrested and three minors have been detained so far. A case has been registered in the matter under sections of SC/ST Act and further investigation in the matter is on,"" Station House Officer (SHO) of Sangarh police station Ugam Raj Soni said. Similar incidents had come to light in Nagaur and Barmer. A chilling video of a man being beaten up brutally in Barmer allegedly for committed a theft had gone viral here, prompting the police to arrest a man and detain another on Friday for their alleged roles in the crime. The video surfaced on Thursday close on the heels of brutal assault on two Dalit youths on similar allegation of theft in Nagaur. The Barmer incident occurred on January 29. Police have arrested at least seven persons in connection with the Nagaur case which occurred on February 16. The Dalit men were beaten up, stripped and tortured by staffers of a motorcycle service agency in Karanu village after accusing them of committing theft. In the video, a group of men is seen thrashing two persons with rubber belts. They later dipped a piece of cloth wrapped on a screwdriver in petrol and inserted it in the private parts of one of the victims. The incidents have triggered a political storm in Rajasthan with the BJP attacking the ruling Congress. Union minister Arjun Ram Meghwal has alleged that the Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government is unable to rein in crime in Rajasthan. Meghwal, who is an MP from Bikaner, had accused the police of manipulating the Nagaur case.","Representative image.

0,"Dangerous working conditions, debt bondage and below minimum wages are some of the findings of the study Between a rock and a hard place released by the Dutch-based human rights NGO Arisa. In the quarries surveyed in Rajasthan, it was found that over 60% of the workers were Adivasis or Dalits. The study identified key concerns in the quarries including a lack of contracts for most workers who were paid on a piece-rate basis and below minimum wage, especially female workers. Health and safety of the workers was also found to be extremely compromised by the lack of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) with 72% of the workers interviewed reporting that they are not provided any PPE by the quarry management. This puts the workers at a high risk of the lung disease Silicosis, for which there is no cure. Other safety concerns stated in the report include explosions, moving and falling stones, dust, and backbreaking labour. In 60% of the sample quarries visited clean drinking water is lacking and except for a few big quarries, there are no toilet facilities for the workers; they use the open area in and around the quarry, which is an unacceptable situation, especially for women. Debt bondage was also identified in the study as an area of concern, with many workers having to take advances or loans in order to survive, which they then have to work to pay back. Most of the workers do not have contracts and advances and loans are also often not in writing. Nearly 40% of the workers in the study were found to be illiterate making it very difficult for them to keep control of when their advances and debts have been repaid. Interest on loans was found to range from 24% to 36% per year. On a more positive note, the study finds that progress has been made in reducing child labour in the industry, especially in quarries. Children were however still found to be working in home-based stonework. IDSN welcomes the study and urges companies to address the issues identified urgently, including looking at the marginalisation of Dalits and Adivasis as a key contributor to their exploitation in the sector. The study gives a number of key recommendations to companies. Arisa has approached 112 identified global companies sourcing stone from Rajasthan to initiate a dialogue process with them.

The alleged rape and subsequent death of a 19-year-old woman in India has again shone a spotlight on caste-based violence against the Dalit community formerly known as untouchables. According to official figures, men from India's upper castes rape ten Dalit women a day. Although the northern state of Uttar Pradesh records the highest number of such cases, caste-based violence and discrimination is prevalent throughout the country and in Indian communities around the world. Dalits make up nearly twenty percent of India's population and were given equal protection under the constitution after independence from Britain. But rights groups say while many Dalits have been able to take advantage of quota systems to move up the economic ladder, violence and discrimination against the community is worsening. The current racial justice movement in the United States is inspiring Dalit activists to be move assertive in speaking up for their rights but what gains can Dalits expect to make?

0,"Discover Thomson Reuters By Kirsty Needham 3 Min Read SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has cautioned China against attempts at economic coercion as Australia pushes for an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic that China opposes. Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the Chinese public could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. Maybe the ordinary people will say Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef? Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have second thoughts about visiting Australia. The parents of the students would also think ... whether this is the best place to send their kids, he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a principled call for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation, Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an honest assessment of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO role. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed calls for an investigation during a daily briefing in Beijing, though not commenting specifically about Australia. China is the first country to report a COVID case, but it doesnt mean the virus originated in China, he told reporters. Some people are trying to hype up the so-called investigation that is inconsistent with an international atmosphere of cooperation and their political manoeuvring will not succeed. The novel coronavirus has infected 2.97 million people worldwide and killed more than 205,000, a Reuters tally shows.

We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment, when what we need is global cooperation, Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in travelling to Australia. Payne said an honest assessment of the pandemic would seek to strengthen the WHO role. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang dismissed calls for an investigation during a daily briefing in Beijing, though not commenting specifically about Australia. China is the first country to report a COVID case, but it doesnt mean the virus originated in China, he told reporters. Some people are trying to hype up the so-called investigation that is inconsistent with an international atmosphere of cooperation and their political manoeuvring will not succeed. The novel coronavirus has infected 2.97 million people worldwide and killed more than 205,000, a Reuters tally shows.

0,"NATO is considering an increase to its training mission in Iraq to relieve the burden on the US-led coalition against Daesh, senior officials and diplomats said on Tuesday, Reuters reports. NATO and the coalition have non-combat ""train-and-advise"" missions which aim to develop Iraqi security forces but both are suspended over fears for regional stability after a US drone strike killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad on Jan. 3. After the killing, US President Donald Trump called on NATO founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union to do more in the Middle East but he has not specified publicly what that might entail. NATO defence ministers including US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper will discuss options for non-combat operations in the Middle East at a two-day meeting in Brussels starting on Wednesday, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. ""We are discussing what more NATO can do,"" he told reporters, adding that the alliance would first seek to restart the training with the Iraqi government's blessing. READ: Support for NATO plummeting in Europe, lowest in Turkey US Ambassador to NATO Kay Bailey Hutchison said the alliance was also seeking military advice, both from NATO and Iraq, on how to increase the mission, but gave no details. ""I think it will definitely be the answer to what President Trump has requested,"" she said. Established in Baghdad in October 2018, the NATO training mission in Iraq numbers some 500 personnel. It does not deploy alongside Iraqi forces during their operations. Two allied diplomats told Reuters the number of NATO trainers in Iraq could rise to as much as 2,000, but it would not be a net increase of Western troops in Iraq because the US-led coalition would simply re-assign trainers. While symbolic, the coalition is outside NATO structures. Putting more personnel under a NATO flag would solidify training in Iraq and could make it more long-term, also cementing NATO's presence in the region. When Trump first raised increasing NATO's role in the Middle East in 2017, France and Germany resisted, worried that NATO would be caught up in another costly, Afghan-style deployment, anger Arab countries or risk confrontation with Russia in Syria. But diplomats said Paris and Berlin were now open to an expanded NATO mission in Iraq because it was non-combat, held fewer risks, would not be under a US general's command and would go some way to mollifying Trump, a sharp critic of NATO.

As the fight showed no sign of flagging, the elders of one of the boys, dominant caste as it turned out, decided to get involved. The Dalit boy, after all, had to be shown his place. The men from the dominant caste caught hold of the Dalit boy mother. They stripped her and paraded her through the village. The woman mother and daughter tried to intervene and were thrashed. Finally, the village sarpanch stepped in and a bystander offered the woman a shawl. An FIR was filed, but the accused got bail. This story was narrated by the woman husband at a conference organised in New Delhi by the All India Dalit Mahila Adhikar Manch a few years ago. But the reality of living as a Dalit woman in India hasnt changed. Tucked inside the newspapers  if at all  it filters through stories of everyday, routine indignities. Somewhere a sarpanch is denied a chair on the podium during a Republic Day function. A bride palanquin takes the long route home so as to not pollute the roads that dominant castes tread on. Shopkeepers fling purchases made by Dalit customers. Temples and common water sources are barred. Just another day in the life of a Dalit. The outrage over Hathras is justified and necessary. But there is nothing new about the systemic oppression of Dalit women aided by State-backed institutions: The police who wont file FIRs, lawyers who urge rape survivors to compromise, a legal system that exhausts the patience of the most stoic victim, and a media that finds no merit in these stories. To say, dont make this about caste is ignorance and privilege. Of course, it is about caste. Of course, there is a power dynamic. Would there have been mere outrage and not a raging lynch mob if four Dalit men had attacked a Thakur woman in a similar fashion? Would the police have locked an upper caste family inside their home and denied them access to their daughter cremation? Caste is modern India dirtiest little secret. It has a grip so insidious that parents will kill their own daughters for falling in love with men from the wrong caste; a grip so normalised that in 2014, India biggest caste survey found one in four Indians freely admitted to practising some form of untouchability. Of all the ghastly visuals that emerged from Hathras, the one that broke my heart is the one where the sister-in-law of the 19-year-old Dalit girl is running behind the district magistrate official white car as he leaves the village in a plume of dust.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted Saturday that the Iranian-backed militia Kataeb Hezbollah is telling Iraqi security forces to abandon their ""duty to protect"" the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, and other locations where Americans work with Iraqis. ""Iranian-owned [Kataeb Hezbollah] thugs are telling Iraqi security forces to abandon their duty to protect [the U.S. Embassy Baghdad] and other locations where Americans work side by side with good Iraqi people,"" Pompeo said.

""The Iraqi people want out from under the Iranian yoke; indeed, they recently burned an Iranian consulate to the ground,"" Pompeo added. Last week, the U.S. military carried out airstrikes in Iraq and Syria -- days after a U.S. defense contractor was killed at a military compound in a rocket attack. U.S. officials have blamed the militia for a rocket barrage that killed a U.S. defense contractor, wounded four U.S. troops and two members of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) near Kirkuk, in northern Iraq. Military fighter jets conducted ""precision defensive strikes"" on five sites of Kataeb Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Iraqi militia, Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman had told Fox News. Two defense officials said U.S. Air Force F-15s carried out the strikes. On Saturday, President Trump issued a stern warning to Iran through a series of tweets to deter the country from retaliating after the U.S.-ordered airstrike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani on Thursday. Trump said the U.S. has targeted ""52 Iranian sites"" that the U.S. military will hit if Iran retaliates. Fox News' Nicole Darrah contributed to this report.

Global News Pakistan - Pakistan's Premier News Translation Agency BAGHDAD, 19 March 2020 (GNP) : Iraq president named little-known former regional governor Adnan al-Zurfi as prime minister-designate on Tuesday in another bid to overcome months of unrest and deadlock, but powerful Shiite blocs quickly lined up to reject his nomination. Zurfi now has 30 days to try and form a government which must then survive a vote of confidence in Iraq deeply divided parliament. He is the second man chosen to succeed Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned as prime minister in November amid mass anti-government protests. The next candidate, Mohammed Allawi, quit on March 1, accusing parties of obstructing him. Lawmakers told Reuters that President Barham Salih had named Zurfi only after larger rival Shiite political parties failed to agree on one candidate. Some of those same groups rounded on the new candidate, who is head of the small Nasr parliamentary group of former prime minister Haider al-Abadi, a U.S. ally. We hold the president fully responsible for the repercussions of these provocative steps, read a statement from the Fatih alliance, which represents mostly Iran-backed Shiite militia leaders in parliament. He an American joker and we reject him, said Hassan Salim, a lawmaker from Asaib Ahl al-Haq Iranian-backed group which the United States designated as a terrorist organization in January. Zurfi lived in the United States as a refugee in the 1990s after fleeing the regime of Saddam Hussein and is seen as a comparatively secular figure in a country long dominated by sectarian parties. After Saddam overthrow, he served as governor of the predominantly Shiite Najaf province during the U.S. occupation. Zurfi will have to deal with both the powerful Iran-backed groups and with protesters who have been camping out for months, demanding an overhaul of the whole political elite. President Salih called on Zurfi to work on holding early fair elections and to meet protests demands. Hours before the nomination, two rockets fell inside Basmaya military camp to the south of Baghdad, which houses U.S.-led coalition troops, without causing any damage on injuries.

He alleged that his teammates has called him names which was degrading to the black people. Recently I discovered a word that I was being called was not what it actually meant. I need some answers. So before I start calling out names, I need these individuals to reach out and please tell me there is another meaning to that word. I saw you as brothers. , Sammy wrote on Twitter. Sammy, after listening to Hassan Minhaj talking about how black people are called certain names in his culture, found out that he was being called the exact same word that degrades black people. After Darren Sammy post went viral and stormed up anger, his fans dug up an old Instagram post in 2014, by his team mate Ishant Sharma in which Sharma refers to Sammy as kaalu, which has a similar meaning to black man. Sammy explained how he had enjoyed being called that name because he had thought it meant something positive like strong. I will be messaging those people, you guys know who you are, I must admit at that time when I was being called using that word, I thought the word meant strong stallion or whatever it is, I did not know what it meant, every time I was called with that word, there was laughter at that moment, I thought teammates are happy, so it must be something funny, Sammy said.The name kaalu refers to his colour in a very contemptuous way like how nigger or negro does. The former West Indies skipper demanded an apology from his team mates for calling him by the name. But later he revealed that he had an interesting conversation with one of his former team mates in SRH about which he wrote on Twitter, Im pleased to say that Ive had a really interesting conversation with one of the guys and we are looking at ways to educate rather than focusing on the negatives.

0,"HOT: Greek Ambassador: Bulgaria is our Most Important Economic and Trade partner in the Region #AmbassadorTalks  Our embassy in Berlin was informed by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs that as part of the prevention against the coronavirus, measures are being prepared against those entering the country from three regions of Bulgaria - Varna, Blagoevgrad and Dobrich. The three regions will be declared at risk, and from Saturday, August 8, all arrivals from these regions will be subject to mandatory testing. A mandatory 14-day quarantine is in force for these citizens until the test result is received - the quarantine will be dropped after a negative sample. The test must be taken up to 72 hours after entering Germany. Testing is also allowed in the country of departure if it is performed by a certified laboratory and is up to 48 hours before arrival in Germany.

The National Commissioner of Police, General Khehla John Sitole, said authorities responded quickly to the mayhem. I am certain that the speedy response by the joint security forces has averted what could have been a more severe blood bath, Sitole said in a statement Saturday, according to I24 News. The news outlet described the building as a mega-church. Four people were found shot and burnt to death in a car while a fifth victim, a security guard, was also fatally shot in his car while he was apparently attending this complaint, Sitole added. An armed group stormed the International Pentecostal Holiness Church in Zuurbekom, located near Johannesburg. The police chief said that they were trying to take over the premises. Officials said they dont believe a terrorist organization is responsible, but they may have been motivated by a feud between conflicted parties of the church, ABC News reported. Police officials said they rescued multiple men, women, and children who were said to be living inside the church compound and were allegedly being held as hostages. Sitole added: It is rather unfortunate that such an incident takes place during a time when South Africa is being plagued by a deadly virus and violent crimes, referring to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) virus, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. In 2018, according to I24, there were reports of a shoot-out between two parties outside the church headquarters in Zuurbekom.

Led by a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) functionary in Gaya region, the group had camped about a mile off the disputed site. Oram since his arrival had shown signs of unrest. He had vowed to lay the foundation stone for a grand Ram temple at the site where Babri Masjid stood. Else, he would not return to his village. To avoid any untoward incident, Kameshwar Chaupal, the VHP joint general secretary in-charge of tribal-dominated districts in Bihar, was asked to keep a close watch on Oram. November 9, 1989 was the auspicious day chosen by top Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and VHP leaders to performs shilanyas and lay the foundation for the proposed grand temple at Ayodhya. It was to be the culmination of decade-long campaign led by the VHP and nurtured by the RSS. Early that Wednesday morning, VHP leader Ashok Singhal close aide Rameshwar came looking for Chaupal. At the shilanyas site, very close to the disputed structure, Chaupal was accorded the coveted seat beside Singhal. Swami Chinmayananda, who would go on to become a minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, was the master of the ceremony. With Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, seers and saints in attendance, the puja began. In a powerful political statement, from a bevy of gurus lined up for the event, the VHP had chosen a Dalit boy from Saharasa in Bihar to lay the foundation stone of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and of the BJP in national politics. Once Shilanyas was done, Kameshswar Chaupal left Ayodhya for his village in Bihar. On his arrival, Chaupal was told Baldev Jha, head of a prosperous Brahmin family had sent a message and wished to see him. We had lived under centuries of subjugation, and I was reluctant. But my father coaxed me to go and meet Baldev Babu, Chaupal recalled speaking to News18 in December, 2017. For a person who had never entered an Upper Caste household in his village, Chaupal was unsure of the reception he would receive. To my shock, Baldev Babu held my hand, made me sit beside him and asked everyone in the family, young and old, to touch my feet. They had read about me in the newspapers, he recalled. Chaupal later contested 1991 Lok Sabha elections from Rosada on BJP ticket, but lost. Chaupal tried his luck for the second time in 1995 Assembly polls. Five years later, he was nominated to the Bihar Legislative Council, where he served for two terms. Ahead of the 2014 general elections, JD(U) had broken its poll pact with the BJP.

Chaupal later contested 1991 Lok Sabha elections from Rosada on BJP ticket, but lost. Chaupal tried his luck for the second time in 1995 Assembly polls. Five years later, he was nominated to the Bihar Legislative Council, where he served for two terms. Ahead of the 2014 general elections, JD(U) had broken its poll pact with the BJP. It asked him to contest from a general seat. Chaupal lost to Pappu Yadav wife and Congress candidate Ranjeet Ranjan. ​",679.75,english

QH is one of a few armed factions which were formed or emerged following the assassination of Popular Mobilization Units Deputy Commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Iran Quds Force Commander Maj. Gen. Qassam Soleimani in January 2020. Usbat al-Thaireen (UT), the faction that claimed responsibility for the March 11 rocket attack on the US-operated military base Camp Taji, was among the first groups that became active after the incident. Another group is Ashab al-Kahf (AK). This group allegedly attacked a military convoy of U.S. forces in Saladin earlier this week. Other large Shiite armed group like Kataib Hezbollah (KH) have been threatening U.S. forces for a while now. However, they are yet to take any direct military action. The U.S.-led coalition has taken these threats seriously. It has withdrawn a large part of its troops and redeployed others to well-protected bases.

Kadhimi, who has been director of Iraq National Intelligence Service since 2016, pledged in a televised address April 9 to work tirelessly to present Iraqis with a program and Cabinet that will work to serve them, protect their rights and take Iraq toward a prosperous future. Iraqi President Barham Salih named Kadhimi as prime minister-designate after Adnan al-Zurfi, a former governor of Najaf, withdrew his candidacy. Kadhimi, who is not affiliated with any Iraqi political party, is the third candidate for the post since Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned in November 2019 in response to widespread anti-government protests. Prior to his appointment as intelligence director, Kadhimi worked as a journalist and was previously editor of Al-Monitor Iraq Pulse. Salih first choice, Mohammed Tawfiq Allawi, a former communications minister, withdrew March 1 after failing to reach agreement on a new Cabinet within 30 days. Kadhimi appears to have widespread backing for his candidacy among Iraq key political parties. Salih described Kadhimi as a patriot and cultural figure  well known for his integrity, moderation [and] giving consideration for all Iraqis regarding their general rights."" The United States and Iran both reacted relatively positively to Kadhimi appointment last week. US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker said April 9, If Kadhimi is an Iraqi nationalist, if he is dedicated to pursuing a sovereign Iraq, if he is committed to fighting corruption, this would be great for Iraq, and I think it would be great for our bilateral relationship. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi welcomed the consensus reached among Iraqi political groups today, resulting in the designation of Mr. al-Kadhimi as the new prime minister of Iraq, and considers it as a right step in the right direction.

Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Vice President Deepak Kumar met the survivor and alleged that the family was being threatened by the accused as well as the police. He said that he would give a detailed report on the matter to party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi and party state chief Ajay Kumar Lallu. Congress leader Sheoraj Jivan Valmiki, who also reached Hathras on Wednesday to meet the survivor's family members, has demanded action against police officers for delay in recording the statement, adding that injustice to the members of the Dalit community would not be tolerated.

0,"The family has filed a complaint against the caste Hindu man for allegedly abusing and asking the teen to eat his excreta. In yet another instance of caste violence during the lockdown in Tamil Nadu, a caste Hindu man allegedly told a 14-year-old Dalit boy to eat his own faeces and forced him to carry the excreta for five metres since the boy defecated on a patta land owned by the former. The incident reportedly took place in Pennagaram of Dharmapuri district. The landowner, Rajasekhar, also allegedly abused the Class 10 boy with casteist slurs and assaulted him with a cane to force him to carry the excreta to his house. Rajesekhar belongs to the Iyer caste while the boy is from the Adi Dravidar caste, a Scheduled Caste group in Tamil Nadu. Following the incident, the boy's father has given a complaint to the police, based on which a case has been registered under the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prevention of Atrocities Act. According to the First Information Report accessed by TNM, the 14-year-old defecated in the open at 5 pm on July 15 as it was raining, on a land owned by Rajasekhar. On seeing the boy defecate on his land, Rajasekhar allegedly told him to eat the faeces and carry it in his hands. Rajasekhar also hit the boy with a cane to make him carry the excreta to his house, the FIR says. Fearing assault, the boy reportedly collected the faeces and walked for five metres till he reached home, the FIR adds. The humiliated boy is still unable to eat due to the incident, says his father. Talking to TNM, the father says, âIt was raining heavily on July 15 and my son got an umbrella from me and left home for defecating in the open. We have a toilet constructed by the Central government but we do not have water, so we defecate in the open. On that day also, my child was defecating on the land owned by Rajasekhar, when he passed by that way. On seeing the child, he immediately got down from the vehicle and started hitting my son with a cane for defecating in the open.â âRajasekhar told my son to eat the faeces since he had defecated on his land. He also uttered a casteist slur to my boy and told him to pick up the excreta with his hands,â alleges the father. Though a passerby tried to help the boy, Rajasekhar reportedly did not permit it. However, the passerby informed the father about what was going on. âBy then, my son just picked up the faeces and ran to our home. When I saw him, I was shocked to see him carrying the faeces. I asked him why he was carrying it and he told me that Rajasekhar had hit him and that he could not bear the pain,â the father says. âI immediately washed his hands. But still my child has not had food since he gets reminded of carrying the faeces in his hand,â adds the father. The Pennagaram Inspector said that the case is being handled by Pennagaram Deputy Superintendent of Police, Mehala. However, the DSP was unavailable for comment. The police have registered a case against Rajesekhar under Section 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of Indian Penal Code and Section 3 (1) (i) of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.  ©2021 the news minute","The family has filed a complaint against the caste Hindu man for allegedly abusing and asking the teen to eat his excreta.

(Photo: FOX News) Eleven U.S. service members were flown out of Al Assad Air Base in Iraq and treated for concussion symptoms after Iran's rocket attack targeting two Iraqi military bases earlier this month, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command revealed Thursday night. President Trump and U.S. officials had said earlier that no Americans were killed or injured in the Jan. 8 attack.

The explosions at the base, about 110 miles west of Baghdad, created large craters, knocked over concrete barriers and destroyed facilities that house dozens of soldiers. The attack on the Al Assad base, where about 1,500 American and coalition forces are stationed, was carried out in retaliation for the killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Gen. Qassem Soleimani.

Ali Yousif Ahmed Al-Nouri, 42, is wanted in Iraq on charges of premeditated murder of the Iraqi police officers in 2006, according to a statement by the US Attorney Office District of Arizona. An Iraqi judge issued a warrant for Al-Nouri arrest and the government there issued an extradition request to the US Justice Department, the statement said. The Justice Department sought an arrest warrant for Al-Nouri and he was taken into custody on Thursday in Phoenix. He appeared before a federal magistrate judge in Phoenix on Friday in connection with proceedings to extradite him to Iraq, the statement said. According to the Iraqi government, Al-Nouri was the leader of an al-Qaeda group in Fallujah which planned operations targeting Iraqi police. The statement noted the details in the Iraqi complaint were allegations that had yet to been proven in court. Al-Nouri extradition would have to be certified by the US court and the US Secretary of State would then decide whether to surrender him to Iraq, the statement said.

Two rockets have struck a training base south of Baghdad where US-led coalition troops and NATO trainers are present, Iraq military has said. The attack, the third targeting military bases hosting foreign forces in a week, targeted the Besmaya base south of Baghdad on Monday night, read the statement, making no mention of casualties. Spanish forces linked to the US-led coalition fighting the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS), as well as NATO training forces, are present in Besmaya. Earlier on Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iraq that the US would retaliate as necessary against any new assaults on Americans. Since late October, there have been 24 rocket attacks on the US embassy in Baghdad or bases where foreign troops are deployed, killing three American military personnel, one British soldier and one Iraqi soldier. No attacks have been claimed but Washington has blamed Kataeb Hezbollah, a hardline faction in the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation Forces) state-sponsored military network. Iraq has long feared it would get caught in the spiralling tensions between Iran and the US, its two main allies.      Tensions between the two countries dramatically spiked in late 2019 when a US contractor was killed in a rocket attack on a separate base in northern Iraq, leading to retaliatory American strikes on Kataeb Hezbollah. Days later, a US drone strike killed Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani and Hashed deputy chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Iran launched ballistic missiles at US troops in Iraq while the Iraqi parliament voted to expel all foreign soldiers from its soil, a decision that has yet to be implemented. Some 5,200 American troops are based in Iraq as part of the US-led coalition. Top US military and civilian officials had long expressed frustration that Iraqs government was not doing enough to prevent rocket attacks targeting US troops and diplomats.

Fans in the Senegalese star's village of Bambali jumped up and down, waving shirts above their head after he beat Mohamed Salah and Riyad Mahrez to the prestigious award. It was the first time Mane, 27, has won the award - with Reds team-mate Salah winning the last two.

Their sheer size is mesmerizing, but it their other features that make them one of our favorite animals. They have big floppy ears, long tusks, and of course, their insanely long trunks. Most folks only think of elephant trunks as their nose. However, it turns out that this part of their body is much more complicated. An elephant trunk is actually a fusion of their upper lip and nose. It used for smelling, breathing, touching, grasping, and making those adorable elephant sounds we all love. This all-purpose snozz even helps elephants eat and drink. And yes, they eat and drink a lot. In fact, the average elephant eats between 100 and 200 pounds of plants every day. And they drink about 30 to 50 gallons of water daily! In couple in South Africa were having a private pool party in 2010, when they had an unexpected visitor stroll in and crash their party. It was a massive male African elephant who decided to come over and help himself to a little drink from their pool. Now, some folks were concerned that the pool was chlorinated. However, the uploader of the video assures us it was not. And besides, I highly doubt the elephant sensitive nose would have allowed it to drink from a chlorinated pool. Source: YouTube Watching this graceful animal move is fun to watch, they seem to have such precise control over their trunk, it looks like they could use it to do anything we can do with our hands!

0,"equine news, research, and information  Deadly African Horse Sickness has been detected in Thailand, killing at least 42 racehorses in the northeast of the country. The disease is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and is spread by biting midges. Horses are considered the most susceptible, with nearly 90% dying if infected. It kills roughly half of infected mules and 10% of donkeys. Infected African donkeys and mules rarely show signs of disease. The Thailand outbreak is understood to be the first time the disease has been confirmed in the country. It is centered in the Pak Chong area, according to the Thailand Equestrian Federation veterinary adviser, Dr Metha Chanda. Chanda told the International Equestrian Federation veterinary director, Dr Göran Akerström, in a letter on Saturday that the emergence of the disease had been confirmed by the country Department of Livestock Development (DLD). Authorities have suspended the movement of all horses and equine species within a 150km radius of the outbreak. People are required to report any sudden death or suspected cases to the DLD. Restricted movement and good hygiene must be followed among the horses located outside of the outbreak zone, Chanda says. Checkpoints will be watching for any illegal movements of equines. Further measures may be launched to minimize and control the outbreak of the disease, he says. Chanda says 42 horses have been reported dead so far out of 62 cases. He says 341 horses in the outbreak area are susceptible to the disease. He says the reaction of the Thailand Equestrian Federation has been swift, with members told to restrict horse movements and to follow relevant measures advised by the DLD. Our deepest sympathy goes out to those who have lost horses due to this terrible virus. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to update everyone and follow all protocols in order to best protect all horses in Thailand, he says. It is understood the deaths have occurred across several barns in the outbreak area. Latest research and information from the horse world.

0,"University professor Anton Pancev emphasized in an interview Alsat M that Bulgaria in no way denies the identity of the Macedonian people, but defends the identity and history of the Bulgarian people. As for territorial claims, Pancev said that Prime Minister Zoran Zaev may not have territorial claims, but it is VMRO-DPMNE that seeks recognition of the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. Yes, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev may not be there, but the other main party, VMRO-DPMNE, led by Mr. Mickoski, has categorically said that they will seek recognition of the Macedonian minority in Bulgaria. So, there is a lot of ambiguity among the Macedonian leadership on this issue. Therefore, we talk about the historical facts, it is clear that the idea of Macedonianism was raised since the XIX century by Serbia, by Serbian chauvinist circles, which had a clear national program for Greater Serbia, the eradication of Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia and the de-Bulgarianization of the Bulgarians in Macedonia. So, there are thousands of documents that prove the success of this Serbian policy in the twentieth century with all the murders, imprisonments of Bulgarians in Macedonia. So, we speak like this with facts, it is well known when the Macedonian language is officially made and actually processed. We must say here that Bulgaria does not deny the identity of these people, they have the right to have languages, histories, figures, personalities and so on. Bulgaria simply protects the identity of Bulgarians and Bulgarian history, Pancev said. Comments are closed for this post.

""I have been in regular contact with the Chinese Gymnastics Association and its President, who informs me all of their delegations are well and have shown no sign of infection."" ""Despite this, we all have to respect the Australian Government's travel restrictions."" Among the 12 Chinese entries listed on the World Cup's website are four-times world champion Zhang Chenglong, who claimed the men's team gold at the 2012 London Olympics and bronze at the Rio Games. Zhang's Rio team mates You Hao and Liu Yang will also miss out, along with Xiao Ruoteng, a former men's all-around world champion. Chinese athletes in other sports have also suffered disruptions to Olympic preparations. The entire Chinese women's soccer team and staff were confined to a Brisbane hotel for nearly two weeks due to quarantine restrictions after arriving in Australia in late-January for an Olympic qualifying tournament.

Her tongue was cut off and her spinal cord and neck were damaged because she was strangled with her chunni. Four accused have reportedly been arrested in connection with the incident. The incident took place on 14 September. Following the incident, three accused were arrested after the woman regained consciousness in an Aligarh hospital on 23 September and gave her statement to the police. The fourth accused was arrested on 26 September, Hathras SP Vikrant Vir confirmed. My mother, sister and elder brother had gone to a field to get some grass. My brother went home earlier with a large bundle of grass, while my mother and sister continued to cut them. There was bajra crop on either side of where they were. Soon, both women became a little distant from each other. Four-five people came from behind, they threw my sister dupatta around her neck and dragged her inside the bajra field, the woman brother told NDTV. My mother realised she was missing and went looking for her. My sister was found unconscious. They had raped her, he added. The woman family, however, alleged the police did not help them initially and only acted after outrage over the case. The police have denied the allegation. The incident allegedly happened at a village in the district, some 200 km from Delhi. The police did not help us initially; they did not take quick action. They acted only after four-five days, woman brother added. The Uttar Pradesh Police said they acted fast in the case. We have registered a case under (IPC) sections of gangrape, attempt to murder and SC/ST Act. The accused persons are being interrogated.

My brother went home earlier with a large bundle of grass, while my mother and sister continued to cut them. There was bajra crop on either side of where they were. Soon, both women became a little distant from each other. Four-five people came from behind, they threw my sister dupatta around her neck and dragged her inside the bajra field, the woman brother told NDTV. My mother realised she was missing and went looking for her. My sister was found unconscious. They had raped her, he added. The woman family, however, alleged the police did not help them initially and only acted after outrage over the case. The police have denied the allegation. The incident allegedly happened at a village in the district, some 200 km from Delhi. The police did not help us initially; they did not take quick action. They acted only after four-five days, woman brother added. The Uttar Pradesh Police said they acted fast in the case. We have registered a case under (IPC) sections of gangrape, attempt to murder and SC/ST Act. The accused persons are being interrogated. We have compiled all the evidence from the spot and are in the process of filing a chargesheet. We want the family to get justice and will be submitting all documents in fast-track court for immediate action, Vir said. Your email address will not be published.

The Dalit leader comments come days after he suggested the Bombay High Court asked the state government to utilise funds sanctioned for the proposed statue of his grandfather at Indu Mill in Mumbai for improvement of the cash-strapped Wadia hospitals for women and children instead. The greatness of B R Ambedkar cannot be measured with the height of a statue. It is a futile exercise undertaken by successive governments to serve their politics, Prakash Ambedkar told The Indian Express. On January 15, the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government had approved a proposal to raise the height of the proposed statue for Ambedkar by 100 feet and cleared the revised expenditure of Rs 1089.95 crore from Rs 750 crore for it. The VBA chief said, I have conveyed my reservation to the present plan for the memorial with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. I have also offered to discuss with them my original concept, which was evolved way back in 1998-99 when the NDA government was at the Centre. He added then prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had given his consent for an Ambedkar International Study Centre, but could never be translated into reality as mainstream political parties, including BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP, were keen on a memorial and a statue. What is the purpose of having another statue of Ambedkar in Mumbai? At the most, it will be taller than the ones already existing at Chembur and Vidhan Bhawan. And political parties will just take the credit for the same and use it for their vote bank in successive elections Let us not reduce the proposed Ambedkar memorial to a picnic spot or tourism centre, the Dalit leader said while pressing for a world-class study centre.

SNS Web | Kolkata | November 5, 2020 3:27 pm Amit Shah in West Bengal on Thursday (L) and Firhad Hakim. Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Firhad Hakim has hit out at BJP strongman and Union Home Minister of India, Amit Shah, for his drama of having lunch at the homes of Matua and Adivasi communities during his visit to West Bengal. Hakim, Minister of Urban Development and Municipal Affairs in West Bengal government, has said that Shah is trying to conceal the fact that Dalit and Adivasi girls are raped and burnt in BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh, hinting at the gang-rape incident and its aftermath in Hathras. In Uttar Pradesh girls of Adivasi and Dalit communities are raped and burnt. The families are denied to even perform the last rites. Dalit girls are raped daily in UP and many Adivasis are being tortured regularly in BJP-ruled states, Hakim was quoted as saying by ABP Ananda. Amit Shah is trying to hide all these with his drama. Not Matua, not Adivasi, BJP isnt there with anyone, the Chairman of Board of Administrators, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) added. Hakim also highlighted the welfare schemes and development done by the Mamata Banerjee-led government for the marginalised communities in West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee has developed the house of Matua matriarch Boro Ma. Mamata Banerjee has created the Matua board. Mamata Banerjee has created university for them. Thus, it not possible that Amit Shah will come and only have lunch and Matuas will forget everything, Hakim said. Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday announced distribution of 1.25 lakh land pattas to people settling in refugee colonies and setting up development boards for Matua and Adivasi communities for their socio-economic development. Handing over land pattas to refugees will establish their proof of residence along with ration cards as a counter to BJP effort to win them over with citizenship award. Running up to the much-important Bengal Assembly Elections next year, both the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have made special efforts to woo the Matua voters, who are believed to be 3 crores in number in a state of around 10 crore population. Matua populace, a Dalit community in Bengal, were often considered close to Banerjee ever since she became the CM. However, the affiliation suffered a blow after BJP made a massive inroads into the Matua community during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Therefore, the Namashudra community has become hot property ahead of the next year Assembly Elections. The saffron camp is attempting to consolidate their strength further, while the ruling party is trying to regain the lost ground. <!-- e9 = new Object(); e9.size = ""300x250,300x600,160x600""; //--> (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); ","Firhad Hakim also highlighted the welfare schemes and development done by Mamata Banerjee-led government for the marginalised communities in West Bengal.

The 51-mile trail would show the migration route used by newly freed slaves and other people of African descent in the 19th century. It based on the research of Naomi Mitchell Carrier, the founder of the Texas Center for African American Living History in Houston. I was able to outline some 40 or more sites that have historical markers between Reedy Chapel in Galveston and Freedmen Town in Houston, said Mitchell Carrier. That is the trail. The route would include Independence Heights, Freedmen Town and Emancipation Park in Houston. It would also include the site of Galveston Osterman building, where a Union Army General told the people of Galveston that all slaves were free. When Major General [Gordon] Granger arrived in Galveston with news that all slaves were free, he changed countless lives as well as the course of history, Sen. John Cornyn said in a statement. By commemorating the trek so many families took to spread the great news, we can honor those families and celebrate the freedom we cherish as Texans and Americans. The Texas Republican and Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, sponsored the legislation calling for the study of the trail. It passed the U.S. Senate Monday, and was previously approved by the House in May. The historic passage of the Emancipation National Historic Trail Study Act by the Senate will result in only the second trail in the United States that chronicles the experience of African Americans, Jackson Lee said in a press release. According to Jackson Lee, there only one other trail of its kind that focuses on African Americans and their experiences: the Selma to Montgomery National Historic Trail. That heritage tourism attraction generates millions of dollars, which Jackson Lee said could also happen in Texas. In addition to preserving this important heritage, the Emancipation National Historic Trail is estimated to generate millions of dollars and hundreds, if not thousands, of jobs for the Texas region economy, she said. Overall, Mitchell Carrier said creating the trail is a must for Texas and its African American history. And, this history has either been wiped from memory or prohibited from memory, she said. The National Historical Emancipation Trail is about a restoration, resurrection, and ascension of historical memory.

The girl, who suffered major injuries during the attempt to take her life, died at the Thiruvananthapuram Medical College, where she was under treatment. It was last Saturday that the teen, who is a native of Nariyampara in Kattappana, tried to take her life at her house. A few days prior to the incident, the family had filed a complaint against an auto driver in the region, stating that he sexually assaulted her. The man allegedly sexually assaulted her after falsely promising to be in a relationship with her. The girl, who was first rushed to a local hospital in the region, was then transferred to Kottayam Medical College. From there, she was taken for specialist treatment to Medical College Hospital in the state capital. Though her condition was slightly improving, her health further deteriorated on Saturday and she succumbed, reports Malayala Manorama. The accused, identified as Manu Manoj, was arrested only after the girl attempted suicide. Though there were reports that there has been a delay in arresting the accused, police officials of Kattappana station had told TNM that he was absconding. The 24-year-old accused was booked on charges on rape and various offences under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) and on charges of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The accused was a member of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), youth wing of the CPI(M). He was removed from the party after his name surfaced in the case.

Published: 14th November 2020 09:04 AM | Last Updated: 14th November 2020 11:55 AM | A+A A- Dalit leader Kameshwar Chaupal PATNA: Amid buzz that the BJP may opt for veteran Dalit leader Kameshwar Chaupal as the new deputy chief minister instead of incumbent Sushil Kumar Modi, the Bihar NDA held its first meeting after the elections on Friday. The speculation strengthened after hundreds of supporters of Chaupal raised slogans demanding his elevation as deputy CM, upon his arrival at the Patna airport. Chaupal is one of the 15 members of a trust set up on the directions of the Supreme Court to construct a Ram temple at Ayodhya. He was also accorded the rare honour of performing the first Shilanyas  laying the first brick in the foundation for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya on November 9, 1989  as part of the Sangh Parivar social engineering. He coined the slogan Ram with Roti, melding faith with livelihood. However, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar may not be comfortable with a new deputy. Sushil Modi may not have a wide vote bank but he is well experienced in running ministries like finance, some NDA leaders opined. As for Sushil Modi, the speculation is he could be sent to the Rajya Sabha on the seat that fell vacant after the demise of LJP founder Ram Vilas Paswan. Propping up Chaupal could also help the BJP build a Dalit vote bank to occupy the space vacated by LJP chief Chirag Paswan. For his part, Chaupal said he had no official word on any new assignment within the government or the party. Later in the day, Nitish submitted his resignation.

President Trump and U.S. officials had said earlier that no Americans were killed or injured in the Jan. 8 attack. Several U.S. troops were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed. As a standard procedure, all personnel in the vicinity of a blast are screened for traumatic brain injury, and if deemed appropriate are transported to a higher level of care, Capt. Bill Urban, the Central Command spokesman, said Thursday. The troops were medevaced this week to Germany and Kuwait to be treated for traumatic brain injury after experiencing concussion symptoms. Nearly one dozen American troops were wounded in Iran Jan. 8 missile attack on Iraq al-Asad air base. This week, they were medically evacuated to U.S. military hospitals in Kuwait and Landstuhl, Germany, to be treated for traumatic brain injury and to undergo further evaluation. Out of an abundance of caution, some service members were transported from Al Asad Air Base, Iraq to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, others were sent to Camp Arifjan, Kuwait, for follow-on screening, said Col. Myles Caggins, spokesman for Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve. When deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq following screening. The health and welfare of our personnel is a top priority and we will not discuss any individual medical status. Several news organizations soon reported from al-Asad that U.S. troops had been alerted to the attack hours in advance, and told to head for bunkers 15 minutes before the missiles began to strike. Many U.S. troops, however, manned exposed positions, including at least one group of drone operators who stayed in an above-ground building to get their drones aloft and avoid ground damage. The leader of an Army drone team told NPR that he was knocked off his feet by the blast. Others told the New York Times that missiles damaged the building they were in.

The incident has now snowballed into a major controversy after video of the act went viral on social media. Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati on Tuesday hit out at the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh and demanded a high-level inquiry into the incident. In a tweet, Mayawati said, In UP near Agra, the body of a Dalit woman was removed from the cremation ground by people of upper castes having casteist mentality because the cremation ghat belonged to upper castes. This is most shameful and most condemnable. In another tweet, she said, In this casteist and most disgusting incident, a high-level inquiry should be conducted by the UP government and the culprits should be given harshest punishment so that such incidents are not repeated in the future. This is the demand of the BSP. The body of the 26-year old woman was removed from the funeral pyre in Agra about a week ago by the Thakur community who said this cremation ground is not meant for people from Dalit community. Mayawati also raised the issue of the death of a Dalit doctor in Delhi who died due to coronavirus.

Nineteen-year-old Paras Jauhri was attacked by armed assailants and murdered on Monday night inside his home in Footi Colony in Jatav Mohalla. Local media reported that young activist who was in second year of BA was a witness in a case of vandalisation of Dalit icon BR Ambedkar statue. Goyal said he was attacked when he had gone to visit the family, whose residence falls in his erstwhile constituency, to offer condolences. Goyal, who represented Gwalior East in the assembly, is considered to be a staunch loyalist of Jyotiraditya Scindia and left the Congress for the BJP shortly after the erstwhile royal exit from the grand old party. Goyal had later even claimed that the Congress was trying to eliminate him. He has alleged that when he reached the police station, five to 10 people pelted stones on his four-wheeler, damaging the vehicle. Goyal sustained injuries on his face and leg. He was taken to a private hospital for treatment. Though Goyal did not lodge any complaint with the police, the latter are trying to zero in on the attackers with the help of CCTV footage. Later in the afternoon, Goyal appeared before the media and accused the Congress, saying it was coming after him because of his growing influence in the Dalit community. They can inflict as many attacks as they want, but I will continue to serve the public, he said. Hitting back, Congress leader and Dalit activist Devashish Jararia said Goyal hadnt gone to express condolence to the family. Goyal went there to ask the family not to name anyone in the FIR and settle the matter, which enraged locals, Jararia told News18, adding that the bereaved family was protesting with the body of the deceased at the police station.

Good Subscriber Account active since  Former Democratic Presidential candidate Andrew Yang rallied Asian Americans to vote against Donald Trump in what he said could be a political gamechanger for the often overlooked community. ""If we get out in force and help Joe and Kamala win, this could be the major political awakening that Asian Americans have been waiting for a generation or more,"" Yang said Monday night in a virtual fundraiser for Asian Americans Against Trump. Yang was joined by prominent Asian American leaders and public figures, including Democratic Reps. Ro Khanna and Grace Meng, Lost actor Daniel Dae Kim, Pachinko author Min Jin Lee. The American entrepreneur said Asian Americans have been ""forced to become more engaged"" politically as they continue to suffer attacks from the ""hostility"" targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) community during the coronavirus pandemic. Many Asian Americans have been vulnerable to racist attacks, as President Donald Trump has used misleading and racist terms to describe the virus which experts said exacerbates microaggressions targeting the AAPI community. Yang said engaging with politics is a ""non-choice"" and an obligation for AAPI voters. ""We have to roll our sleeves up and do things we have not done as a community as high of a level as, frankly, people in other communities,"" Yang said. ""Our community can be the margin of victory and help elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, our first Asian-American and Black woman vice president,"" NY Rep. Meng said. Asian American voters are the fastest-growing voting bloc with over 11 million eligible voters. California Rep. Khanna warned that ""anyone who thinks this election is not going to be very close, [is] underestimating Donald Trump's power to do everything possible to win. He's frankly mobilizing the power of the US government on behalf of his campaign"" and told Asian American voters that ""the only way we overcome that is by a massive turnout."" But to mobilize Asian American voters, the AAPI community must actively dispel the model minority myth, which is ""used by leaders to either be a wedge against other people of color or they are being used as some sort of pestilence,"" Lee said. Stereotyping Asian Americans as educated and hard-working, the model minority myth limits Asian Americans as people who are perfectly suited to be led, but not necessarily lead themselves. At the same time, the model minority myth does not capture the challenges that Asian Americans face and paints them under a monolithic narrative that is used as a wedge to pit them against other minorities. ""We still are in that place where we are expected to be the model minority, we are expected to be the ones who work hard, do really great work but never be the leaders,"" Kim said. ""If we can get the message out to other Asian Americans to have a say and a stake in the country where we live we will be much more respected, much more powerful, and much more considered when it comes to the politics of our country.""

Saskatchewan premier says First Nations are receiving mixed messages after Canada Indigenous services minister said sacred ceremonies would be allowed to continue despite restrictions put in place due to COVID-19. READ MORE: Inadequate COVID-19 funding focus of new court challenge by Indigenous group No one should be exempt from these health orders because, quite frankly, no one is exempt from the virus, Scott Moe said Thursday afternoon. Concern about ceremonies surfaced after RCMP were dispatched to a Saskatchewan First Nation where people were holding a sun-dance ceremony last weekend. Organizers said they worried important traditions were being pushed back underground. A federal ban on Indigenous ceremonies and potlatches came into place in 1884 and lasted until the 1950s. Minister Marc Miller said earlier Thursday that banning sacred ceremonies is a dark stain on the country history. Even in the face of a historic pandemic, Canada must not and will not prohibit these important practices, Miller said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Indigenous community leaders know what needs to be done to keep people safe. We should be able to work with them to develop ways of continuing with important customs and practices for them in a way that abides by health recommendations, he said. Saskatchewan RCMP said they received two reports of a large public gathering on the Beardy and Okemasis Cree Nation, about 90 kilometres northeast of Saskatoon, on Sunday. READ MORE: RCMP attendance at Indigenous ceremony in Saskatchewan raises ire of chief There were 35 people taking part in the ceremony, but attendees said they were following precautions set by the chief and council, including social distancing and having temperatures taken. A public-health order in Saskatchewan limits gatherings to 10 people. The Federation of Sovereign Indigenous Nations, which represents 74 First Nations in Saskatchewan, has said provincial public-health orders do not supersede First Nations laws and treaties. Indigenous Services Canada did not clarify who has jurisdiction to enforce provincial public-health orders on First Nations. Spokesperson Leslie Michelson said in an email that First Nations leaders are encouraged to consider public-health guidelines and the department respects measures put in place by chiefs and councils. Miller said First Nations leadership will ultimately decide whether to go ahead with ceremonies and how to do it. Moe, however, said there should be no exceptions, since everyone relies on the provincial health system. With respect to the comments of the minister, as well as Indigenous Services themselves, around these particular events being exempt from public health orders  that simply cannot be the case, Moe said. There were 185 positive cases of COVID-19 on First Nations reserves as of Wednesday, with 43 of them in Saskatchewan.

In an interview with the Sydney Morning Herald from Washington on June 9, Scott said America, Australia, and their allies must unite against communist China goal of world domination. We ought to do this together. All democracies are going to have to say to themselves: are they going to continue to appease the Communist Party of China, which is clearly focused on world domination and has taken jobs from democracies all over the world and stolen technologies from all over the world? said Scott. Scott remarked that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) does not believe in human rights or free and fair trade. They dont want to be a caring world citizen. Theyre willing to take away people rights. Im disgusted with how they treated Uighurs and how they treated Hong Kong citizens, said Scott. The former governor of Florida, Scott is one of the U.S. Congress most outspoken politicians on the CCP. Currently, he sits on the U.S. government sub-committee for Homeland Security and Government Affairs, and the sub-committee for the Armed Forces, among others. Scott has previously called for Americans to boycott goods made in China, urged the cancellation of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, and accused China of trying to sabotage or slow down the United State efforts to create a vaccine for the CCP virus, commonly known as novel coronavirus. Analysts have discussed the development of a new Cold War between America and China since 2018. Australian international relations expert Alan Dupont argued that a cold war between the United States and China is now a reality as both countries have gone from a framework of cooperation to one of open rivalry and strategic competition. Writing in a paper (pdf) for the Centre for Independent Studies in May, Dupont said China and the United States are now wrestling for strategic advantage in an increasingly bitter contest to determine which of them will be the pre-eminent state of the 21st century. Dupont believes that this cold war will be different from the previous one between the United States and the Soviet Union because China is more integrated into the global economy. However, Dupont wrote: It conceivable that the world could divide into two competing trade and geopolitical blocs, much like the Cold War, except that the bifurcation would be more fluid and fragmented. The first Cold War divided the world into two competing sides separated economically and politically. The communist Soviet Union controlled Eastern Europe and Central Asia, as well as supporting China, Cuba, North Korea, and Mongolia. America was supported by Western Europe, the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, to name a few. Sen. Scott wrote on Twitter on June 9 that in the New Cold War every democracy needs to show real accountability by standing up to the Chinese Communist Party. We know Communist China is our adversary, violates human rights, & wants to be the sole global power. Real accountability will come when every democracy stands up to Communist China.

The Canadian Press/Nathan Denette Visible minorities were among those hardest hit by Canada recession, with some groups reporting jobless rate increases about double those of the least affected. The unemployment rate for South Asian and Chinese Canadians was 8.8 percentage points higher on average in July from a year earlier, compared with 4.4 points higher for those who werent designated as either a visible minority or aboriginal, according to data released for the first time on Friday by the country statistics agency. Black Canadians and Filipino Canadians saw an average increase of 6.3 percentage points in their jobless rate. Adding to the picture of an uneven labor market, several minority groups had significantly higher jobless rates than the majority, the data show. Around 17 per cent of South Asian, Arab and Black Canadians were unemployed in July, compared with a national average of 11.2 per cent. Among White Canadians, the unemployment rate is 9.3 per cent.  The high unemployment rates among visible minorities may be a reflection of the industries that were disproportionately hit by c-19 shutdowns. The accommodation and food services industry saw the highest proportion of jobs lost during the height of the pandemic. Within that industry, Korean, Filipino and South East Asian Canadians are most likely to be employed. The collection of race data will provide a fuller picture of how different Canadians are coping through the crisis, and be a critical first step towards addressing inequity in our labour force, Carla Qualtrough, minister of employment, said Friday in an emailed statement. While Statistics Canada didnt release data for previous months, employment among immigrants is rebounding more slowly, suggesting a similar trend may be underway for visible minorities.

The statement made no mention of Iran, which claimed that it had fired ballistic missiles at the Ain al-Asad airbase in retaliation for the US killing of a top Iranian general. ""Between 1:45 am and 2:15 am (2245 GMT and 2315 GMT) Iraq was hit by 22 missiles, 17 on the Ain al-Asad air base and ... five on the city of Arbil,"" the Iraqi military said. ""There were no victims among the Iraqi forces,"" it added, but did not mention whether or not there were casualties among foreign troops. Ain al-Asad is the largest airbase where US-led coalition troops are based. Arbil is the capital of the Kurdish region, and a top official from the regional government said no American military base or US consulate was hit there. The official also said there were no casualties in Arbil. President Donald Trump on Tuesday took to Twitter following the strike to say an ""assessment of casualties & damages taking place now.""

0," Four caste men allegedly gangraped a 19-year-old Dalit woman in Hathras district of Uttar Pradesh on September 14, The Times of India reported on Thursday. The woman had to be admitted to the intensive care unit of a hospital after suffering serious injuries. The woman told the police in a statement on September 22 that the four men raped her on September 14 when she had gone to collect firewood. She is still in ICU but out of danger. Last week, based on a complaint by the woman brother, the police had booked a man identified as Sandeep for attempted murder, under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The family alleged Sandeep had tried to kill the woman over some old enmity. The police arrested the accused and he was remanded in judicial custody. Hathras Superintendent of Police Vikrant Vir said on Thursday that after the woman statement, gang rape charges were added to the first information report and three persons were booked. One accused has been held and the others, too, will be soon arrested, he told The Times of India. Additional Superintendent of Police Prakash Kumar said the police will file the chargesheet soon. Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Vice President Deepak Kumar met the woman and alleged that the accused were threatening her and her family. He said he will give a detailed report on the matter to party General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi and State President Ajay Kumar Lallu. Congress leader Shyoraj Jivan Valmiki met the complainant family members and demanded action against the police officers for the delay in recording her statement. He said that no injustice to members of the Dalit community would be tolerated. Earlier this month, a three-year-old girl was gangraped and killed in a sugarcane field in Uttar Pradesh Lakhimpur Kheri district. On August 28, a man in Uttar Pradesh Maharajganj district raped and murdered a 12-year-old girl and left her body in a forest. The accused took the child to eat snacks on his bicycle on Friday evening. After that, he took her to a forest, raped her and strangled her. The accused, then, returned to the village. He has been arrested. On August 24, a 17-year-old girl was found dead near her house in the same district. The police said the minor was raped before being killed with a sharp weapon. On August 14, a 13-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly raped and murdered in the district. The body of the girl, who was strangled with her tongue allegedly cut, was found in a sugarcane field owned by one of the accused.

A Dalit man died in police custody on Tuesday late night in Prakasam district after he was detained by the police allegedly for not wearing a face mask while riding on a motorcycle. The deceased Yericharla Kiran was undergoing treatment for a head injury in Guntur. However, he succumbed to his injuries. On July 18, Kiran was detained by the police for not wearing a mask and helmet in a COVID-19 hotspot of Chirala town in Prakasam district. According to police, Kiran and his friend Shini Abraham were moving on a motorcycle without masks and a constable Rami Reddy at Kothapeta check-post reprimanded them. Police allegedly found that the duo were in an inebriated condition. Police in a press note said that the duo created a ruckus and allegedly beat up the constable following which Sub-Inspector (SI) Vijay Kumar took them into custody. Police claim that Kiran jumped out of the moving police vehicle while being taken to the II Town police station, resulting in a head injury. The family members of the deceased allege that the police hit him on his head causing the fatal injury. Police said that Kiran was first shifted to the Chirala Government hospital and later to a private hospital in Guntur for better treatment. The incident has caused a furore in the state over repeated police violence against Dalits in the past two days. TDP general secretary Nara Lokesh, slamming the YSRCP government said, âDon't Dalits have a right to live under Jagan's regime?â Pointing out the cases of Varaprasad and Kiran, he said, âTo gain the appreciation of the ruling party leaders, police had tortured Varaprasad and now a Dalit youth Kiran Kumar in Prakasam district died due to police assault.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, tension prevailed in Thomaspeta area of Chirala following Kiran's death. Police deployed additional forces to prevent any untoward incident.

Six persons have been detained in this connection. According to police, the victim has been identified as Pintu Galchar, a resident of Ravi village in Dhanera taluka, who was allegedly abducted from outside his house by a group of six men around 10 pm on July 16. On Friday, around 6 am, his naked body, with several injury marks, was found near a bus stand at a tri-junction road outside Ravi village.

The deputy commander of Iraq Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was one of the Iraqi officials killed by the drone strike on Soleimani last week. Now Jawad Al Telbawi, a commander of one of the factions within the PMF, says American civilians may be targeted if they return Donald Trump to the Oval Office. After threatening the fool and a blackmailer Trump as well as the U.S. military, Al Telbawi also demanded that American citizens pressure Trump to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq before we send your soldiers back in coffins. He also suggested American civilians could be the target of terror attacks.

Arjun Kori, 50, husband of Bandoiya village panchayat chief Chotka Devi, was rushed to Sultanpur District Hospital and later referred to the trauma centre of Lucknow King George Medical University. He died on the way. Superintendent of police Dinesh Singh said the family members of the victim had filed an FIR against a person called K.K. Tiwari and four others. We are investigating the case and the guilty would be arrested soon, Singh said. Chotka Devi said Tiwari and his goons were forcing her and her husband to give him kickbacks from the development fund. They were not ready to listen to our plea that the fund is released by senior officers and monitored by them. We are not in a position to siphon off money from it. However, these people thought we were secretly making money. They called my husband on Thursday to discuss something. Later, some villagers told us that he was beaten up and set on fire, the panchayat pradhan said. Surendra Kori, the son of the victim, accused police of inaction. We had registered a complaint with the police a few months ago that some affluent villagers were threatening to kill the entire family if we didnt pay them a monthly amount from the development fund. But no action was taken at that time, he said. The seat is reserved for the Scheduled Castes. Usually, the affluent villagers field Dalits on this seat and ensure their victory.

They abducted her from the agricultural fields, raped and assaulted her in the most brutal manner lacerated her tongue, broke her neck and spinal cord, and left her paralysed on all four limbs. A little while later, her mother, who was hard of hearing, discovered her daughter in a pool of blood. But the four men, in spite of her mother presence, behaved in an aggressive and insolent manner. The four men belonged to the Thakur caste, an important political vote bank in Uttar Pradesh. It is the caste to which Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, belongs. Consequently, the Thakurs, many who consider themselves to be the political overlords, act with impunity in UP villages. Despite being a case of rape by four Thakur men, the UP Police did not book a rape case against the accused. Initially, they lodged a case of attempt to murder and another under the Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The police registered a case much later when the victim regained consciousness and gave a statement to the police. Despite the serious injuries, the police admitted the victim to a hospital in Hathras district. Later, the police moved her to the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital in Aligarh. But as her condition began to deteriorate, she was shifted to the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. But by then, it was too late. Within a few hours, on September 29, 2020, she died of a cardiac arrest.

0,"An Australian mining magnate on Wednesday unveiled a deal to import 10 million coronavirus tests from China to Australia, despite a bitter diplomatic spat between the two countries. Andrew Forrest, head of mining giant Fortescue, said he had used contacts to secure an order for the tests with Chinese genomics firm BGI Group at a significantly lower cost than from rival providers, amid fierce competition. Australia, which has been one of the most successful countries in containing COVID-19, has so far carried out around 500,000 tests in a population of 25 million people. Delivery of the new tests would dramatically improve the country's track-and-trace programme and help build the kind of monitoring needed to reopen the country's economy, said Health Minister Greg Hunt. ""What that says to Australians is we have the supply lines, we have the health capacity and we have the pathway back (to normality),"" he said. The deal comes with Australia and China at loggerheads over the pandemic. China's ruling Communist Party has angrily dismissed Australian calls for an independent investigation into the spread of the disease from the Chinese city of Wuhan. Beijing's ambassador Down Under this week threatened a trade boycott if calls for an investigation continued, leading to a public rebuke by Australian authorities. The deal comes with Australia and China at loggerheads over the pandemic Photo: AFP / Saeed KHAN US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has piled pressure on China over the pandemic, waded into the dispute Wednesday as he sarcastically said that Australia upset Beijing through its ""temerity"" to ask questions. ""Who in the world wouldn't want an investigation of how this happened to the world?"" Pompeo told reporters in Washington. ""The solution to this crisis will come from freedom-loving people around the world. I'm very confident that authoritarian regimes are poorly designed to deal with the kind of crisis that this pandemic has engendered,"" he said. Just hours after the latest verbal volley between Beijing and Canberra, the Chinese consul general in the state of Victoria, Zhou Long, spoke at the announcement of the testing deal -- calling it a tribute to the ""friendship and the cooperation between our two countries"". China had released information related to COVID-19 in an ""open, transparent and responsible manner"", he said. Australia's vast mining industry is deeply reliant on Chinese business and China has depended on Australian resources to fuel its rapid economic and infrastructure development. Forrest said his Minderoo Foundation had set aside Aus$320 million ($210 million) to assist the project, which will eventually be paid back by the taxpayer. Australia has confirmed more than 6,700 COVID-19 infections and 90 deaths, with the number of new cases falling below 20 per day for the past week. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday said the country was ""not too far away"" from easing social-distancing measures in place for more than a month.","An Australian mining magnate on Wednesday unveiled a deal to import 10 million coronavirus tests from China to Australia, despite a bitter diplomatic spat between the two countries.

0,"Bulgaria says the people of North Macedonia are Bulgarians who were stripped of their identity by Yugoslav authorities The first ever Foreign Affairs Minister of the Former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia (now known as North Macedonia) after the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991, Denko Maleski, has caused an outraged in Skopje media. As Republika wrote, Maleski continues to denigrate Macedonia and the Macedonians. A few days ago in a column he stated that Macedonians and Bulgarians were one people and that the Ilinden Uprising was an ordinary revolt; of the Bulgarian population. Maleski in a statement to Bulgarian media now says that Gotse Delchev and Krste Petkov Misirkov were Bulgarians, said Republika. When asked by the journalist what Gotse Delchev and Misirkov were, Maleski said that there are no doubts that they were Bulgarians, meaning not Macedonians. So what was the Ilinden Uprising? The Ilindin Uprising was a Bulgarian revolt in the land we now call North Macedonia against the Ottoman Empire for independence, or at the very minimum, autonomy. Despite historical revisionism from the usual suspect, there is little doubt that Delchev considered himself and his revolutionary comrades as Bulgarian and not a mythical separate Macedonian. Delchev is known as one of the most important figures in the Bulgarian struggle in Macedonia against the Ottomans. See Also: Watch video of Turkish coastguard trying to direct boat with illegal immigrants into Greek waters Misirkov was another figure who identified as Bulgarian, but had conflicting thoughts on whether Macedonia should join Bulgaria or remain independent. In another scathing statement that sent Republika into a frenzy, Maleski said We are past the time when Macedonian history was protected by the powerful Yugoslav federation and could, without pressure, selectively choose the building blocks of the Macedonian nation, and could cross out the mentions of Bulgarian and write Macedonian instead.

0,"Asia Times Covering geo-political news and current affairs across Asia Rifat Chadirji, known as the father of modern Iraqi architecture, died late Friday in the United Kingdom after contracting the novel coronavirus, friends and Iraqi officials have said. The 93-year-old architect and photographer was credited with designing some of Iraq most well-known structures, including the iconic Freedom Monument in the now protest hub of Baghdad Tahrir Square. He was a giant of 20th century Iraq, said Caecilia Pieri, a scholar focusing on Baghdad modern architecture who knew Chadirji well. Top Iraqi officials including President Barham Saleh and caretaker premier Adel Abdel Mahdi mourned him on Saturday. With the death of Rifat Chadirji, architecture in Iraq and the world has lost its modern lung, Saleh wrote. Born in Baghdad in 1926, Chadirji studied in London and returned to Iraq in the 1950s to design his magnum opus an elegant arch entitled The Unknown Soldier as well as the capital post office and other public buildings. But when the Baathist regime came to power, it tore down The Unknown Soldier, replaced it with a statue of Saddam Hussein and tossed Chadirji into the infamous Abu Ghraib prison, where he remained for 20 months. He wrote about the experience in The Wall Between Two Darknesses, relating how Saddam had him released from prison to design a conference center. Chadirji moved to Beirut a few years later and lived abroad during most of the devastating 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, the 1990 Gulf War, a decade of international sanctions and the 2003 US-led invasion that toppled Saddam. When he returned to Iraq in 2009, he was scarred by what he found. I cannot believe what has happened to the buildings in Baghdad, everything has been almost completely destroyed, Chadirji said at the time. In 2019, another one of his famed buildings was torn down: the National Insurance Company in Mosul, a seven-story building from where the Islamic State group thew men accused of being gay to their deaths. The structure was ravaged by the months-long fight to oust IS from Mosul and a municipal committee later decided to demolish what was left of it, saying it could not be restored. The NIC building was seen as a prime example of modern Iraqi design, with rows of slim archways and projected windows reminiscent of Iraq beloved shanasheel. Chadirji had been a longtime advocate of preservation, working even under Saddam to halt the demolition of traditional Iraqi architecture in Baghdad. A people that cannot take care of its creations is a people without a memory, he said in 2009.

0,"The African penguin population in Algoa Bay has plummeted by at least 30% in the last four years  and that is bad news all round, penguin specialist researcher Dr Lorien Pichegru said yesterday. The species is already officially classified as endangered, with its population having dropped 70% since 2004. About half the remaining 15,000-odd breeding pairs across the bird global range, from Namibia to the western section of the Eastern Cape coast, occur in Algoa Bay, and St Croix Island is still home to the single biggest colony, she said. But while the numbers on Bird Island have remained stable, the numbers on St Croix are declining fast, from 7,500 to 4,500 breeding pairs  so 30-40% down in the past four years. The numbers, collated during annual census surveys undertaken in partnership with SANParks and the department of environment, forestry and fisheries, were quite clear and extremely worrying, she said. Even if you dont love penguins, it should be a concern, because seabirds like penguins show us what is going on down below the surface of the ocean where we cannot easily see. What happens to the penguins is happening to the fish is happening to the fishermen and in the end will happen to all of us who rely on the oceans for food, tourism and a multitude of other reasons. There was likely a combination of reasons for the decline, she said. Some of the possible factors include that there is insufficient food which in turn could relate to climate change and fishing. Other possible factors include increased seismic survey activity and predation by seals who eat penguins when there are not enough fish. It could also be due an increase in shipping traffic in our bay related to offshore bunkering, as well as to the recent oil spills. It could also include an increased pollution load coming down our rivers. Pichegru said her assessment of the drop off in penguin numbers on St Croix correlated with an increase in the number of carcasses she had been finding during her beach surveys east of the Sundays River over the past six years.

0,"Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne has cautioned China against attempts at ""economic coercion"" as Australia pushes for an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic that China opposes. Chinese ambassador to Australia, Cheng Jingye, said in a newspaper interview on Monday the ""Chinese public"" could avoid Australian products and universities. Australia last week called for all members of the World Health Organization (WHO) to support an independent review into the origins and spread of the coronavirus, and is lobbying world leaders. China's foreign ministry has attacked the proposal. ""Maybe the ordinary people will say 'Why should we drink Australian wine? Eat Australian beef?',"" Cheng said in the interview published on the front page of The Australian Financial Review. Cheng said it was possible that tourists may have ""second thoughts"" about visiting Australia. ""The parents of the students would also think... whether this is the best place to send their kids,"" he added. After energy exports, education and tourism are Australia's biggest export industries, with China the largest market. Payne said in a statement on Monday that Australia had made a ""principled call"" for an independent review of the COVID-19 outbreak which started in the Chinese city of Wuhan. ""We reject any suggestion that economic coercion is an appropriate response to a call for such an assessment when what we need is global cooperation,"" Payne said. China is the largest export market for Australian wine and beef. During strained diplomatic relations with China in 2018, Australian wine faced import delays in China and some Australian beef exports were also previously suspended for a period. The Chinese embassy in Australia has previously warned Chinese students about what it said were safety risks in traveling to Australia.

On a complaint by the Dalit victim (Kashinath Talwar), we have booked the 13 accused and investigating the incident, which occurred at Minajgi village near Talikoti on July 18, Vijayapura district Superintendent of Police Anupam Agarwal told reporters here. Though Talwar claimed that he touched the bike by mistake and pleaded for mercy, he said the accused severely thrashed him with sticks and footwear and took off his pants while he lay on the road haplessly, Agarwal said, citing from the victim 2-page complaint in Kannada. A video clip of the assault went viral on the social media and triggered outrage in the district against the upper caste accused, as the intervention by the victim parents did not stop them from carrying the assault. Vijayapura is 524km northwest of Bengaluru. A case has been registered against the accused under the SC/ST Act and the relevant sections of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) on the assault complaint, said Agarwal. Talwar father Yankappa also alleged that he, his wife and their daughter were also attacked by the accused when they tried to rescue him from being brutally assaulted. In a related development, two-three women in the village also filed a complaint with the police against Talwar for allegedly eve-teasing and flashing before them. We have summoned Talwar to inquire about his conduct as the women alleged that he teased them, touched them inappropriately and exposed his private parts while they were washing clothes outside their houses, Agarwal said.
