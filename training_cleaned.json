[{"prompt":"Follow Us Another horrific case has emerged in north Gujarat where a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered before her body was found hanging from a tree, in order to suggest suicide, reported The Hindu. A panel of doctors at the Ahmedabad civil hospital on Wednesday, January 8, conducted the postmortem after the cops lodged a case of kidnapping, gangrape and murder against four persons. According to the report in The Hindu, the four accused had allegedly kidnapped the victim, gang-raped her before murdering her. After killing the victim, the accused hanged the body from the tree to make it look like suicide. The 19-year-old girl had gone missing on December 31, 2019, after which her family approached the police on January 3 to lodge an FIR but the local police refused. According to the report, local police inspector NL Rabri told the family that the girl was safe and had eloped with a boy of the same community and both had got married, so no case was required to be lodged. On 5 January, the victim‚Äôs body was found hanging from the tree. The Family members of the victim refused to accept the body, claiming that it was a murder and not a suicide. The police registered an FIR on Tuesday ‚Äî against Bimal Bharvad, Darshan Bharvad, Satish Bharvad and Jigar in the case. The family agreed to claim the body after registration of the FIR, after which body was sent for postmortem at the Ahmedabad civil hospital. The case was registered under various provisions and sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act after thousands of Dalits protested in front of the local police station.

Modasa Rural police have registered a case of accidental death and investigations are under way. A family member of the deceased said that the girl, a graduate, had a beauty parlour. ‚ÄúShe left home on January 1. After she didn‚Äôt return home the next day, her father had given a complaint to Modasa Town police where he had named a suspect for the mysterious disappearance of his daughter. However, (Modasa Town) the police did not register an offence and told the father that the case falls under the jurisdiction of Modasa Rural police. On Sunday morning, the woman‚Äôs body was found hanging from a tree in the neighbouring village,‚Äù said the family member. The person also alleged that the Modasa Town police did not register the case as the suspect and the police inspector are from the same community. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if she was kidnapped. But it is a fact that her body was found hanging from a tree,‚Äù the relative said. Aravalli Superintendent of Police Mayur Patil said, ‚ÄúThe woman went missing on January 1. Her family members searched for her for two days and then gave a complaint to Modasa Town police on January 3. Following the complaint, Modasa town police recorded various statements based on which her last appearance was found in this village (where the body was found). Modasa Town police then transferred the case to Modasa Rural police. And while they were investigating the case, the girl‚Äôs body was found on Sunday.‚Äù Patil said that police did not take any coercive action against the person named as suspect by the father of the woman because there was not enough evidence to do so. Inspector General of Police (Gandhinagar range under which Aravalli district falls) Mayanksinh Chavda said, ‚ÄúWe have registered a case of accidental death.

That he wanted to voice his disapproval of the CAA and the NRC is well known. In fact, his first action on being released from Tihar Jail a few days ago was to return to Jama Masjid and vent his anger against the CAA and the NRC, which he described as kaley kanoon or black laws. Azad does not mince words and is willing to hit out against the Modi government. Says he: ‚ÄúThe Jama Masjid is a place of great historicity. At the time of the partition of the country, Maulana Azad had stood here and appealed to the Muslims that they should not move to Pakistan as such a move would prove inimical to their interests. Once again, there is a move by the present government to divide the country along religious lines. I come from a village. We are all aware that the CAA and NRC will cause untold sufferings to the poor while the political class will remain unaffected. It was an imperative for me to raise my voice against such a move.‚Äù But the government claims that Azad‚Äôs presence at Jamia Masjid in December led to a heightening of tensions, so much so that it left several protestors injured at Delhi Gate. Azad insists such a criticism was false because when he was there last month, he had a copy of the Indian Constitution with him. He had only read out its Preamble to the enthused crowds. ‚ÄúI did the same when I went back to Jamia Masjid,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI read out the Preamble of our Constitution. It is the duty of every citizen to protect it. With the present government trying to divide the nation on the basis of religion, this amounts to nothing less than weakening our Constitution which is respected around the world and is looked upon as a unique document.‚Äù Had Ambedkar not authored the remarkable Constitution, Azad says, then Dalits such as myself and lakhs of people belonging to the oppressed communities would have continued to be subjected to humiliation on a daily basis, he says. Azad speaks with passion and that is one of the main reasons for his appeal amongst the youth. He also does not hesitate to take a snipe at prime minister Modi, which is why the BJP has little love lost for him. Now, the court has asked him to speak respectfully of Modi. Azad told me that he ‚Äúagrees with that‚Äù and then he quips, ‚ÄúShri Shri Modiji occupies a constitutional position but I would also request him to respect the Constitution instead of weakening the foundations of our country. I would not have opposed the CAA if he had included Tamils and Muslims rather than differentiating refugees on the basis of their faiths.‚Äù Azad says he emulates his hero, the revolutionary freedom fighter Chandrashekhar Azad. He has, of course, combined his trademark moustache with a blue scarf. He is all praise for the thousands of women who have been sitting day and night in the cold weather protesting against CAA-NRC but is unhappy over students, especially women, being beaten up in Jamia Milia Islamia and at JNU. ‚ÄúIt is very sad....thereafter, students were beaten up in JNU, AMU, DU and other universities. I am very proud of the way hundreds of our sisters along with their children have been sitting there for over a month. But if prime minister cannot hear their voices, how will he hear the voices of crores of people living in the villages?‚Äù he says. What has really alarmed Azad is the statement of RSS leader Mohan Bhagwat on Friday that there was no question of backing out from the CAA. ‚ÄúIt is alarming that this statement came not from the PM or the home minister but from the RSS. It just shows that the RSS is the BJP and the BJP is the RSS. We all know their agenda is to establish a Hindu Rashtra. The RSS has never accepted our Constitution and that is why they are jailing people for reading the Constitution. But opposition to these laws will not cease. We will fight and get these laws repealed even if this involves going to jail a thousand times,‚Äù he says, with bravado. Azad was jailed in 2017, in an environment of growing atrocities against the Dalits. The Dalits, at the same time, have emerged as an important vote bank. Was the present regime worried that Azad‚Äôs appeal amongst the Dalits was growing. Could this be one reason why he is being jailed frequently? ‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù Azad says, ‚ÄúI am being stopped from entering Delhi because I am a Dalit.‚Äù In his view, anyone who opposes the government is dubbed an anti-national, but it is the opposition parties who keep alive the spirit of democracy. ‚ÄúThe BJP believes that the more muddied the politics of this country will become, the more the lotus will bloom,‚Äù he says. Azad also clarifies that he has no plans to enter the electoral fray at present. ‚ÄúWe had thought of contesting elections but a decision has been postponed. Fighting the CAA-NRC is a much more crucial battle. I want to meet the protestors who have been jailed in UP. It is important to remove their fear and to build up a sense of solidarity across the country,‚Äù he says, adding, ‚ÄúI am ready to be led by anyone who has raised the gauntlet against the government.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere is no court bigger than the people‚Äôs court and why should the prime minister presume that he is larger than the Constitution,‚Äù he says. Agreed, no political party is leading this protest. Rather, it is being led by the people. ‚ÄúThe country is going through a very crucial juncture,‚Äù Azad says. ‚ÄúIf we do not speak up now, we will not be able to go back.‚Äù  The author is a freelance journalist.

Times of India‚Äôs Edit Page team comprises senior journalists with wide-ranging interests who debate and opine on the news and issues of the day. Politics is a lot about seizing the moment and Dalit neta Chandrashekhar Azad may have done just that when he showed up last month at the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Delhi. Over 25 days in jail may have ensued but the optics of Azad at Jama Masjid, holding aloft a copy of the Constitution with BR Ambedkar‚Äôs face adorning the cover, will endure for some time. In one stroke, Azad received the national attention he was seeking and projected himself as a votary of a Dalit-Muslim socio-political alliance. BSP supremo Mayawati has reason to worry after an unchallenged run as the country‚Äôs tallest Dalit neta since her mentor Kanshi Ram‚Äôs passing. Younger Dalits are not enthused by her aloofness and defeats in successive elections. Azad‚Äôs Bhim Army rose to prominence during the 2017 Saharanpur riots when Dalits clashed violently with Thakurs, just months after BSP‚Äôs rout and BJP‚Äôs ascendance in the UP assembly polls. Arrested and detained for over a year under the draconian National Security Act, Azad has since toned down his rhetoric in an obvious attempt to widen his appeal. But can a Dalit-Muslim alliance take hold? Muslims in Azad‚Äôs home state UP are split between SP, BSP and Congress. They made common cause with the Yadavs under the influence of Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav but ties are weakening now amid reverse consolidation by other groups. Actually Azad cannot even take Dalit support for granted. But his chutzpah marks him out. The present movement, like the anti-Emergency struggle, offers opportunities to new politicians to emerge. So the incongruity of the stiff bail terms keeping Azad out of Delhi until the assembly election sticks out. Disparate parties that sense the promise of this young politician would be happy that he is being kept away from the ‚Äòaction‚Äô, for now.  {{C_D}} {{{short}}} {{#more}} {{{long}}}...

DGP Shivanand Jha also suspended police inspector NK Rabari who was accused of delaying the registration of complaint by the woman‚Äôs relatives when she went missing. He was transferred from Modasa town police station to Isari police station in the district on January 12. The three-member SIT headed by DIG Gautam Parmar will also probe allegations against the police officers of derailing the probe and delaying the registration of the complaint. The woman‚Äôs body was found hanging from a tree on January 5, within days after she went missing. Family of the deceased alleged that the woman was kidnapped, gang-raped and murdered by four accused persons, of which three have been arrested. The fourth accused is still on the run. All the four have been booked under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Scheduled Caste & Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocity) Act. The FIR was filed on the basis of a complaint lodged by a family member of the woman. In the FIR, the complainant alleged that town police inspector Rabari did not act on a complaint that the woman went missing on January 3. The FIR states that Rabari had told the family that their daughter had married a man of her community and that Rabari would produce her along with a marriage certificate. However, on January 5, her body was found hanging from a tree in a village of Modasa. Police registered an FIR in the case against four men after Dalits from the region had protested in big numbers outside Modasa Rural police station. üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Press Esc to cancel. Educate, Agitate, Organize The endemic nature of quotidian caste atrocity and episodic inter-religious communal violence, and especially its effect on women, has historically assumed an air of eerie obviousness in the popular imagination in India. Yet the phrase ‚Äúrising intolerance‚Äù employed in recent discussions indicates a dramatic escalation of various manifestations of violence, especially since the right-wing BJP captured power in 2014. The murders of rationalists, the lynching of Dalits and Muslims on the pretext of saving the cow, the crackdown on dissenting student voices from marginalized sections or radical political traditions and the general culture of fear generated in the public sphere are unprecedented. How does one account for this contemporary rage and violence? I would tentatively engage with this question by advancing two lines of argument. First, in India the ‚Äúsocial‚Äù, configured primarily in terms of caste, is the key storehouse of power. One may locate the contemporary rage and intolerance in the dislocations within the social due to the sedimentation of neo-liberal and democratic discourses. Second, there is rising intolerance across faith traditions. Since caste is not merely a Hindu phenomenon but constitutes the specific South Asian sociality that cuts across faiths269, the ruptures in the social affect all religious collectivities. While the competitive nature of inter-religious violence or communalism, which often foregrounds ‚Äúmajority-minority‚Äù or ‚ÄúHindutva-Islamism‚Äù duopolies, is often the object of most enquiries, I would suggest that one also needs to retrieve the symbiotic and co-constitutive nature of contending communalisms as restorative attempts to preserve the de facto law of caste by elites across religions.- I Caste in South Asia has been a key mode of exclusion that has hitherto governed the distribution of power and resources. Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the foremost anti-caste theoretician and leader, termed the caste system Brahmanism and articulated it as a system of graded inequality that entailed ‚Äúa gradation of castes forming an ascending scale of reverence and a descending scale of contempt.‚Äù It is a system of ranked differences where the four major status groups or varnas‚ÄîBrahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), Vaishyas (merchants), Shudras (labourers/artisans)‚Äîare hierarchically arranged in terms of purity and pollution, with Brahmins being considered ritually the purest. There is also a fifth group of avarnas/panchamas/atishudra, now popularly recognized as Dalits, which comprise the formerly untouchables and are technically outside the fourfold caste order. Adding to the complexity of social stratification, each of these broad normative categories is further differentiated internally into endogamous and hereditary occupational groups termed jatis. In practice, jatis are probably the more functional and easily identifiable units, even when their textual hierarchy is often complicated, subverted and redefined daily in the political. As an enduring effect of orientalist discourse, caste has been usually framed as a Hindu phenomenon but empirically it has organized social life in all religious traditions‚Äîincluding Islam and Christianity‚Äîin India. For instance, among Muslims three kinds of status groups can be identified: One, those who trace their origin to foreign lands and the converts from Hindu higher castes (ashraf); two, the converts from clean occupational castes (ajlaf); and three, the converts from the formerly untouchable (Dalit) castes (arzal). Moreover, the Ashraf constitute the highest stratum within this structure. Their position and rank within the Muslim caste system is almost identical with that which the Brahman and Kshatriya grouped together are granted in the Hindu caste hierarchy. Thus, both the Sayyad and Shaikh, as competent religious pedagogues and priests, are almost identical with the Brahman; whereas both the Mughal and Pathan, being famous for their chivalry, appear to be equal to the Kshatriya. In recent decades, the Pasmanda movement, organized by the lower-caste Muslims in order to challenge upper-caste hegemony within Indian Islam, tries to address this gap. The Pasmanda discourse has foregrounded the complicity of upper-caste Muslim elites in sustaining and reproducing communal discourse that is often instrumental in legitimizing episodes of communal violence. In fact, there is a stress on the dialectical relationship between majority and minority communalisms and the Pasmanda movement proposes to contest minoritarian fundamentalism from within in order to wage a decisive battle against majoritarian fundamentalism at the national level. Ali Anwar, the leader of the movement, opines thus: We see that the politics of communalism, fuelled by both Hindu and Muslim elites, is aimed at dividing us, making us fight among ourselves, so that the elites continue to rule over us as they have been doing for centuries. This is why we‚Ä¶have been seeking to steer our people from emotional politics to politics centred on issues of survival and daily existence and social justice, and for this we have been working with non-Muslim Dalit and Backward Caste movements and groups to struggle jointly for our rights and to oppose the politics of communalism fuelled by Hindu and Muslim ‚Äòupper‚Äô caste elites.

The Congress and the BJP in Madhya Pradesh hit out at each other after a 24-year-old Dalit man was set ablaze in Sagar district on Tuesday, 14 January. Dhanprasad Ahirwar was doused in kerosene and set on fire by his neighbours Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan, and is battling for life in Bhopal's Hamidia Hospital with over 70 percent burns, Motinagar police station in charge Sangita Singh said on Saturday, 18 January. Ahirwar had filed a police complaint over a dispute and the accused were forcing him to take it back, Singh said, adding that Chhuttu, Ajju Pathan, Kallu and Irfan had been arrested. Leader of Opposition in the MP Assembly Gopal Bhargava visited Ahirwar in Hamidia Hospital and claimed crimes against Dalits were increasing under the Kamal Nath government. State BJP president Rakesh Singh said Ahirwar had told police three times that his life was in danger but he got no help from the authorities. He said police did not act on Ahirwar's apprehensions because of the Congress-led government's vote-bank politics and policy of appeasement. The MP Congress, meanwhile, hit out at the BJP and said it was giving a communal colour to every issue. \"\"The BJP needs to change its perception of seeing communal politics in every issue.

The court has also imposed a total fine of Rs 26,000 on them. The body of the 30-year-old woman was found with her throat slit and stab marks on 25 November, 2019, a day after the offence. The woman used to sell balloons for a living. Three men were arrested on November 27 and charged under relevant sections of the Indan Penal Code for gang rape and murder besides the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, Additional Public Prosecutor M Ramana Reddy said. The court found them guilty under all the sections and awarded the death penalty. The three accused had earlier pleaded not guilty.
